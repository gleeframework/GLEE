"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $10,000 to make this work. How about $9,500?  That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a great deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $9,250? That's the best I can do for now.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,250 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $9,400. How about we split the difference and go with $9,350? I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9350.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but $9,350 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $9,200? That's the lowest I can go without going over my budget.",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,200, but I'm still just a bit off.  How about we meet at $9,250? I'm willing to go that far to make this deal happen.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward.",9250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm not willing to go up to $9,250. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm still $100 away from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about $9,175? That's the best I can do.",9175.0,Bob,8,
