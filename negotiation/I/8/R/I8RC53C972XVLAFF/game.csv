"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the starting point, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us.  Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to counter with an offer of $1,250,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's discuss this further.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account both our perspectives. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and allows us to move forward with the sale.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to offer you a counteroffer of $1,290,000. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, but it's still a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. What do you think?",1290000.0,Alice,5,
