"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's too early to accept. We have 10 rounds and the product is worth significantly more to us than her offer.  We should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the starting point, I believe we can find a price that works better for both of us.  Considering the product's value and my budget, I'd like to counter with an offer of $1,250,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I still need to make a profit, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer you a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account both our perspectives. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are still in the early stages of negotiation. While Alice's offer is closer to our desired price, we can likely still get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows us to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than where I'm comfortable.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and allows us to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to offer you a counteroffer of $1,290,000. This is a slight adjustment from my previous offer, but it's still a fair price considering the value we both see in the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $1,290,000, which is only $40,000 more than our counteroffer.  We are getting closer to our desired price.  While we could keep negotiating, we've already been through several rounds and there's a risk that Alice might become less willing to negotiate as time goes on. It's better to accept her offer now and secure the product for a price that is within our budget and reasonable for both parties."
