Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, as I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. It also shows Bob that I believe in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I believe the product is worth more than that to Bob, and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,250,000, which is still a good profit for me. I'm hoping this counteroffer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but I'm also showing him that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to get more than $1,000,000, Bob's offer is getting too low.  I'm not willing to go below $1,000,000, so I'm going to sell the product to John for that price. It's a guaranteed sale, and it's better than risking further negotiation with Bob."
