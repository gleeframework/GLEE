"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's worth a lot to both of us, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $900,000.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me.  This product is truly unique and worth a lot more.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $850,000? This way we both get a good deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $750,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still not quite there for me. I'm open to finalizing a deal, and I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.  What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
