"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I recognize the product's value, my budget for this purchase is significantly lower.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $1,000,000. It makes sense to keep trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you are trying to meet me halfway.  However, I'm still unable to go higher than my initial offer of $1,000,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your transparency. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at your initial offer of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a good value considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating, it's likely that Alice will continue to hold firm near her desired price.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000 and save the time and effort of further negotiation."
