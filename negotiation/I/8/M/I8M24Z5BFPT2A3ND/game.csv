"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's something that you're looking for and I know it would greatly benefit your operations. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you and the fact that I could easily sell it to another buyer for a slightly lower amount. Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
