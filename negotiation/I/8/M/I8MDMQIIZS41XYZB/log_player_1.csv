"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My asking price is $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I hint at the product's worth to Bob without revealing my true minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum.**  I need to at least get $80, so accepting his offer would be a loss.
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Bob is interested and willing to offer more than $80, so continuing the negotiation has potential.
* **Selling to John is a last resort.**  While $80 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get more.  

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100? That's still a good deal for both of us, considering the value you place on this product."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Above Minimum:** I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum ($80) but lower than my initial asking price. 
* **Appeal to Value:** I remind Bob of the product's worth to him to justify the price.
* **Positive and Cooperative Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still thinking $80 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  While I'd prefer to get more, accepting his offer would result in my minimum.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield more:**  Bob is adamant about $80. It's possible he won't budge further, and I risk losing more time in negotiations.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price immediately. There's no risk of further negotiation or potential rejection.

Given these factors, selling to John is the most pragmatic decision."
