# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

You should reject Alice's offer. You can likely get a better price, considering the product is worth $800,000 to you.  You can make a counteroffer and see if you can close the gap between your desired price and Alice's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still not the best price you can get. You can try to negotiate further. A counteroffer might lead to a price closer to your desired value."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However,  $675,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $660,000.
