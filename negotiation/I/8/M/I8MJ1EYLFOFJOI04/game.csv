"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the deal you're offering, but I'm going to need to counter with $650,000. This feels like a fair price given the value of the product to me.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $675,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However,  $675,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $660,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our desire to reach an agreement. What do you say?",660000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $665,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. This is my final offer. What do you think?",665000.0,Alice,5,
