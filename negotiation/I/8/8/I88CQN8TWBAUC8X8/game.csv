"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm very interested in the product but I can only offer $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we compromise at $12,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, the value of this product to me is quite high.  I could consider letting it go for $14,000.  This is my final offer.",14000.0,Alice,5,
