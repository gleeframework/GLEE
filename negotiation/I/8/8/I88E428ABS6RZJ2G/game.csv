"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $750,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $850,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $850,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering purchasing from another seller at that price. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're considering purchasing from another seller at $800,000, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slight discount to stay ahead of the competition, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $825,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is truly my final offer. If you don't accept, I'll be forced to move forward with the other seller.",800000.0,Bob,6,
