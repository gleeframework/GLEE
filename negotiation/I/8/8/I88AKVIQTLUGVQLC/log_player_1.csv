"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I want to see if he's willing to come up a bit more before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show some flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping this will incentivize Bob to come up a little more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit, and we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale entirely."
