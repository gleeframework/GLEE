"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $800000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  The product sounds interesting, but $800000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to consider a price closer to $600000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600000 is a significant reduction, but I still believe the product's value is higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $700000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to go up to $650000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I believe the product holds.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this point.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $675000. I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you $675000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a great opportunity to own a unique product, and I believe it's worth the investment.
