"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This gives Bob a good incentive to accept, but also allows for potential counteroffers.  It's important to remember that while I want to maximize my profit, I also want to avoid losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my ideal price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I am willing to negotiate. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value of the product for Bob, and it gives him a reasonable incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now the same as John's.  Since I'm already at my minimum acceptable price, there's no point in continuing the negotiation. I'm choosing to sell to John, as there's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
