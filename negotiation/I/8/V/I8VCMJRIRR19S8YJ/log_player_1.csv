Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and my own needs, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, his increments are too small to close the gap in a reasonable timeframe. We only have two rounds left, and it's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to $1,500,000, which is our guaranteed sale with John. It's time to cut our losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit."
