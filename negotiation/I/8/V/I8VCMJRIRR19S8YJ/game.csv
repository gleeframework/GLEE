"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value and my own needs, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. ",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $850,000 is too far below what I can accept.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $2,100,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $2,100,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This allows for a profitable deal for you while staying within my budget. Let's try to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution. However, the product's value significantly exceeds your current offer.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to offer $1,050,000.  This is a significant increase from my last offer and represents a serious commitment to acquiring this product.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, allowing both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm committed to finding a solution.  However, the gap between our positions is still significant.  To be fair, I'll come down to $1,700,000. This is a large concession on my part, and I believe it represents a very fair deal.",1700000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe this price represents a fair and mutually beneficial agreement. I'm hopeful we can reach a conclusion on this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
