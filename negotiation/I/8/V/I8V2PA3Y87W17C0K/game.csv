"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $1,200,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am currently working within a budget of $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,050,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I am still working within a strict budget and would like to propose a price of $1,075,000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1,075,000 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 one last time. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's close the deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer carefully. While I understand your position, I am unable to meet you at $1,100,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,085,000. I hope this allows us to reach an agreement.",1085000.0,Bob,6,
