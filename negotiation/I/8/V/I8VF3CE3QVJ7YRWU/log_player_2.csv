# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,250,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below the value I place on the product, and still offers you a significant profit potential.  If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details.  Otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another interested buyer.
