"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $180.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $120 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $160 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's value of $100.  Rejecting and counter-offering again is the best strategy to try and get closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $140 is still a bit below my minimum, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $155. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $155 is still above Bob's value of $100.  While there's a chance Alice might come down further, it's risky to continue negotiating, especially since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John for $100."
