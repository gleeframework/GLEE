"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $120 for it. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is still a bit below my minimum, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $155. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",155.0,Alice,5,
