"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go down to $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250?  This would give you a significant discount from my original offer and still allow me to cover my costs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,750. I'm still a bit short of my budget, but I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can get closer to my target price. Can we discuss further?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear your commitment to buying the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can come down a little further to $13,000.  This offer reflects a substantial discount from my initial price and represents a significant investment on your part. Let's try to bridge the gap and make this work.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I need to be at or below $12,500. Can we meet at $12,750 or lower?",12500.0,Bob,6,
