"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While $12,000 is better than selling to John,  I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob. I'll try to counter his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to walk away if we can't reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $12,500 is close to my bottom line, and he's made it clear he's not willing to budge further. It's better to secure the deal for $12,500 than risk losing him and having to settle for John's $10,000 offer."
