"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,250,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product, reflecting its value and my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product without exceeding his budget. While he could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice will budge, and there's the risk of losing the deal entirely.  Buying from John would cost the same, so this is the most efficient option."
