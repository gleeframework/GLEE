"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly lower than my minimum value ($120). 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive and encouraging tone can help foster a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By starting at $100, I leave room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for potential compromise. 
* **Maintaining flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I can still choose to counteroffer or sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking for a price closer to my budget. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining value:** While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiating room:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the leverage to negotiate a higher price in future rounds. 
* **Not rushing the deal:**  I have 10 rounds to close the deal, and there's no need to rush into a subpar offer.

I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $95? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to closing this deal. Let's work together to find a solution!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a middle ground:** I'm aiming for a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($85). This shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Reiterating the value:**  I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to remind Bob of the product's worth and encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Collaborative tone:** The message uses a collaborative tone (""let's work together"") to maintain a positive and productive negotiation.
* **Staying flexible:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can adjust my strategy based on his response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:**  $90 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my desired target. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm choosing to reject the offer to keep the pressure on Bob and demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a quick sale. 
* **More negotiation rounds available:** We still have 6 rounds left, so there's time to potentially secure a better price. 

**Next move:** I'll counteroffer again in the next round, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to come down to $92.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession by dropping the price from $95 to $92.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm framing the $92 price as a ""fair price"" for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Urgency:**  I'm subtly adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we can ""finalize this deal."" 
* **Strategic middle ground:**  $92 is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's. It's a reasonable price that might tempt him to accept. 

**Next steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to assess the situation and determine if I should continue negotiating with him or move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget, how about $88? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Not meeting minimum:**  $88 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product.
* **Remaining rounds:** With 4 rounds left, there's still time to explore other options. 
* **Possible counteroffer:**  I can counteroffer with a slightly higher price, aiming to find a middle ground. 

**Next move:**  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a more acceptable price for both of us. If that fails, I'll consider selling to John in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. $90 is a fair price that respects both our needs.  It's time to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic compromise:** I'm offering $90, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $92 and Bob's latest offer of $88.
* **Emphasizing finality:** I'm stressing that it's ""time to close this deal,"" adding a sense of urgency and implying that further negotiations might be unlikely.
* **Reiterating fairness:** I'm again framing the price as ""fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise.

**Next steps:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round.  I'm starting to run out of time, and I need to ensure I get a price that's worth my time and effort."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could we agree on $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  With only 2 rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to negotiate a price that meets my minimum requirements. 
* **Close but not enough:** While $87 is closer to my desired range, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Guaranteed sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, securing a better financial outcome than accepting Bob's offer. 

I've attempted to negotiate with Bob, but the offers haven't met my minimum requirements. It's better to secure a guaranteed sale to John, ensuring a reasonable profit."
