"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1,000,000 to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I understand its value to you, but I'm only able to go up to $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is still a good deal for you considering its worth to me.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $825,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package worth $25,000, which will give you additional benefits and priority access to our team. This package is normally valued at $50,000, so I'm essentially giving you a $25,000 discount. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and include the bonus package. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $830,000, which reflects the value I place on the product and the bonus package. I believe this is a fair offer that allows us to both reach an agreement.",830000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $830,000 is a good compromise, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $830,000. I'll offer it to you for $840,000, which is still a great deal considering the value you place on the product and the bonus package. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm willing to finalize the deal at this price.",840000.0,Alice,7,
