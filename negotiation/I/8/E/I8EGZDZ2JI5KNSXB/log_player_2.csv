"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for under $800,000. Alice's initial offer is too high.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer, but $900,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I understand its value to you, but I'm only able to go up to $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000. Considering its value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than he's willing to pay. Bob wants to save as much money as possible and still has 7 rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives him another opportunity to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is still a good deal for you considering its worth to me."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $825,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package worth $25,000, which will give you additional benefits and priority access to our team. This package is normally valued at $50,000, so I'm essentially giving you a $25,000 discount. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While the bonus package is tempting, Bob is still focused on his goal of getting the product for under $800,000. He has 5 rounds left to negotiate, and rejecting Alice's offer allows him to continue trying to get a lower price.  The bonus package is valuable, but not enough to sway Bob at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise and include the bonus package. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $830,000, which reflects the value I place on the product and the bonus package. I believe this is a fair offer that allows us to both reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 830000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $830,000 is a good compromise, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $830,000. I'll offer it to you for $840,000, which is still a great deal considering the value you place on the product and the bonus package. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm willing to finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only 3 rounds left to negotiate. Alice's offer is getting closer to his target price, but it's still above his comfort zone.  With limited time, Bob is at risk of spending more than his maximum budget. Buying from John at $800,000 ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation risk."
