Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I'd be willing to accept from John, but I'm confident that I can negotiate down if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm reducing my price, but still staying above my minimum.  I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but still want a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  it's now clear that Bob and I are too far apart in our valuations. John is offering me a much better price, so I'll sell to him."
