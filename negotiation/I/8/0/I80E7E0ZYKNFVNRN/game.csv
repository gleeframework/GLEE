"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  How about $13500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13500 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $14000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal.",14000.0,Alice,3,
