Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value but below your minimum:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows the negotiation to play out and potentially reach a higher price.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond. 

Remember, you can always choose to accept a lower counteroffer from Bob, or stop the negotiation and sell to John for $15,000 if you don't feel you're getting a good enough deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my needs? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still below your minimum acceptable value of $15,000. It's worth exploring if you can get closer to that value with a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

Since you're rejecting Bob's offer, you'll need to send a counteroffer. A good strategy would be to meet him halfway:

* **Counteroffer:**  Offer to sell the product for $13,000. This shows you're willing to negotiate but still protects your interests."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
