"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for us to negotiate.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately too high for my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the value to me, and it gives us both a good starting point for negotiation. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your financial constraints. While I'm eager to make this deal work, $850,000 doesn't quite cover my minimum asking price. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering the value and would allow us both to close this deal successfully. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this. I'm offering the product to you for $925,000. This price is still within my acceptable range, and it's a significant step towards closing this deal. I'm hopeful that you'll agree to this offer, as I believe it's a fair price for both parties.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $925,000 is still slightly above what I can comfortably pay. I'm willing to go up to $910,000.  This is a very fair price and would allow us to finalize this deal without delay. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to make this work, but $910,000 just isn't enough for me to let go of this product.  I understand we're close, but I need to make sure I'm getting fair value.  To bridge the gap and finalize this deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $915,000.  This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, and I truly hope you'll consider it.
