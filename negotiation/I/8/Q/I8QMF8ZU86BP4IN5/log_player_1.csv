"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe your initial offer undervalues the product significantly.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,100,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $700,000. If that's not workable, we might need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more. We're still far apart, but I'm not ready to settle for less than $1,000,000 when I have John as a backup option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we try this: $950,000.  I think that reflects a fair compromise, considering the value it brings."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $750,000. However, I need to be realistic; that's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has given his final offer, and it's clear he won't go higher than $750,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation when I have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000 from John. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit."
