"Bob, I believe this product is incredibly valuable and could greatly benefit your business. I'm initially offering it to you for $1,500,000. I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment at this price.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe your initial offer undervalues the product significantly.  Let's meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $1,100,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can go up to $700,000. If that's not workable, we might need to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we try this: $950,000.  I think that reflects a fair compromise, considering the value it brings.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget to $750,000. However, I need to be realistic; that's the absolute highest I can go.",750000.0,Bob,6,
