"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but it gives you a good deal considering its potential benefits. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
