{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You're aware that the product holds a value of $1,500,000 for Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value increases the chance of a quick sale at a high profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, still landing you well above your minimum price. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so there's no pressure to drastically undervalue the product."
