"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product is good, but not $1.6 million good. How about we bring it down closer to reality? ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation.  While $1.6 million may have been a starting point, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price better reflects the true value and potential this product offers you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to be serious about this, so let's try to find some middle ground. Would you consider $1,000,000?  That's my limit.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is  below what I can accept.  This product is truly exceptional and its value is undeniable. I'm prepared to make my final offer at $1,150,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
