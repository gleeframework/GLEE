Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  This product is good, but not $1.6 million good. How about we bring it down closer to reality?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you engaging in this negotiation.  While $1.6 million may have been a starting point, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. I believe this price better reflects the true value and potential this product offers you."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to be serious about this, so let's try to find some middle ground. Would you consider $1,000,000?  That's my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has now reached his stated limit of $1,000,000. However, I know I can get $1,200,000 from John. It's time to push Bob a little further and see if he's willing to budge."
