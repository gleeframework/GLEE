"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is certainly appealing, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering the returns you stand to gain. I could come down to $1,050,000.  I believe this price point reflects a balance between its worth and our mutual desire for a successful deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000.  This price is fair given my research and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
