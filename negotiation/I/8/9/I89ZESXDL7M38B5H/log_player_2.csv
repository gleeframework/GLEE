Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $950,000 is certainly appealing, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering the returns you stand to gain. I could come down to $1,050,000.  I believe this price point reflects a balance between its worth and our mutual desire for a successful deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
