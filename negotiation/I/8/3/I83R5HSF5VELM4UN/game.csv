"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85 to make this work. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, $65 was a bit optimistic.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $75 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. How about we split the difference and go with $80? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us.",80.0,Alice,5,
