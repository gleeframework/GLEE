"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $100. He values the product at $120 and Alice's offer leaves room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm looking to pay closer to $90. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be fair but also aggressive in his counteroffer. $90 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above Alice's perceived value of $80, leaving room for further negotiation. This shows Alice he's serious about buying the product while also trying to secure a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $95?  This still leaves plenty of room for you to get a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate. He values the product at $120 and can afford to pay more than $95, but there's no reason to rush into a deal at this point. He can try to push for a price closer to his target of $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $95 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can settle closer to my initial offer of $90.  Would you consider $92? That would give you a good profit and save me some money. "", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for his target price of $90 but recognizes he needs to be more realistic. By offering $92, he's showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to save as much as possible. It's a small step closer to Alice's offer, and could potentially lead to a quick agreement."
