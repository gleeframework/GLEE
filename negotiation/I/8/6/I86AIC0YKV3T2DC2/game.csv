"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe my product has a significant value to offer. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000.  It's the best I can do at this time. ",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? I think this is a fair compromise that will allow us both to come away from this deal feeling satisfied.",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it.",10750.0,Alice,7,
