"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Considering its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. I believe this is a fair offer, given its potential benefits for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget.
* **Strategic move:** Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Alternative:** Buying from John for $15,000 is a backup option, but Bob should try to negotiate with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Considering the value you mentioned, I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible, but still secure the product.

* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer shows Bob's seriousness and willingness to negotiate, while also highlighting the value he places on the product.
* **Next steps:** Bob will wait for Alice's response and be prepared to make further concessions if necessary, but will also be willing to walk away if Alice isn't willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I think that's a fair compromise that reflects the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there. How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise and a good starting point for us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible, but still secure the product.
* **Counteroffer:** $11,500 is a compromise, closer to Alice's offer but still below Bob's maximum budget.

* **Next steps:** Bob will wait for Alice's response and be prepared to make further concessions if necessary. However, he'll be willing to walk away if Alice isn't willing to meet him halfway."
