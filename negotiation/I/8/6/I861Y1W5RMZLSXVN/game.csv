"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it at $100, which I think strikes a balance between its worth and your perceived value.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to buy the product for $85. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a value proposition you can appreciate.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we agree on $90 for the product? This still allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being competitive with your offer.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer you $87.50 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, and we can finalize the transaction.",87.5,Bob,4,
