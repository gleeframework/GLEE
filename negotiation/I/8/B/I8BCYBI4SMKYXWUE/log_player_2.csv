"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum budget is $12,000, there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer right away. Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price. You can then start making counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to come down on her price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, considering it's a one-time purchase for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $12,000 to $11,000, which is a good start. However, you still have room to negotiate further.  You can continue to counteroffer and try to get the price down to a level that you are comfortable with.  It's worth seeing if you can get her lower than $10,000."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably spend. I'm going to stick with my offer of $9,000.  If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might need to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $9000, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is a decent price. It's only $500 over your initial counteroffer of $9,000. It's a good compromise and a better deal than buying from John for $12,000. It's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate much further, so it's best to accept this offer."
