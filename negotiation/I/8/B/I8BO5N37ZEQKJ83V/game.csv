"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you consider $750,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the product's value while still being a good deal for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal.  $800,000 is still a touch high for me. How about we settle at $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,6,
