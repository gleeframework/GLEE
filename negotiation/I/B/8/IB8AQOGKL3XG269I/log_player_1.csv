Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still only willing to pay $100. It's the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. Let's see if we can make this work.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still out of my price range. How about we settle at $110? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a tough one! While I'd prefer to get closer to $130, waiting longer carries the risk of Bob walking away entirely.  $110 is a decent profit over my minimum, and it's better to secure the deal now."
