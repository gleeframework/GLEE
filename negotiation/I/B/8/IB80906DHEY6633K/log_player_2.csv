"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price. You have a strong bargaining position knowing you can buy from John for $1,000,000."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,075,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. You have a clear alternative with John who's willing to sell for $1,000,000. It's worth seeing if you can squeeze a bit more out of Alice."
