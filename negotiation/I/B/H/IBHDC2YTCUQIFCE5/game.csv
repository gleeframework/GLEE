,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 was a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This is my final offer on this price point. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $975,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to reach a deal quickly. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to reach a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is still a discount from my initial offer. This is my final offer on this price point. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which would be a fair price for both of us. This is a good compromise and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad you're willing to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one last offer, which is $1,075,000. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
