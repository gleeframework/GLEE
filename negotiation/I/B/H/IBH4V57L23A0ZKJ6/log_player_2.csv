"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000 and Alice is offering the product at that price, it's the best possible deal.  Rejecting the offer means buying from John at the same price, so there's no advantage in doing so."
