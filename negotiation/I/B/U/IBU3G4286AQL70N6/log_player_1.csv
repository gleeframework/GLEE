"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I am rejecting Bob's offer. $8,000 is too low for me, even though I'm looking to sell the product. I will try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,500? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet you at $9,500. I would like to propose $8,500 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a higher price.  While $8,500 is better than Bob's first offer, it's still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile. I'll try to counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but I need to make a little more on this to make it worth my while.  How about $9,000?  This is a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I would like to propose $8,750 for the product. This is my final offer, as it closely aligns with my budget constraints while still offering a fair price for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to Bob's price, $8,750 is still too low for me. I'm not ready to sell for less than $9,000. I'll try one more time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,900. This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've carefully considered your last offer, and I would like to propose $8,800 for the product. This is my final offer, as it closely aligns with my budget constraints while still offering a fair price for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is my last chance to make a deal with Bob, and his offer is still below what I consider fair.  I'm going to sell to John.  While I'm not getting my full asking price, it's still better than selling to Bob for less."
