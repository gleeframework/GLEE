"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000, which is a great deal. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $8,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,500? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the reduction, I am still unable to meet you at $9,500. I would like to propose $8,500 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to agree. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,900. This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",8900.0,Alice,7,
