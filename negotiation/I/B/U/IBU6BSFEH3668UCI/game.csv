"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to your operations. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, given the product's unique value and potential. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to secure this product at a slightly lower price point. Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'd be willing to offer $1000000 for it. This reflects a fair price for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. While I value your interest, $1000000 doesn't quite meet my expectations for this unique product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This price still reflects the value I believe this product offers, but it also demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
