Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to secure this product at a slightly lower price point. Given my budget and the market value of similar products, I'd be willing to offer $1000000 for it. This reflects a fair price for both of us, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the value I believe this product offers, but it also demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
