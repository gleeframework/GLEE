Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start negotiations high with Bob. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, the message hints at the product's ""immense value and potential,"" attempting to justify the high price. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency (""limited-time offer"") and scarcity (""other interested parties"") to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price. 

**Important:** This strategy involves risk. If Bob is put off by the high price and doesn't counter-offer, you might miss out on the opportunity to sell above your minimum price."
