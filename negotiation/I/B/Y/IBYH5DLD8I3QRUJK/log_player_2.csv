"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I am extending this opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $95. This is an excellent chance to acquire a product worth more to you than its cost, enhancing your experience and efficiency. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer is a bit lower than her product's value to her, it's still more than you want to spend. You know you can get the product for $80 from John, so rejecting this offer makes the most sense."
