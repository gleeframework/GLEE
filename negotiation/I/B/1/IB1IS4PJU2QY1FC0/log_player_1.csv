Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value, but I'm also acknowledging Bob's lower valuation.  This leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to negotiate further, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but I'm still demonstrating flexibility. This counteroffer shows I'm willing to meet halfway, but also that I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum value. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further concessions outweighs the potential gain. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower final sale."
