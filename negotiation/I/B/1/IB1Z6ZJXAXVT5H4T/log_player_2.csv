"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $12,000.
* Alice is offering the product for $11,500.
* There's room for negotiation, as Alice values the product at $10,000. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering $11,000, which is $500 less than Alice's initial offer. 
* This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it leaves some room for compromise.
* I'm confident that Alice will be willing to accept this offer, as it's still above her value for the product ($10,000)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $11,250.
* This is closer to my desired price, and still leaves me with a potential saving compared to buying from John.
* At this point, continuing to negotiate might take more time and might not lead to a significantly better price.  
* It's more efficient to accept the offer and secure the product for a reasonable price."
