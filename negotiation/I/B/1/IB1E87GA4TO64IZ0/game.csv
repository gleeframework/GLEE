"Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $12000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12500. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",12500.0,Alice,1,
