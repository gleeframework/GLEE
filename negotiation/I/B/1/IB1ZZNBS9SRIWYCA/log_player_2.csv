"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  It's better to counteroffer or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $1,200,000 is well above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm glad you're willing to negotiate. However, $800,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,000,000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,000,000 is closer to his budget, it's still over his limit. He should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is my best offer, but I'm open to a compromise.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering $950,000. This is my best compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $950,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching a deal increases with each round.  John offers a guaranteed deal within Bob's budget, making it the safest option at this point."
