"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $12,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't settle for that low of an offer yet. I have 8 more rounds to potentially reach a better agreement with him or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I'm still willing to negotiate, but I can't go any lower than that."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I'm willing to pay, but I still think $8000 is a more reasonable price. How about we meet at $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $8,500 is still quite a bit below my minimum goal of $12,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, as I have 6 more rounds to try and get a better offer. If I don't see progress soon, I'll consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $9,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $8750 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $8,750 is still significantly below my minimum goal of $12,000. I have 4 more rounds to try and get a better offer from Bob.  I'm hoping to get a higher price and will only sell to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $9,000? This feels fair to both of us and allows us to close the deal.  Time is running out, so I'm hoping we can finalize this soon."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not willing to go to $9000. How about we meet at $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $8,800 is still significantly below my minimum goal of $12,000. I only have two more rounds to try and get a better offer from Bob.  I'm hoping to get a higher price and will only sell to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting very close.  I'm willing to come down to $8,900. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move forward with selling to John."", ""product_price"": 8900}
