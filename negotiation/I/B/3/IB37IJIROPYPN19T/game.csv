"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product significantly exceeds $900,000. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
