"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I am only able to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still unable to meet you at $10,500. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000. I hope this is within your consideration.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  This way, we both get a little closer to our desired price.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to agree to $10,250. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",10000.0,Bob,6,
