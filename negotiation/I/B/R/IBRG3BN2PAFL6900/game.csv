Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.,13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $13000 on it at this time. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
