"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a very competitive price. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I believe this is a great opportunity for both of us. I'm asking for $12,500. This leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll get. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,
