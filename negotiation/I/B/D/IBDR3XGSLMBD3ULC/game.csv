"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my final offer, as I have other interested buyers.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. Considering your final offer comment, how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This offer stands for this round only.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer. I can go down to $1,450,000, but this is absolutely my final offer. I need a decision this round.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're so close!  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000.  Given it's your final offer, I need you to meet me halfway for us to agree. This is my final offer.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
