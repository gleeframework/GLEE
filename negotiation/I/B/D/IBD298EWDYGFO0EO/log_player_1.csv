Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You still have a chance to make a profit. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** This encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than immediately rejecting the offer. 

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I can still do better.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob!  $130 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference at $135?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Can you meet me at $132? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer $135, Bob's offer of $132 is getting closer to my minimum.  It's also a good price considering he's willing to pay a bit more. I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
