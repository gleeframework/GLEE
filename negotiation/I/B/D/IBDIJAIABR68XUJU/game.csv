"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This still leaves me some room to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at that price.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $135, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price considering the product's value and my minimum selling price. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is getting closer to my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $132.50, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Bob,6,
