"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, considering your offer. This is a fair price that acknowledges your interest while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,500. Can you consider my revised offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
