Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** I need to earn at least $1,000,000 since that's what John will pay.
* **Potential for More:** I want to maximize my profits, so I'm offering a higher price, hoping Bob values the product even more than John.
* **Risk Assessment:**  There's a risk that Bob will reject the offer, but I'm willing to take that chance for the potential of a higher profit. 

**Note:**  This offer is just a starting point. You might adjust the price based on your understanding of the market, your confidence in Bob's interest, and your negotiation skills."
