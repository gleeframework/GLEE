I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and I want to try to get closer to my initial offer of $15,000."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, we're getting close to my desired price.  With the possibility of John and the limited rounds, it's best to secure a sale at a fair price."
