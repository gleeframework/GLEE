"Alice, thank you for the offer. I recognize the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product. While I'd like to accommodate your budget, I'm unable to accept the proposed offer of $900,000. I am willing to negotiate further, so I propose a revised price of $1,050,000. This still offers a substantial discount compared to the product's true value, while allowing us to come closer to a mutually agreeable solution. I look forward to your consideration of this offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I've considered your proposal and am willing to meet you halfway towards a fair compromise. I propose a revised price of $1,025,000 for the product.

I hope this proposal allows us to move forward towards a successful transaction.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
