"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to pay $15,000 for the product. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000? This would align better with my financial situation.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still feel that $12,500 is too high for me. Could we possibly meet closer to my budget, perhaps at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
