"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to leave room for negotiation. This also gives me an idea of Bob's interest level right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $7500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, offering a price closer to my minimum but still leaving room for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $8750 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $8000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
