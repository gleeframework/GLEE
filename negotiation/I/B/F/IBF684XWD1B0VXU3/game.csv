"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $1200000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident that it will be a worthwhile investment for you. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1200000. Would you consider lowering the price to $950000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950000 is still below what I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1050000 is still beyond my budget, I would like to propose a price of $975000. I hope this might be a price point that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but I'm still not quite comfortable with $975000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1012500.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product holds. Let's close this deal.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm grateful for your efforts in negotiating, Alice. I'd like to counter with a price of $990000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",990000.0,Bob,6,
