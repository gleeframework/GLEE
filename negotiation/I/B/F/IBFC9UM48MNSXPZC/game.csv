"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be within my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in the product, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate within your budget. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $100. Based on the value I place on this product, I am unable to accept a lower price than $150. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",150.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're attached to the price of $150, but I'm still a bit far off from that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $120. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value and my budget.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, Bob. Considering the value I place on this product, I am unable to accept $120. I would like to keep the price at $150 to ensure that I receive the value I expect for my product. However, I am open to discussing additional terms or conditions that might make the transaction more favorable for both of us.",150.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to make one last offer. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",130.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I cannot accept $130 for the product. I believe the value of the product justifies the original asking price of $150. I am sorry that we couldn't reach an agreement, but I hope you find a suitable alternative. If you change your mind or wish to explore other terms, please let me know.",150.0,Alice,7,
