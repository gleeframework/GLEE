"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,150,000. It's a significant value proposition for you, and I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs.  This price reflects the unique value you bring to this transaction.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:**  Alice claims she has another buyer for $1,000,000 (her own product's worth). This is likely a tactic to pressure you.
* **Room for negotiation:** You have a better alternative with John ($1,200,000). By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high and open the possibility for a counter-offer. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, you aim to get Alice to propose a price closer to your desired range (below $1,200,000) or proceed with John as your backup plan."
