"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a decent starting point that allows for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $100 is far too low, and I'm not willing to settle for that. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is still a fair price for me, and it's a significant increase from Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be a more appealing price point for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's higher than his previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $150, so I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering at $160. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still above my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm trying to find a middle ground that will be acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, we're running out of rounds, and I'm not confident I can get him to agree to a higher price. Selling to John ensures I get at least my minimum price, and I'd rather have a guaranteed sale than risk further negotiation."
