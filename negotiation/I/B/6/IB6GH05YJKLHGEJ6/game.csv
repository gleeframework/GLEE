"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $9000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. Considering the value it will bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer.

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand that you're still not willing to meet me at my original price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
