"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can do $120, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested!",120.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $75. I can meet you halfway between $120 and $75, so how about $97.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",97.5,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80, Bob. That's below my minimum price. I can do $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",110.0,Alice,7,
