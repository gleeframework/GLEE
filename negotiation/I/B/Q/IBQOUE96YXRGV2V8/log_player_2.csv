"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,200,000).  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,300,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save a bit more, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,275,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,275,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price and within his budget.  While a lower price is always better,  accepting this offer is a good compromise and avoids the risk of further negotiations, especially with the threat of needing to buy from John at a higher price."
