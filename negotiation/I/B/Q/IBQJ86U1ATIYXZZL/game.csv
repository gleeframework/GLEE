"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1500000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1100000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900000 is still below what I need to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's aim for $1000000. This would be a fair price that allows us to both achieve our goals.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1000000 is still slightly out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $950000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to achieve our goals. Let's see if we can make this work.",950000.0,Bob,6,
