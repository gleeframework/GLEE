"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $105. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway, but still above my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a higher price, it's getting close to my minimum and it's better than selling to John.  I'm starting to run out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
