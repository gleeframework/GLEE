**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still significantly higher than my budget of $8,000.  While we've made some progress in negotiations, I'm not comfortable going any higher.  Given the time constraint and my desire to save as much money as possible, I'll choose to buy the product from John for $8,000."
