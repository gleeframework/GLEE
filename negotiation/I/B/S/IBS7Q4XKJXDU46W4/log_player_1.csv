"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, as it's worth much more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob values the product highly.  This allows for negotiation room while still ensuring I get a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent offer, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This is a fair price for both of us, let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,000 is a compromise for you, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,200 is still too low for me, but I'm starting to run out of time. I'll make one last counteroffer and see if Bob will budge.  If not, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth for a while now. I'm going to make one final offer.  I'm willing to come down to $9,700 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's the best I can do.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,700, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,400 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's still not my ideal price, it's only $300 less than my last offer and getting closer to my desired amount.  I'm worried that if I reject his offer, we'll keep going back and forth, and I may end up selling to John for a much lower price. It's time to close the deal."
