Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I believe you'll find great value in it. I'm willing to part with it for $11,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to get even more from Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,000 is a significant saving for Bob compared to the product's worth to him ($8,000). This makes the offer very tempting. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is $11,000, there might be a slight possibility for Bob to negotiate a slightly higher price, getting me closer to my maximum potential profit."
