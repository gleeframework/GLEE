Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and value, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a price closer to $10,000. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a fair price considering the quality and features of the product."", ""product_price"": 19000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. Let's try to bridge that. I'm willing to accept $16,500 for the product. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 16500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $16,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit steep for me. Could you do $13,500? That would make a big difference for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is slowly increasing his offers, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering in the next few rounds.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John at this point."
