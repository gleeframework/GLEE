"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a price closer to $10,000. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This is a fair price considering the quality and features of the product.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $19,000 is still outside my budget. I could potentially go up to $12,000 if that works for you?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations here. Let's try to bridge that. I'm willing to accept $16,500 for the product. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to find a middle ground.",16500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $16,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit steep for me. Could you do $13,500? That would make a big difference for me.",13500.0,Bob,6,
