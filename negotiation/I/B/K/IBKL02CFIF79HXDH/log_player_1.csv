"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than Bob's estimated worth ($8,000), hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my minimum of $8,000. I'm also opening the communication with a friendly message to encourage a good negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? It's still a great deal for you and it's closer to my asking price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can offer $7,000 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's clear that we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $8,000. This ensures I get at least my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
