"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price significantly higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation and potentially a good deal for both of us. It also gives Bob a clear indication that I'm serious about selling the product and I'm open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired profit margin. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
