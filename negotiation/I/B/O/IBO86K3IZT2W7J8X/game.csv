,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested but $130 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $110?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this work!",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. How about $115? That's a good compromise and closer to what I can afford.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",115.0,Bob,4,
