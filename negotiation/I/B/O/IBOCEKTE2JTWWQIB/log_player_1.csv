Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this. However, $1,200,000 is quite a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering its true market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000.

I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.
