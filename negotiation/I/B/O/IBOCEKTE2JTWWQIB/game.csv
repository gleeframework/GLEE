"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this. However, $1,200,000 is quite a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering its true market value.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,000,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair and reasonable, considering the value you place on the product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,000,000 is closer to the mark, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $650,000?  I'm serious about purchasing the product, and I believe this offer reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $650,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $900,000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
