Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest in the product.  I'll be prepared to negotiate downwards, but I want to see how much he's willing to pay.  If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust accordingly. If his offer isn't satisfactory, I'll have the option to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price. I'll counter with a price that's more appealing to me than $15,000, while still showing I'm willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm countering with $16,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer. I want to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not desperate to sell for his price. Hopefully, this will lead to a final price that is closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but I still believe I can get a better price. His latest offer is too low for me to accept at this stage. I'm going to counter with a price that is closer to his offer, but still reflects the value I'm placing on the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm offering $15,000. This is a significant compromise on my previous offer, but it's still a respectable price for the product. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway.  If not, I'm prepared to sell to John and avoid any further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I believe I can get a better deal by selling to John. It's a lot less risk, and I'll get my minimum value."
