"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in a high-value asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the market value of the product is worth $800,000 to you.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but the price is a bit too high for me at the moment. I'm willing to offer $600,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to me, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite ready to agree to that price. How about we settle at $700,000? I feel this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while working within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
