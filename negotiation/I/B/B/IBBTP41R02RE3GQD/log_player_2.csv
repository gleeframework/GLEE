"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $925,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000, but you can get a better deal from John.
* John offers the product for $1,000,000, saving you $75,000 compared to Alice's offer.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate a better price or proceed to buy from John, who offers a more favorable price."
