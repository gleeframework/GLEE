Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I think this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible, maximizing profit beyond the $800,000 guarantee from John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high at $925,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, while still potentially securing a price significantly higher than $800,000.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the product's value and benefits to Bob helps justify the high price and increases the chances of acceptance. 

This strategy aims for the best-case scenario while ensuring Alice doesn't lose out on the guaranteed sale to John."
