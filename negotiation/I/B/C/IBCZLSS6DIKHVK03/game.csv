"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, but I can't go any higher.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you need to get a fair price, but $1,100,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value this product will bring to your business. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  My final offer is $925,000.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're close, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not comfortable going any lower than $975,000. I think this is the sweet spot where both of us can walk away feeling satisfied. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,7,
