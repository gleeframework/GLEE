"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 You're looking to save as much money as possible, and $100 is still higher than your target price of $120. It's worth negotiating with Alice further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate the product, but $100 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. How about we meet at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still aiming for a lower price, and $105 is outside of your ideal range. You can counter again and try to push closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? This would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can do $98, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $98 is still higher than your ideal price, it's only $2 more than your target. You've successfully negotiated down significantly from the original $100, and continuing to negotiate might lead to you running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price. It's a good compromise to accept Alice's offer."
