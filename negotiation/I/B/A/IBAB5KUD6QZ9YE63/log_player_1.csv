"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing an initial price of $2,200,000. This offer reflects the true worth of this product and the substantial benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique"" and ""valuable"" nature to justify the high asking price.
* **Confidence:** Projecting confidence about the product's value is key to anchoring the negotiation in my favor.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor High:**  Establish a high reference point that influences Bob's perception of the product's value.
2. **Gather Information:**  Observe Bob's reaction to the initial offer to understand his negotiation style and potential budget.

By starting high, I'm positioning myself for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial offer is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, given its potential value to me.  I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, considering your desired sale and my financial limitations.  Let's discuss further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is above his perceived value but still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to accept and secure a profit, I believe there's room for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about my valuation of the product.  I'll use the next round to present a counteroffer that moves closer to his price while still remaining above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is generous, the product's unique value and market potential necessitate a higher price point. I'm willing to consider $1,900,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my initial asking price while acknowledging the product's true worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $300,000, showing Bob I'm flexible and open to reaching an agreement. 
* **Holding Ground:** The new price is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum. This keeps the pressure on Bob to justify his valuation and potentially increase his offer further. 
* **Reiteration of Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's high value to maintain a strong negotiating position. 

**Goal:** 

My goal is to encourage a counteroffer from Bob that's closer to my desired price range while avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,900,000 is still outside my comfortable range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This demonstrates my serious interest while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in further rounds, there's a risk that:

* **Bob walks away:**  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, but further pressure might make him reconsider. 
* **Time runs out:** We're approaching the halfway point in the negotiation rounds.  

Accepting this offer secures a significant profit ($400,000) and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
