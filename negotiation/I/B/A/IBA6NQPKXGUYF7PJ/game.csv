"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. While I agree this product holds a lot of value, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $800,000. I believe this is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $825,000. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
