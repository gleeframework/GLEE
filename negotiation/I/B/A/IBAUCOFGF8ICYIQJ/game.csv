"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm asking for $1000000. I believe it has the potential to be equally valuable for you, and I'm open to discussing your perspective.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $750000 is tempting, it's a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $850000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $850000.  I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800000?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
