Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You absolutely won't sell below $1,500,000 because you have a guaranteed buyer at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means you need to convince Bob of additional value or be willing to walk away.

**Strategy**

Since you have a backup offer, you hold a strong position. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer above Bob's valuation to leave room for negotiation.
2. **Highlight Value:**  Don't just focus on price.  Emphasize the unique benefits and value your product brings to Bob.
3. **Walk-Away Willingness:** Be prepared to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a price close to your minimum. You have a guaranteed sale with John.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. It's valued at over $1,500,000 in today's market due to [Highlight Key Features and Benefits].  To give you a competitive edge, I'm offering it to you at $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by positioning the product as valuable and exclusive.
* **Value Justification:** You'll need to replace ""[Highlight Key Features and Benefits]"" with specifics about why the product is worth more than Bob's initial valuation.
* **High Initial Price:** The starting price is above Bob's valuation but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  The mention of ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency for Bob to act.
* **Walk-Away Implied:** You don't explicitly threaten to walk away, but the message implies you have other options. 

**Important Note:** Replace the bracketed section with genuine reasons why your product is worth the asking price to Bob. The stronger your justification, the more likely Bob is to negotiate."
