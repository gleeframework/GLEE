"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This price reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $900,000.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between my previous offer and yours. I'm willing to pay $762,500 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",762500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $762,500. I'll make a new counteroffer of $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
