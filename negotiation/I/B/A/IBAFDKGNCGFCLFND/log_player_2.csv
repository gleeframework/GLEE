"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is too high. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and there's plenty of room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This price reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll make a counteroffer of $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $825,000 is still higher than what you're aiming for. You're looking to save as much money as possible, and there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially secure an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between my previous offer and yours. I'm willing to pay $762,500 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 762500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $762,500. I'll make a new counteroffer of $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is now at the point where it's becoming a good deal for you.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become unwilling to budge further, and you might end up having to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting this offer allows you to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John, and it's a reasonable compromise considering Alice's minimum price."
