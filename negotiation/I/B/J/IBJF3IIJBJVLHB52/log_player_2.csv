**Reasoning:** 

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and take John's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** She's stated her final offer is $13,000 and has shown resistance to going lower. 
* **John offers a better deal:**  Buying from John at $12,000 is a guaranteed saving of $1,000 compared to Alice's final offer.
* **Limited time and potential for stalemate:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice could lead to a stalemate, leaving you with less time to secure the product from John. 

While there's a slim chance Alice might reconsider, the risk of missing out on John's offer outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly lower price from Alice."
