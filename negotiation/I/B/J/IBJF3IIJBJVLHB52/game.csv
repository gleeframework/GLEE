"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree it's a good product, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $10,000. It's a fair price considering my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $11,000? I'm eager to make a deal and this price gets us closer.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I can go while still making a profit. I hope you can meet me in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the price, so I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit. How about $12,000?  That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $12,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",13000.0,Alice,7,
