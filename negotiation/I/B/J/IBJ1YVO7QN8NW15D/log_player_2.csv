"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to me, and I believe it could be valuable to you as well. Let's start by discussing a fair price. My initial offer is $95 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget.**  Since the product is worth no more than $100 to you, $95 is a good starting point but leaves room for negotiation.
* **You want to try and get a better price.** You have 10 rounds, so you have time to see if you can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $95 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. Considering the value of the product and my current situation, I am able to consider an offer closer to $90. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is willing to negotiate.** She lowered her price by $5, showing flexibility. This suggests further negotiation is possible.
* **$90 is still close to your maximum budget.** You can likely squeeze out a bit more by making another counteroffer. 
* **You have plenty of rounds remaining.** You're still early in the negotiation, and you can afford to keep pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $90 is still a bit high for me. How about $88? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. I'm willing to go down to $89 for the product. This is the lowest I can go while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has come down to $89.**  This is very close to your counteroffer of $88 and a significant discount from her initial offer of $95.
* **You have saved $11.** This is a good saving compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation may not be worth it.**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, but it seems she's reached her limit.  Pushing for a lower price might risk losing the deal altogether, which would force you to buy from John at a higher price."
