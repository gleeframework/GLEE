"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe it's worth considering, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to discuss further?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $1000000 for it. Would you be open to discussing that?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concern about the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for in the market. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However,  $1100000 is still a bit steep for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $1050000. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close a deal at this level.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. I'll meet you at $1075000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
