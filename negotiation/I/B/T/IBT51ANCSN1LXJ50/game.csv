"Bob, I understand your position, but $1100000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial price.  Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1250000?  This is a good price for both of us, and allows me to get closer to my desired value while still providing you with a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1250000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is the price John is offering. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'd like to know if you're willing to accept it.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
