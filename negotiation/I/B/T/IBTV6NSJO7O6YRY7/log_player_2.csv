"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $150. This is a significantly higher price than you are willing to pay. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

``` 

While $130 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
