Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a profit for Alice. 
* **Psychological Pricing:** $119 seems like a more attractive deal than a rounded number like $120, potentially increasing the chance of Bob accepting.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $119. He might try to negotiate further, or he might outright reject the offer. However, this strategy gives Alice the best chance of maximizing her profit."
