"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to his $8,000 limit as possible. Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above his $8,000 limit.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price he's comfortable with. There's always the option of buying from John for $8,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to get as close to his $8,000 limit as possible without completely breaking down the negotiation. Offering $8,750 shows a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for Alice to potentially make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,900 is very close to Bob's budget, it's still $900 more than what John is selling it for. Bob values saving as much money as possible, and buying from John is the most financially beneficial decision. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the chance to buy from John, especially if Alice decides to stick to her $8,900 price."
