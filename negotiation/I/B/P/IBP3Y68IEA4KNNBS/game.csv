,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. How about $105?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $105 is a bit too low for me, considering what this product is worth.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $110 is still a little more than I'd like to spend.  Let's try $108.  It's a good price for both of us, and it lets us finalize this deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
