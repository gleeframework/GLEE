"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a high starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation and reflects the value I place on the product. I'm hoping Bob will be intrigued and engage in further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my desired price and I believe there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to risk another round and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show good faith and encourage Bob to meet me halfway.  This counteroffer keeps the price closer to my desired value while acknowledging Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for improvement.  I'm willing to risk another round and see if I can get a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm dropping the price to $1,200,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that should be attractive to Bob while still ensuring I get a price I'm comfortable with."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting dangerously close to John's offer.  With only a few rounds left, the risk of a further decline in price outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price. It's time to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
