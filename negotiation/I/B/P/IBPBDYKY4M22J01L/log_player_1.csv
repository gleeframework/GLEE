Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows her product's worth ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000).  She starts with a strong offer of $14,000, leaving room for negotiation but staying well above Bob's valuation and her minimum.
* **Creating Urgency:** By offering a ""great deal,"" Alice subtly implies this is a limited-time offer, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a safety net with John, guaranteeing she won't sell below her minimum price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer somewhat appealing to Bob. There's a chance Bob might negotiate down, but Alice is in a strong position to counter-offer effectively."
