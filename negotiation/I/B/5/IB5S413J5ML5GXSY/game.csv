"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is simply out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than what you're proposing. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a substantial offer that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
