"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120?  I think it's still a great price for a product of this quality.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $100.  I'm really serious about buying this, but I need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
