{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential compromise. It also expresses a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, which might encourage Bob to negotiate rather than immediately reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,150,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than my absolute minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm not willing to sell for that amount, so I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you have budget constraints, but I'm willing to come down to $1,180,000 to make this deal work. This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget limitations. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1180000}
