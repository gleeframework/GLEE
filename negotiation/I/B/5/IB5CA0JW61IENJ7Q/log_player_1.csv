"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is a good price, I'm holding out for a bit more. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John. I'll see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come up a bit.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid losing a deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is now higher than what John is offering, and it's closer to my minimum of $15,000.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
