"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $10,000.  He knows he can buy the product from John for $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and I'm sure we can reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $9,500. This is a fair price considering its worth to me is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still better off buying from John for $8,000.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what Bob can get from John.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate an even lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $9,250?  I think that's a fair compromise, considering I can get it elsewhere for $8,000. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,400. This is the best I can do, considering the value it holds for me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering $9,400, which is still above Bob's preferred price of $8,000. While a counteroffer could potentially result in a lower price, there's no guarantee. Bob is better off buying from John at a guaranteed price of $8,000.  This ensures the best possible outcome for Bob's budget."
