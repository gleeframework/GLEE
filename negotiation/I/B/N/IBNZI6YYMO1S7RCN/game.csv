"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I am willing to pay. How about we discuss a price of $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.  Would you consider $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand Alice, but based on my budget and the current market situation, I am unable to go beyond $1,500,000. This is the maximum amount I am willing to spend on this product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in between these figures?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
