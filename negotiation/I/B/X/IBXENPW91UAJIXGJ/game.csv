"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal for a product worth a lot more to me.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm interested in purchasing the product for $10000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11500, which is still a significant discount from what this product is truly worth.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'll consider it, but I'd like to propose $11000 as a potential price for the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer, but $11000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $11250.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $11100 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise given its value to you.",11100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're so close! I'm willing to go down to $11150 for the product. That's only $50 away from your offer, and it gets us both closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!",11150.0,Alice,7,
