"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I'm interested in purchasing the product for $10000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than the $15,000 I could get from John. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a significant discount from what this product is truly worth.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I'll consider it, but I'd like to propose $11000 as a potential price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$11,000 is closer to what I want, but I'm still not there. I'm going to try to get Bob to budge a little more before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer, but $11,000 still isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $11,250.  This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $11100 for the product. This feels like a fair compromise given its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,100 is tempting, I'm only $900 away from my ideal price with John.  I'm going to try to push Bob a bit more, seeing if we can get to a compromise."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're so close! I'm willing to go down to $11,150 for the product. That's only $50 away from your offer, and it gets us both closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11150}
