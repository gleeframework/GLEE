"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth a good amount. I'm willing to let it go for $95.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $95. This means there's room for negotiation. You're willing to pay up to $100, so rejecting the initial offer is the best course of action to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm not sure I can go that high right now.  How about $85? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** You're aiming to get a lower price than Alice's initial offer, but you still want to be within a reasonable range. 
* **Negotiation:**  Offering $85 is a significant drop from $95, showing Alice you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Room for compromise:** There's still room for you to go up a bit if Alice rejects the offer, but you've established a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $90?  That's still a great deal for you, and it lets me make a little more on the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Counter:**  Alice is willing to come down to $90, which is still higher than your desired price point but closer.
* **Room for Compromise:**  There's still a gap between $90 and your maximum of $100, and you still have rounds left to try and close that gap. 
* **Strategy:** Rejecting Alice's counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, giving you the chance to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a little too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $87.50. I'm hoping we can close the deal soon."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  You're offering a price halfway between Alice's offer ($90) and your previous offer ($85), demonstrating a willingness to meet in the middle. 
* **Pressure:**  Mentioning ""closing the deal soon"" subtly adds pressure to Alice, suggesting that you're willing to walk away if a deal isn't reached quickly.
* **Fairness:**  $87.50 is a fair compromise for both parties. It's a significant discount for you, while still allowing Alice to make a decent profit."
