I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $1,000,000.  We're close to the middle ground, and I think I can push him a little further."

We've gone back and forth a few times, and while Bob is getting closer to my price, it's clear he's not going to meet my minimum. I'm running out of time, and I'm confident that I can get my minimum from John. It's time to move on to a more reliable buyer."
