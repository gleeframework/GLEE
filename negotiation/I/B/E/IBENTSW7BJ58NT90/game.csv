"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, and I'm still very interested in the product. However, $920,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about we split the difference and go with $885,000?  That would be a good compromise for both of us.",885000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $885,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $910,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go at this point.",910000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $910,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $895,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",895000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $895,000, but I need to think about it for a moment. Can I get back to you with a final counteroffer? In the meantime, I'll also consider selling to John for $800,000 if we can't come to an agreement.",895000.0,Alice,7,
