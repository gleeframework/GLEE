"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her value for the product ($900,000 vs $800,000), but still leaves room for negotiation. It is also lower than what Bob is willing to pay from John ($900,000 vs $1,000,000).  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Bob wants to get the best deal, so he's starting with a price lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than her value for the product. This demonstrates his willingness to negotiate without being unreasonable.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By offering $850,000, Bob leaves some room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's losing too much.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages a collaborative negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer from $900,000 to $920,000.  While it's closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than his initial counteroffer of $850,000. Bob should continue to negotiate to try to get the price closer to his desired range."

{""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, and I'm still very interested in the product. However, $920,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  How about we split the difference and go with $885,000?  That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 885000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Bob is offering a compromise by splitting the difference between his previous offer ($850,000) and Alice's current offer ($920,000).

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $885,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $910,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down a bit from $920,000 to $910,000, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  He can still try to negotiate a lower price, especially since he's willing to pay up to $1,000,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $910,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $895,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 895000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** Bob is persistent in trying to get a better deal, recognizing that Alice is likely to come down further.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $895,000, but I need to think about it for a moment. Can I get back to you with a final counteroffer? In the meantime, I'll also consider selling to John for $800,000 if we can't come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $895,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $895,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is the best so far:** Alice has finally agreed to Bob's desired price of $895,000. This is a good deal for Bob, considering his willingness to pay $1,000,000 to John.
* **Avoids further negotiation:**  Accepting the offer avoids further negotiation, which could lead to delays or a breakdown in the deal. 
* **Possible counter-offer from Alice:**  While Alice is considering selling to John for $800,000 if they can't agree, it's a long shot. It's more likely that she will accept Bob's offer, given that she's already come down to his price and hinted at a potential deal."
