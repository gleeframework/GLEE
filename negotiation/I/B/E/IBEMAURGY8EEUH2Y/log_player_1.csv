Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit with Bob:** $200,000 (Bob's Value - Your Minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the deal attractive enough to accept.  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value is ideal, but you need to leave him some room for profit to motivate his purchase.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. I believe it holds immense value for you, and I'm confident it can significantly benefit your [mention how the product benefits Bob]. Given its unique potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000 
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds perceived value.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the product's benefits to Bob reinforces its worth in his mind.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 gives Bob a potential $50,000 gain, making your offer very attractive while securing you a significant portion of the potential profit.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. In real-world scenarios, multiple rounds of offers and counter-offers would be expected."
