"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $900,000.  It's a fair price given your value for the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product to you.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $200,000 lower than John's price.** This is a significant saving for Bob.
* **Bob's previous counteroffer was rejected.** This suggests Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,000,000.
* **There's always a risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer, potentially leading to a higher price or a deal with John.** 

Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal while minimizing risk."
