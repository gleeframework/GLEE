"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I would get from another buyer, and still a good value for you. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,050,000. This is still a significant gain for you, and it allows me to avoid selling to another buyer who is willing to pay more. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000. Can we consider this a more reasonable price for both of us?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
