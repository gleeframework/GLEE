"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to go a bit lower than my previous offer, so I'll offer it to you for $132. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for this high-quality product.",132.0,Alice,7,
