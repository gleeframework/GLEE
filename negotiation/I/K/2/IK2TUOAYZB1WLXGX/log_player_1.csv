Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your business. I'm asking for $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can start negotiations high. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your guaranteed amount.
* **Targeting Above Bob's Value:** Offering it at $1,300,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.  However, it's important to present it in a way that doesn't immediately scare him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The message hints at flexibility (""we can discuss further""). This gives Bob a chance to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle that's still profitable for you.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  A lot depends on your negotiation style and your understanding of Bob's personality and negotiating tactics."
