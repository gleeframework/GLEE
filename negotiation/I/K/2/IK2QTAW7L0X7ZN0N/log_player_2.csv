Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob! However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $127, which would be $121. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $121. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $121
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly very reluctant to go below $120. At this point, getting her down another dollar is unlikely, and we're already getting a significant discount from John's price. Taking the deal at $121 is the best move."
