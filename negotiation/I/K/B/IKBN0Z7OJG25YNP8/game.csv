"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your initial offer, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. Let me know if this works for you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
