Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can offer you $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $110? It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm sticking to my original offer of $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems pretty firm on his offer of $100. I've already rejected him once and am not sure another counteroffer will get him to budge.  I'm confident I can sell the product to John for $120, which is more than Bob is offering."
