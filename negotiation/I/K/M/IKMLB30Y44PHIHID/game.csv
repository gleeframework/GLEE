"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1200000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Can you consider that price point?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe the product's value is worth more than that, but I'm open to further discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that price point?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting a bit far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but that's my final concession. If we can't meet in the middle, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I still think $950000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $980000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that price point?",980000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $980000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1010000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to start considering other options.",1010000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to think we're getting too far apart, Alice. I'm willing to make one final offer at $990000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options, including buying from a competitor.",990000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand you're trying to make one final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $990000. I'm willing to come down to $1020000, but that's my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for the full $1500000.",1020000.0,Alice,9,
