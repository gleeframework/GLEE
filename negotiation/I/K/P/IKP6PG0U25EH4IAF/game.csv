"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering the potential benefits it holds for someone like you.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget of $800,000. Can you meet me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the value this product brings.  While $1,200,000 is below what I had in mind, I'm willing to move from my initial offer.  How about we meet at $1,850,000? This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $1,400,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
