"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a steal for something worth so much to you! Let's make a deal.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far below what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $720,000?  That's a significant increase from my last offer and gets us closer to a deal.",720000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $720,000 is still a bit too far off for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $785,000?  This would allow you to get the product at a price that's still within your budget while ensuring I get a fair price for its value. What do you say?",785000.0,Alice,5,
