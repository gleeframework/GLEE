Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far below what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
