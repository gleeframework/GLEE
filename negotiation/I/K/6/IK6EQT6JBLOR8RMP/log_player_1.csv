Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a steal for something worth so much to you! Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's estimated value of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a positive and friendly tone in my message can help keep Bob engaged and willing to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, hoping to motivate him to pay a bit more.
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000, so I can comfortably walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations. 

I'm prepared to negotiate down from this price, but I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** While I can't accept his offer, I'm willing to continue negotiating. I believe there is room to meet somewhere in the middle, especially considering the product's value to Bob.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,000,000 provides me with the flexibility to be firm in my negotiations with Bob.

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is far below what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This still leaves you a significant profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from the initial $950,000, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but not by a huge margin.  
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, emphasizing the potential for profit.
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $850,000 is still much closer to my desired price point and well above Bob's initial offer.  
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to finding a solution. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping my goals in mind, and still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $720,000?  That's a significant increase from my last offer and gets us closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is higher than his previous one, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating. Bob has shown he's willing to increase his offer, which is a positive sign.
* **John's offer is my safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through.

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, but I'll be careful to avoid going too low too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $720,000 is still a bit too far off for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $785,000?  This would allow you to get the product at a price that's still within your budget while ensuring I get a fair price for its value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 785000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's roughly the average of my previous offer ($850,000) and Bob's current offer ($720,000). This shows that I'm willing to compromise and find a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:** I'm highlighting that this price would allow Bob to get the product within his budget while ensuring I receive a fair price.
* **Staying Firm:** I'm still negotiating towards my goal of $1,000,000 but showing flexibility. 

This counteroffer aims to reach a compromise while still ensuring I get a good deal for the product."
