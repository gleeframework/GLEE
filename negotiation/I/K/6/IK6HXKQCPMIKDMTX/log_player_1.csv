Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $9,500."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $9,500 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a great deal for Alice.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing John will buy the product for $8,000 provides a safety net.  Alice doesn't need to go below that price."
