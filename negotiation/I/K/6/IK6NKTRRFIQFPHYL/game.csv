"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While it seems like a good fit, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be reasonable. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
