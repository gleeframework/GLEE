"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000). This indicates there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better price.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair price for both of us. This is my final offer before I consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and still leaves a significant profit margin for Alice. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price while avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal to another buyer."
