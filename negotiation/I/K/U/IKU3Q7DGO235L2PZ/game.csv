"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item that's worth $15,000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me a bit, Alice.  How about $11,500? That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $11,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to go up to $13,500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Let me know if that works for you.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we're hitting a wall here. I'm willing to make one final offer at $12,000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
