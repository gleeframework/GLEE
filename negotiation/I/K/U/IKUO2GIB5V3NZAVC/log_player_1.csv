Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal and worth every penny!  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my desired price, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. This will give me a good starting point for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $120 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
