"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you for $12,000. That's a great price considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $9,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be at least at $11,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. How about we try $10,250? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $10,250 is still a bit too low for me, considering the value of this product.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,750?  I think that's a fair compromise, and it's the closest I can come to your last offer.",10750.0,Alice,5,
