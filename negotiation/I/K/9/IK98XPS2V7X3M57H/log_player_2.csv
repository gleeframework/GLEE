Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate that.  $77.50 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet at $80?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's my minimum.  Let me know what you think.

However, I'll make a very slight counteroffer, just to see if Alice will accept it.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
