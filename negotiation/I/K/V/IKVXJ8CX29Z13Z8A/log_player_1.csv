Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $900,000, which is a substantial compromise on my end. This offer stands as a testament to my belief in finding a mutually beneficial agreement."",

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to go higher. We're at his initial offer price, but we know he values the product at $1,000,000. There's still room to negotiate and aim for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  However, $800,000 is still a significant gap from what I had in mind. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the value this product brings."",

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we settle this right now at $850,000? This is my final offer, and I think it's a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 
* **Time pressure:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, so creating a sense of urgency is important.
* **Fair compromise:**  $850,000 is a strong price, well above our minimum and a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product.
* **Firmness:** By stating it's our final offer, we signal we're unwilling to go much lower, prompting Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are close. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $837,500. This is a very fair offer and shows I'm committed to getting this done today.

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $837,500 is a significant profit above our $800,000 minimum and a good compromise from our last ask.
* **Time Value:** We're running out of rounds, and while we could push for more, Bob might not be willing to budge much further.  A deal in hand is better than the uncertainty of continued negotiation. 
* **Relationship:** Accepting this offer shows Bob we are willing to compromise and value closing the deal. This could be beneficial for future interactions."
