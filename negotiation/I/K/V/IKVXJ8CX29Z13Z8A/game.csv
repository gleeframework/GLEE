"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $900,000, which is a substantial compromise on my end. This offer stands as a testament to my belief in finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting closer.  However, $800,000 is still a significant gap from what I had in mind. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",875000.0,Alice,5,
