"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1000000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in this product,  $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it, given its potential value to me. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $800000 is unfortunately below my minimum threshold for selling this product.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1150000? This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1150000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to go up to $950000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and $950000 is closer to what I'm looking for. However, I still need to be a bit higher to justify selling. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $1050000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a good compromise for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
