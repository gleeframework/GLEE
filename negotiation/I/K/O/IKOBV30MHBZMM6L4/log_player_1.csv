{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so $1,000,000 is a fair starting point that gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $1,000,000 is above your minimum of $1,200,000, leaving you room to negotiate down if Bob counters.
* **It shows a willingness to compromise:**  This offer indicates that you're open to negotiation and not simply trying to extract the maximum price. 

By starting with this offer, you establish a negotiation framework that allows for both parties to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is good, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While you could potentially negotiate upwards, the risk of him rejecting further counteroffers is high.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed outcome, and offers a much better return than accepting Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below what I need to accept.  Considering the value you see in the product, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer moves from your initial $1,000,000 to $900,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Appealing to value:** Highlighting the value Bob sees in the product (while acknowledging his budget constraint) reinforces the potential benefit for him.
* **Fairness:** Framing the offer as ""fair"" can help shift the negotiation focus from pure price to a mutually beneficial agreement. 

This counteroffer presents a compromise while still maintaining a price point that is significantly higher than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is still far below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's closer than his previous offer, it's still too risky to accept.  The potential for further negotiation with Bob is uncertain, and selling to John guarantees you a significantly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet at $850,000? This is a fair compromise that acknowledges both our needs. Let's try to reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle (sort of):** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's current offer of $750,000.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** The message stresses the ""fair compromise"" aspect, aiming to create a sense of cooperation rather than just haggling.
* **Reinforcing mutual benefit:** The message highlights that reaching an agreement would ""benefit both of us,"" emphasizing the shared goal.

This counteroffer is a final attempt to close the gap and potentially reach a deal with Bob, while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price. However, if Bob rejects this offer, you are prepared to sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
