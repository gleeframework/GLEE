"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product, which is a valuable addition to any collection. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000, a price that I believe is a fair compromise given its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still significantly more than your budget of $800,000 and what John is offering.  You can save a substantial amount of money ($400,000) by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
