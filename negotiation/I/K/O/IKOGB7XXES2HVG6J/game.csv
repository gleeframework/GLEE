"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is quite a way from my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This reflects the product's true value.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's try $9,500. It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,750.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I hear you about the other buyer, but $10,750 is still a bit much.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800.  That's a significant step closer to your offer, and it allows us to both walk away with a good deal. ",9800.0,Bob,6,
