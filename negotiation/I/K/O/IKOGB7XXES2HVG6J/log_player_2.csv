"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's budget of $8,000.  It makes sense to reject and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** This counteroffer sets a firm lower bound, starting the negotiation well within Bob's budget. 
* **Reasonable increase:**  A $500 increase from John's offer shows willingness to compromise while still leaving room for potential further negotiation.
* **Friendly tone:** The message maintains a positive and open communication style to encourage a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is quite a way from my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a step in the right direction, it's still far too high for Bob.  Rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations will allow Bob to try and get the price closer to his target.  The goal is to secure a price as close to $8,000 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's try $9,500. It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental change:** A $2,000 drop from Alice's offer shows a significant move towards her bottom line, while still keeping the price within a reasonable range for Bob.
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the ""fair compromise"" aspect, making it less about a one-sided concession and more about finding common ground. 
* **Reiterating interest:**  The message reinforces Bob's continued interest in the product, keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,750.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** Even though Alice has lowered her price, $10,750 is still above Bob's preferred budget.
* **Potential for better deal:** Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob the opportunity to potentially get a lower price or consider buying from John.
* **""Final offer"" pressure:** While Alice mentions another buyer, Bob shouldn't feel pressured.  He can still try to negotiate a lower price or simply buy from John if he's not comfortable with this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I hear you about the other buyer, but $10,750 is still a bit much.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800.  That's a significant step closer to your offer, and it allows us to both walk away with a good deal. "", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying within his preferred budget range. This suggests a sincere desire to reach a deal.
* **""Good Deal"" Framing:** Emphasizing a ""good deal"" for both parties softens the negotiation and avoids making it seem like a purely one-sided concession.
* **Time Pressure:** While acknowledging Alice's ""final offer,"" Bob doesn't succumb to pressure.  He's making a counteroffer, showing that he's still in control of the negotiation."
