"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I understand it's worth the same to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to avoid selling it to John for the same amount. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
