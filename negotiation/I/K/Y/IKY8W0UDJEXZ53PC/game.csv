"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $950000. I believe it's a fair offer considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a unique product, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll consider a price of $850000. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $820000 for the product. It's a fair price that I think reflects its value, and it's closer to what I was thinking.",820000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $820000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll consider a price of $840000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",840000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $820000 for the product, but I was thinking that if you're willing to meet me at $840000, you might be willing to meet me at $820000. Can you consider that price?",820000.0,Bob,6,
