"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe holds significant value for someone with your interests. While my minimum selling price is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth and gives us both a win. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than her initial asking price, it's still higher than what you can get from John.  You're better off saving $150,000 by going with John."
