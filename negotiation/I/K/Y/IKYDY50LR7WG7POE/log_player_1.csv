{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe holds significant value for someone with your interests. While my minimum selling price is $1,000,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its true worth and gives us both a win."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to your minimum ($1,000,000) maximizes your potential profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it significantly above this makes rejection likely.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The $950,000 offer provides a buffer for potential negotiation while still being a strong starting point.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Having John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net, making you less desperate to close with Bob. 
* **Confident Language:** The message conveys the product's value while also showing a willingness to make a deal."
