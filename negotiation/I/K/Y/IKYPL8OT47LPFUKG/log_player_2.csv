"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price from Alice. While $1,200,000 is still higher than Alice's value, it's worth negotiating further to see if you can lower the price even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above her value. It shows a willingness to negotiate while leaving room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings."
