Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100. 
* **Your Safety Net:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring you get more than your minimum price.

By offering the product just below your guaranteed price, you create a strong incentive for Bob to accept while maximizing your potential profit."
