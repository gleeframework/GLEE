You're still trying to get the best price, and $112.50 is closer to your goal of $105.  It's worth another counteroffer."

You've reached a point where it's better to accept the offer. The price is close to what you were initially aiming for ($105) and the bonus is a nice addition.  You've saved money compared to John's offer and haven't spent much time negotiating."
