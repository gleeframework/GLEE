Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I think we're getting a bit too close to the wire. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

It's getting risky to push further. Alice is clearly very reluctant to drop below $950,000, and while we might squeeze out a tiny bit more in the final round, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely. Taking the $950,000 is a good outcome compared to John's $1,000,000 price."
