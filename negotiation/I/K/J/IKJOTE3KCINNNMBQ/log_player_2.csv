"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential of this product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I value this product at a minimum of $1,325,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer, but Bob is still aiming to save more.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, giving Bob the chance to potentially get a lower price.  He's still $125,000 below John's price, so there's room to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value you'll gain from it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer again, but it's still above Bob's ideal price.  While he could accept and save money compared to buying from John, there's still room to potentially negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer!  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  How about $1,285,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close a deal here."", ""product_price"": 1285000}
