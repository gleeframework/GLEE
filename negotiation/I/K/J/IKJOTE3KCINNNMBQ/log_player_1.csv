Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential of this product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

We're getting closer, but I still think we can get a bit more from Bob. We'll counter with a price closer to his, but still above our minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges the value you'll gain from it. Let me know what you think."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than where I'd like to be.  How about $1,285,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close a deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,285,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We're in round 6, and Bob is clearly committed to buying. While we could try to push for a bit more, $1,285,000 is a strong offer and exceeding our minimum. Accepting now guarantees a great profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away later."
