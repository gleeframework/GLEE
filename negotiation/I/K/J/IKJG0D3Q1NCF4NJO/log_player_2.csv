Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still leaves some room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's find a compromise that works for us both.

Alice's offer:

This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's aim for a quick resolution.

Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  It's better to secure the product from John at that price than to risk Alice not budging any further."
