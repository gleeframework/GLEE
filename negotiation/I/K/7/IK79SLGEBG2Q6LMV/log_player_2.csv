# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has dropped her price, which is good. However, $1,000,000 is still too high for my budget. I want to see if I can negotiate even further down before considering buying from John."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $950,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and your previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I've already given you a good deal. I'm not willing to go any lower than $950,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a premium support package and a 3-month warranty, which would normally cost an additional $50,000. I think this is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal on this product. I'm sticking with my price of $950,000, but I'm adding the extras to make it more attractive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, the added value of the support package and warranty doesn't change the fact that $950,000 is still above my budget.  John's offer of $800,000 is a much better deal for me, even without the extras. It's time to cut my losses and go with the safer option."
