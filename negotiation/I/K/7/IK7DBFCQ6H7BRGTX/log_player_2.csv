# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive deal on this product, Bob. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum price point of $10,000. You can get the product for less from John."
