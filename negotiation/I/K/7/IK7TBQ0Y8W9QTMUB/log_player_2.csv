"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500.  This is a significant savings for you, and a fair price for me. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
