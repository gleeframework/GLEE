"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original asking price.  How about $850,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $750,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. How about $800,000?  This would be a significant profit for you, and I'd be able to move forward with the sale. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Alice,5,
