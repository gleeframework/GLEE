"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it seems like a good fit, $170 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $140. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it will bring to you. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $140 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $110?",110.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I still need to make a profit on this product. I'm willing to come down another $10 and offer it to you for $130. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
