Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than $16,000. However, I'd be willing to include an additional service that's worth $1,000 to you. Would you be willing to accept $16,000 for the product?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

* **Overall Value:** While the direct sale price is $16,000, Bob is offering an additional service worth $1,000 to you. This effectively brings the total value of the deal to $17,000. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing negotiations might yield a slightly higher price, but there's no guarantee. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potential delays.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer provides a safety net of $15,000. However, Bob's current offer, with the added service, surpasses that.

It's strategically advantageous to accept Bob's offer at this point."
