This offer starts the negotiation by aiming for a middle ground between your minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value.  It leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a substantial profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. How about $925,000?

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open, potentially allowing you to achieve a higher price or decide to sell to John if further negotiations don't yield a desirable outcome."
