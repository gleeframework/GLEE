Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $850,000 is significantly less than what I need to make this worthwhile, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,050,000. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value you place on the product.
