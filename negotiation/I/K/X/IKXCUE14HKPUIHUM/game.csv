"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. How about $7,100? I believe this is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can close this out.",7100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as high as $7,100. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $6,900. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal considering the value you'll get from this product.",6900.0,Alice,5,
