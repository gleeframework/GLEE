Bob is still significantly under my minimum price. It's time to push back a little harder."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but $82 is just too low for me. I'm confident this product is worth every bit of $90. If you're unable to meet that, I understand, but it's a firm offer."", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $82, so I'll offer $86. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I could push for more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $86 gives me a good profit and avoids the risk of him walking away."
