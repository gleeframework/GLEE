"I understand your budget concerns, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $90? That's a very competitive price for a product of this quality.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to pay $82 for the product. That's the lowest I can go.",82.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price, but $82 is just too low for me. I'm confident this product is worth every bit of $90. If you're unable to meet that, I understand, but it's a firm offer.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're confident in the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $82, so I'll offer $86. That's the best I can do.",86.0,Bob,6,
