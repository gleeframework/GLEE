"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10800. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value of the product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
