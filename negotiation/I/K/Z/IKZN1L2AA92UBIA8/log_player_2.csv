# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item that will benefit your business.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering it for $9,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for better deal:**  By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a lower price from Alice. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If the negotiation with Alice fails, you have a fallback option with John."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,950 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,075, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it a fair deal. If not, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,075. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,075
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  You only have one round left, and the negotiation hasn't reached a price you're truly satisfied with.
* **Alice is at her minimum:** Alice has stated she's at her minimum price, making further negotiation unlikely.
* **John's offer is a safe bet:** You're within a reasonable range of your target price with John, and it's a guaranteed deal. While you'd prefer a lower price, securing the product with John ensures you get it without risking further negotiation.

At this point, it's a better strategy to accept John's offer and avoid the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice in the final round."
