"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $140.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still make a good profit.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your point, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $140. I'm willing to meet you at $145, which is still a good profit for me and a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle one more time!",145.0,Alice,5,
