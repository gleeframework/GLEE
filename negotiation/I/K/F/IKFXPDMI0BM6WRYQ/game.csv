"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than that.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $125 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100? That's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
