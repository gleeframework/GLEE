"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $6,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,250. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. What do you say?",8250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced that $8,250 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $7,800, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",7800.0,Bob,6,
