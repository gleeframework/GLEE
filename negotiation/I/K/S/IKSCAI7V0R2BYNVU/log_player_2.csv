"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's value of $8,000. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  A counteroffer of $10,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial $12,000. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  $10,000 is still above Alice's value of $8,000, leaving room for a potential compromise. 
* **Politeness:** The message is friendly and respectful, which can help maintain a positive negotiation environment."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  $10000 is a bit lower than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $11000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, and $11,000 represents a good compromise.
* **Value vs. Cost:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are relatively small compared to the cost of buying from John at $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate, forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price."
