"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You are willing to pay up to $12,000, and John is selling it for that price.  While Alice's offer is appealing, you can get the same product for the same price from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer."
