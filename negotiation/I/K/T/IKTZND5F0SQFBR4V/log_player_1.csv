Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He'll only accept offers at or below this price.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  Any price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 is beneficial for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's appealing to Bob while maximizing your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be a bit bolder.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,400,000 is significantly below your minimum but still leaves a substantial profit margin for you.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even though John's offer is your safety net) creates a sense of urgency and competition.
* **Focus on Value:** Instead of just stating the price, highlight the ""unique value and potential"" to remind Bob of why he's interested.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your negotiation style and Bob's personality, you might adjust the offer and message accordingly."
