"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our product to you. Given its value to you, we believe it is worth $1,350,000. We are confident this price reflects the product's true worth and offers a fair transaction for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,200,000) but still within my budget. However, I'm aiming to save as much as possible. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $1,250,000. This price would still provide you a healthy profit margin and allow me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still above my target.  I'm going to continue to negotiate and see if I can get closer to my ideal price of $1,250,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to secure the product for $1,275,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire the product within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest proposal, Bob. After reviewing the situation, we are proposing a price of $1,290,000 for the product. This price reflects the value we place on the product while ensuring a reasonable profit margin for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now only $40,000 above my target price of $1,250,000. It's a reasonable compromise, and I'm within my budget.  While I could try for another counteroffer, there's a risk that Alice will either reject it or get frustrated, potentially leading to a deadlock. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product."
