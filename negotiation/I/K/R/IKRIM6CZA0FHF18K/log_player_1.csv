Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  However, that final offer is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $987,500. This is my final offer.

You have three options:

``` 

While it's below my ideal price, accepting Bob's offer at $987,500 makes the most sense at this point.  Here's why:

* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations further risks losing the deal entirely.  John's offer is secure.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The difference between Bob's current offer and my ""ideal"" is shrinking. Each additional round might only net a small increase.
* **Relationship:** Accepting Bob's ""final offer"" leaves a better taste than pushing further, potentially leading to smoother future interactions."
