"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! $120 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I think the product is worth more than $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110?  That feels like a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I think the product is worth more than $110. I'm willing to offer it to you for $112.50. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",112.5,Alice,5,
