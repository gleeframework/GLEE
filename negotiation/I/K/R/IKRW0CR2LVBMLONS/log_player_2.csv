Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can do $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but there's still room to negotiate.  Let's try to meet in the middle again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

```

While we could try to negotiate further, $115 is a reasonable price and a decent compromise. It avoids the risk of Alice walking away and forces us to buy from John at the higher price."
