"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's potential.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me, but also acknowledges the value it holds for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than you'd like to pay, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product to me, while also being more in line with your budget.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  We're getting closer to a deal, and this price reflects both the value of the product to me and my financial constraints. Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise considering the value it holds for you.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $975,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my last offer and reflects the value I see in it. Let's close this deal, I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a firm price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're interested, this is your last chance to make a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
