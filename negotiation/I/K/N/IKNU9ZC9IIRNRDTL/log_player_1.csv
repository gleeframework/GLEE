Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $2,300,000 is way above my budget. I could consider a price closer to $800,000. Let me know if that works for you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for working with me.  While $1,550,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  My absolute best offer is $1,300,000. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:

Reason: Bob is unlikely to move significantly above $1,300,000. Selling to John guarantees the maximum value of $1,500,000 and avoids further negotiation."
