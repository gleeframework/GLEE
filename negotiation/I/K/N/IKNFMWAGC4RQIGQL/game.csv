"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm! I'm happy to consider it, but $12,000 is a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to pay $11,000. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $11,250, which is closer to my initial counteroffer.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go down to $11,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11,375. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",11375.0,Alice,5,
