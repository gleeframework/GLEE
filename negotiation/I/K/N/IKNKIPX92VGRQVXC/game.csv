"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is quite interesting, that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I have to make a living, and I need to make a profit. I can see that you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly settle somewhere around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit short on budget, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I can see the value of the product is clear to you, and I'm willing to meet you at $800,000. This is the minimum I can go, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen.",800000.0,Alice,5,
