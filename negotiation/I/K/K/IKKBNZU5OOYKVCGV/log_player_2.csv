"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is your maximum, there's no reason to jump at the first offer.  Rejecting allows you to potentially get a better price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and allows for room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to gauge Alice's willingness to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my acceptable range. Accepting this offer saves me $10 compared to buying from John.  There's a chance I might get a lower price later, but the risk of losing the deal isn't worth it."
