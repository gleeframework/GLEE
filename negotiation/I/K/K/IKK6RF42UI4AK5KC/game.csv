"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $160 for the product.  This price is still above what it's worth to me, but it reflects a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",160.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to consider a price of $170 for the product. This offer still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being competitive with your offer. I hope this proposal will be more agreeable to you.",170.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a little more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $165? This would give you a profit margin and still allow me to get the product for a price I'm happy with.  Let's make this deal!",165.0,Bob,4,
