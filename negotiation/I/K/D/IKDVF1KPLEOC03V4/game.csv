"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice, but the price is a little high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000 at this time.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
