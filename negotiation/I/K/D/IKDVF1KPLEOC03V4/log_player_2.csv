Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to you and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, the price of $1,025,000 is still higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will get her below John's price, and it's not worth the risk of her raising her price again.  It's time to cut your losses and take the guaranteed deal with John."
