Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm asking for $11,500. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Since the product is worth $12,000 to Bob, there's room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **Leave Negotiation Space:**  Starting with $11,500 allows some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still ensuring a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John provides a safety net. It allows you to be more confident in your negotiation with Bob."
