"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity.  While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. This still allows us to share the value it brings, while being closer to your original offer. I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,
