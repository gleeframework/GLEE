"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first. $11,000 is still too high, and there's a chance you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm offering $9,000, which is still a good deal for Alice since it's more than her minimum value. This is a good starting point for negotiation and shows I'm serious about buying but also want a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my desired price point. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
I'm increasing my offer to $9,500. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise and come closer to her price, but it still leaves room for negotiation."
