"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product of exceptional value. Given its unique benefits, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's within my budget, I want to see if I can negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the value you've placed on the product, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within my budget and leaves some room for negotiation. This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value this product brings is truly significant. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is a good compromise. While I'd prefer a lower price,  I'm getting closer to my goal of saving money, and buying from John would cost me even more.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product within my budget and keeps me from potentially getting stuck with a worse deal."
