# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can come to a more reasonable price. I am willing to pay $7,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to close the deal, $7,500 is too low for me. I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm happy to come down a bit, but how about $8,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I still feel that $8,000 would be a fair price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is exactly what the product is worth to me. I don't want to risk losing the deal and only getting $8,000 from John, so I'll accept Bob's offer."
