"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming high to establish a strong negotiating position. Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, this offer leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.
* **Confident & Positive Tone:** We want to create a collaborative atmosphere and convey the value of the product without being overly aggressive. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, we give ourselves space to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early stages of negotiation. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to pay more than our minimum, and we have room to maneuver.  We'll try to steer him closer to our initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable figure,  the true value of this product, in terms of its potential and uniqueness, is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Slightly:** We're showing flexibility by reducing our price, but not by a large amount. This demonstrates our willingness to negotiate while still holding firm on the product's value.
* **Emphasize Value:** We're reiterating the product's unique value proposition to justify the higher price point.
* **Seeking a Compromise:**  By positioning this counteroffer as a ""fair compromise,"" we're encouraging Bob to meet us closer to our desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating in smaller increments, indicating he's getting closer to his limit. However, we're still a significant amount away from our desired price. We'll hold firm and see if he's willing to budge further. The risk of him walking away is increasing, but the potential reward for securing a higher price outweighs settling for $1,225,000 at this stage."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe we're undervaluing the potential this product holds.  To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're making a smaller concession this time, signaling that we're reaching our bottom line.  
* **Final Offer:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Justification:** We're reiterating the product's value proposition to justify the price, even though we've lowered it.
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're aiming for a price that's significantly higher than our guaranteed sale to John, while still leaving some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,300,000. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has countered our ""final offer"" by meeting us almost exactly in the middle. This suggests he's serious about closing the deal and is unlikely to go much higher. 
* **Strong Profit:** $1,275,000 is a significant profit margin above our minimum sale price to John.
* **Risk Assessment:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
