"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable figure,  the true value of this product, in terms of its potential and uniqueness, is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. I believe this price point reflects a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe we're undervaluing the potential this product holds.  To move this forward, I'm willing to accept $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
