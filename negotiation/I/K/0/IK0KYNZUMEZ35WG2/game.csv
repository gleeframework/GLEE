"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,500,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I value your interest, $1,000,000 is quite a bit below my minimum.  Could you consider $1,350,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide a great return on your investment.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still very interested in your product, but I'm sticking to my budget.  I can offer $1,150,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence. I see we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,250,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the true value of what I'm offering.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and it's the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
