"Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with an exclusive opportunity. I have a unique product that I believe would greatly benefit you, and I think it's worth more than its face value. Given its significance to me, I'm considering selling it to you at a special price. Would you be interested in discussing this further? Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $9,500. This offers a slight premium over its intrinsic worth to you, while still being a favorable deal for me. Let's make this a win-win situation.",9500.0,Alice,1,
