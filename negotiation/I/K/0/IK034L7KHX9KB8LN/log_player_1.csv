Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,100,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I truly believe in its value and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile acquisition for you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Minimum:** Your minimum acceptable price is $800,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** To maximize your profit, you want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without going over. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit for you.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob (who values the product more) and ensuring you receive a price significantly higher than your minimum acceptable offer from John."
