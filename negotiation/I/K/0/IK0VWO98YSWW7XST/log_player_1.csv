Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

This offer is a strategic starting point. It's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) but leaves room for negotiation.  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's potential for us to find a price that benefits both of us. 

Here's why I chose this specific offer:

* **Reasonable starting point:** $11,500 is not too aggressive, giving Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **Potential for profit:** If Bob accepts, I make a decent profit.
* **Option to counter-offer:** If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer to try and find a mutually agreeable price.

I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup option (selling to John for $10,000). This gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, I'm not willing to settle for it yet. There is still room for negotiation, and I believe I can get a better price.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price of $11,500. By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and show him that I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the true value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $11,500 and is still higher than Bob's current offer of $10,500.

Here's why I chose this amount:

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This offer is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price that benefits me.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  This counteroffer still leaves room for Bob to counter again if he wants. 

I'm hoping this offer will convince Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
