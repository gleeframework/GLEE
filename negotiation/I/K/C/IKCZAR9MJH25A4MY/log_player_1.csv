"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but leaving some room for negotiation. This allows me to explore the possibility of getting a price closer to $12,000 while still leaving room for concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reducing my offer slightly from the initial $11,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's current offer.  I believe this price remains attractive to Bob, given his valuation of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer, and we're now getting closer to a deal. While I would prefer to get closer to $10,000,  accepting this offer guarantees a sale that's considerably higher than selling to John. I'm also approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, so accepting this offer minimizes the risk of not reaching a deal at all."
