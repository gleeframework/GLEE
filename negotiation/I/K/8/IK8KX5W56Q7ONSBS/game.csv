"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However,  $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down a little.  However,  $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we won't be able to reach an agreement, Bob. However, I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,150,000 is too high, but I can do $1,130,000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1130000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,130,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and close this deal at $1,120,000.  I'm confident this will be mutually beneficial and we can finalize the deal.",1120000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the bottom of the barrel. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,125,000 is too high, but I can do $1,122,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price.",1122500.0,Alice,9,
