"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true value and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** I'm framing the high price with a focus on the product's ""unique potential"" and ""benefits."" This emphasizes value over a purely numerical argument.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While I want to maximize profit with Bob, I always have John as a backup option. This knowledge allows me to negotiate from a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  To be fair, I can offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a good starting point for a potential deal, considering the value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While he's showing willingness to negotiate, accepting now would mean a substantial loss. I'll counter in the next round to guide the negotiation towards a more agreeable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the product's true value significantly exceeds your current offer.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's inherent worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a substantial drop from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. However, the new price is still comfortably above both his offer and my minimum.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's value to justify the still-high price. This reinforces its worth in Bob's mind and sets a firm baseline for further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** By making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation active and signal my continued interest in reaching a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is getting closer to a reasonable price.  However,  $1,150,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This represents a good middle ground, and I'm confident that we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close, but $950,000 is still under my $1,000,000 minimum.  Bob is clearly engaged and negotiating in good faith. I believe I can still nudge him closer to my target with a carefully calculated counteroffer. Selling to John is a tempting safety net, but I'll risk another round to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,050,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm setting a firm price this round to signal that I'm nearing my bottom line. However, the $1,050,000 offer still provides a buffer above my absolute minimum, allowing me to maximize potential profit.
* **Framing as Win-Win:**  I'm highlighting the compromise I'm making while still emphasizing the value Bob receives. This encourages him to see the offer as mutually beneficial and encourages a final decision. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're over halfway through the rounds. By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm introducing a sense of urgency, making Bob weigh the deal against potentially missing out."
