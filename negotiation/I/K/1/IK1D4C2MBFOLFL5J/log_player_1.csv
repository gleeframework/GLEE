Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is still very favorable to Bob, but also gives me room to negotiate if he counters. I'm aiming to get as close to $10,000 as possible without risking him walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500.  It's a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to you.  Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,500 is a bit too low. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
