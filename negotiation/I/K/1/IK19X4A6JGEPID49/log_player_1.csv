"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($200) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm emphasizing that I'm open to negotiation to encourage Bob to engage and make a counteroffer. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive tone to create a friendly and welcoming environment for negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** My minimum value for the product is $150.  Bob's offer is at my minimum, which means I'm not losing money, but I'm also not gaining anything.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob. He expressed interest, but I need to see if he's willing to go higher. 
* **Remaining Rounds:**  I have 9 rounds left, giving me time to negotiate further. 

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $150 is my minimum, but I'm willing to come up a bit. How about $175?  It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's higher than Bob's offer but still below my initial asking price.  This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product by saying it's ""still a good deal"" for both of us.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging continued negotiation. 

**Next Steps:** I'll closely monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $175. Would you be willing to go down to $160? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price.
* **Room for Improvement:** I'm still confident that I can get a slightly higher price from Bob. 
* **Remaining Rounds:** I still have several rounds remaining to continue negotiating.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob again, aiming for a price closer to $170. I want to find a compromise that feels fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $165? That way we can both be happy with the price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 165}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price that's right in the middle between my previous counteroffer ($175) and Bob's latest offer ($160).
* **Emphasize Compromise:** I'm focusing on the idea of finding a compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is direct and easy to understand.

**Next Steps:** I'll watch Bob's response carefully and see if he's willing to accept this offer. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to adjust my price again or move closer to accepting his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your offer, but I'd still like to try to get a better deal. Would you be willing to go down to $155? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price of $150.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're nearing the end of the negotiation process, and I don't want to risk losing a sale entirely.
* **Slight Gain:**  While it's not a huge profit, accepting his offer still brings me a small gain over my minimum value.

**Next Steps:**  While I'm not thrilled with this price, it's a reasonable outcome given the circumstances. I've successfully negotiated a price higher than John's offer, so I'm satisfied with the deal."
