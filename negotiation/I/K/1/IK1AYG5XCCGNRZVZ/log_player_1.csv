"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it could really benefit you. Given its value, I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 
ðŸ˜Š 
Let's see how Bob responds! I started high, aiming to get a sense of his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only pay up to $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is a significant jump from my initial ask, but it's still below its worth to him. I'll counter to see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?"", ""product_price"": 10250} 

I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my initial ask while still acknowledging Bob's counteroffer. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given this some thought, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I believe $9,750 would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we still have some room to negotiate. I'm not ready to settle just yet. Let's see if I can nudge him a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,750 is close, but I'm aiming for something closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to meet at $9,900?"", ""product_price"": 9900} 

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer but holding firm on that $10,000 mark. This will show I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of a fair deal."
