# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this unique product for a price of $1,250,000.  This represents a significant value for you, as it's well below its worth to me.  While I'm confident in its value, I understand this may be a substantial investment, so please consider it carefully.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay my asking price.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
