"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $800,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely get it lower. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and a backup option with John, so there's no rush to accept right away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This is a very good price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still too high. Bob should continue negotiating and see if he can get Alice to lower her price further. There are still 7 rounds left, and he has the option of buying from John, so he's in a good position to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is still a bit below your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $850,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a good price, Bob is still aiming to save more. He has 5 rounds left and the backup option of buying from John. He should continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price. There's still room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $825,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $825,000 is still a bit below your target price. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $825,500. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a good deal for Bob!  Alice has come down significantly and is now only $500 away from his counteroffer.  With only 3 rounds remaining, and the chance to buy from John for a much higher price, Bob should accept this offer.  There's little chance of getting it much lower, and it's a significant savings over John's price."
