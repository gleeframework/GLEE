Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still reflects the significant value this product holds.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still quite a bit below my desired price. Given the significant value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,000,000 is still significantly less than what this product is worth. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to benefit.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
