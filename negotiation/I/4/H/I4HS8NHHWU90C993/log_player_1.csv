Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,000. This gives him a slight discount from what it's worth to him, while still allowing me to make a profit. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that significantly undervalues the product. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is still a good price for me and hopefully more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price.  John is a guaranteed sale at a price that is fair to me."
