Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  This gives me a strong starting point, and it's important to remember that I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay this amount. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I want. I'm going to reject his offer and counteroffer.  I have the fallback option of John, and I want to see if I can push Bob further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is still significantly more than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to compromise slightly while still protecting my interests.  It's also closer to my minimum, which is $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to take such a large loss. It's getting closer, but I'm going to reject his offer again and try to push for a higher price. The potential for a sale with John is too valuable to give up on just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $925,000. This is a further compromise, showing flexibility, but still keeps the price above Bob's last offer. I want to see if this might be a compromise he's willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, it's still below my minimum.  I've shown willingness to negotiate, but I'm concerned we're getting into a stalemate.  Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation and potentially losing time and a sale, I'm going to choose to sell to John for $1,000,000. This guarantees my minimum price and ensures a quick and easy sale."
