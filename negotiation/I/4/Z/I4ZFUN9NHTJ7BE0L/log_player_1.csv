Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a competitive price of $150. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I have a guaranteed offer from John for $120, which is my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a better outcome.  It's in my best interest to take the sure thing."
