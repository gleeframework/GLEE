"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $16,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $15,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
