Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and while my asking price is $1,450,000, I'm open to discussing a figure that works best for both of us. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting with $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value. This gives you the best chance of securing a higher price.
* **Open Communication:**  The message invites Bob to share his thoughts and potentially counter-offer, fostering a collaborative negotiation."
