"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for your product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,550,000. This is a fair price that's within my budget, and I'm confident this product will be a good investment. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
