"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its immense potential and your keen interest, I propose a starting price of $950,000.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit hesitant to go as high as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can derive from it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $925,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $925,000 is the right price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $885,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can derive from it.",885000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your perspective on the price, and I want to make this deal happen. I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000.  This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute lowest I can go while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $890,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can derive from it.",890000.0,Bob,6,
