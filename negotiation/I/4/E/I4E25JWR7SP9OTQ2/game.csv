"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider  $650,000. I believe that's a fair offer reflecting its worth to me.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be completely transparent, my budget limit for this purchase is closer to $700,000.  Would you be willing to consider $720,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",720000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $720,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value I believe the product holds. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
