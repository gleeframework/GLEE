**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer is getting too close to John's standing offer. It's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer.  At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob and potentially getting a lower offer outweighs the potential gain of $50,000. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
