Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in your product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's above my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $13,250 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer.  $13,000 is a good price, and it's getting close to my target.  I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
