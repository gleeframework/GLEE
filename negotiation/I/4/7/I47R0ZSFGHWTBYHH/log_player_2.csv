"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is close to my limit, I should try to negotiate a better price from Alice first.  There's a chance she might go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm aiming low to maximize potential savings. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:**  I want to maintain a positive tone to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Not Too Low:**  Offering $90 is a significant decrease, but it's not ridiculously low. It might be tempting enough for Alice if she's motivated to sell."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concern, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about I sell it to you for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice met my alternative price. It's the same price I can get from John, and there's no guarantee I could get it lower. It's a fair deal!"
