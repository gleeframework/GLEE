I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm offering a price in the middle of my minimum and Bob's last offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same amount and I'd rather close the deal."
