"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product and I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can meet you halfway at $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $97? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $97 is quite fair, considering the product's value to me. I can do $102, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a good deal for both of us, don't you think?",102.0,Alice,5,
