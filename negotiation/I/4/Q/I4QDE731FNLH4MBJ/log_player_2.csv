"Round 1

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in discussing a price closer to $650,000.  Let me know if that's a possibility."", ""product_price"": 650000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the inherent value of the product.  While $650,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $975,000? This reflects the product's worth while still providing you with significant value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  While I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, $975,000 is still a bit high for me.  I can go up to $725,000.  This offer reflects a fair price for both of us, I believe.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 725000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $725,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm on a price well above your limit. Her ""final offer"" suggests she's not going to budge much further. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John at $800,000."
