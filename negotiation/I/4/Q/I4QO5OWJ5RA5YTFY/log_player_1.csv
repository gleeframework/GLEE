Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum.  This leaves room for negotiation and potential for both of us to reach a deal that is mutually beneficial. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize potential profit:**  A $10,000 price point is significantly better than selling to John for $12,000,  allowing me to potentially capture more value.
* **Negotiation room:**  This price leaves space for Bob to counteroffer without making me feel like I'm giving away too much. 
* **Attractive offer:** This price is still attractive to Bob, as he values the product at $8,000. He may be willing to pay a bit more to secure the product.

I'm confident that starting the negotiation with this offer will put me in a strong position to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John for $12,000, I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired $10,000 or even higher.
* **Motivating Bob:** By rejecting his offer, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price and  potentially pushing him to make a higher counteroffer.
* **Time is on my side:** As the negotiations continue, Bob may be willing to increase his offer as he realizes the value of the product and the risk of losing it.

I'm confident that by rejecting this offer, I can  secure a better deal that will  get me closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still below my initial offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By not accepting his offer immediately, I'm showing that I'm still in control and not desperate to sell.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay closer to my desired price.

I'm confident that this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation and a final price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer to sell the product for $9,200.

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:**  $9,200 is very close to my initial counteroffer of $9,500 and significantly better than selling to John for $12,000.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate may lead to a lower price or a longer process.
* **Minimizing risk:**  There's always a risk that Bob may walk away, and I might end up with a worse outcome. 

Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal entirely and allows me to secure a reasonable profit."
