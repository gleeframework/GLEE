"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value, but it's also reasonable considering the product's value to Bob.  I'm hoping to maximize my profits, but I also want to keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to accept that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a more agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $8,500.  This is a good compromise as it's in the middle of my initial offer and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, he'll see that this is a fair price for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value for the product. It's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  I'll accept his offer."
