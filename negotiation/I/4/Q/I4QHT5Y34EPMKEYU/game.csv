"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?  I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This price still offers you a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good investment.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  Let me know if that works for you.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and $7,500 is closer to where I want to be. How about we split the difference and go with $8,000? I'm confident this price still provides excellent value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
