Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below your minimum ($120) allows for the possibility of Bob negotiating down slightly, still landing you a better price than John. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
