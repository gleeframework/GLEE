"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me while giving you a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,350,000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value to me.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again and offer $1,300,000. This would still be a good deal for both of us, and I believe we can close this deal quickly.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product for $1,325,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,325,000 is closer to my target, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,310,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  Otherwise, I'll need to consider other options.",1310000.0,Bob,6,
