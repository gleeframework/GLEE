"Alice, $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to what the product is worth to me.  Let's start with $750,000 and see where we can go from there.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming to save more.  How about we split the difference and go with $800,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and would let us close the deal quickly.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $825,000 is getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. Let's meet in the middle again and settle on $812,500.  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal right now.",812500.0,Bob,6,
