Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $170. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation isn't possible in a real negotiation:**  In a real-world scenario, you wouldn't know Bob values the product at $80. Your goal is to maximize your profit with the information you have.
* **Starting high:** It's generally a good strategy to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Aiming above John's offer:** Since John is willing to pay $150, starting with an offer of $170 to Bob allows you to potentially earn even more. If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on selling to John. 
 
This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
