Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $75?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $75, I know the product is worth at least $80 to me. I want to see if I can get closer to that value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell it for $77.50."", ""product_price"": 77.50}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's still slightly below my minimum, it's a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
