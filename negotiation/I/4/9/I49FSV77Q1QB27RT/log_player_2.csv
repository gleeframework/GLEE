"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it can be a valuable asset for your business as well.  My initial offer is $2,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is far too high.  It's well above my maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows me to start negotiating a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price reflects the value of the product while giving you room to make a profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,400,000 is still much higher than my budget. It's important to stay firm on my maximum price and continue negotiating. Rejecting the offer allows me to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's try $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the potential benefits for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget.  I'll continue to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not willing to give up on getting the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  $1,000,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while allowing you to make a strong return on your investment.  Let's finalize this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than my budget of $800,000. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and the risk of not closing a deal is increasing.  At this point, it's better to secure the product from John for a guaranteed price of $800,000 rather than risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially miss out on the product altogether."
