"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far too high for me.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is significantly lower.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if we can get closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $800,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price reflects the value of the product while giving you room to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $800,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll bring to the product.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I appreciate his persistence, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I still believe there's potential for a deal that benefits both of us, but I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product. I'm prepared to make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's try $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the potential benefits for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway,  how about $1,000,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. I still believe we can find a deal that benefits both of us. I'm prepared to make another counteroffer in the next round, hoping to close the deal without having to sell to John."
