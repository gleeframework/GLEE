{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is very close to my maximum budget, but I can likely get a better price by negotiating. I'm going to reject the offer and see if I can push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by almost 100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and gives me room to negotiate further. I'm hoping she'll counter with something closer to my target price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I'd like, but it's getting closer to my target price. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. I believe I can still push for a lower price, especially since I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if necessary."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $925,000. I've shown a willingness to compromise, and I believe I can still squeeze out a slightly better deal.  I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to make a small counteroffer, just $10,000 less than Alice's last offer.  This shows that I'm still serious about negotiating but am willing to meet her halfway.  I'm hoping that with a few rounds left, Alice will be motivated to make a deal at this price point."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $5,000 higher than my last counteroffer.  While I'd prefer a lower price, I'm running out of time. With only three rounds left, I'm concerned that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or even force me to buy from John at a much higher price.  It's time to accept and secure the deal."
