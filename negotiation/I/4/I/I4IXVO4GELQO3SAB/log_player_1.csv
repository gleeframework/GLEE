Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $18,000 is too low for me to consider.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation risk."
