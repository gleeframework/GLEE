Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer
