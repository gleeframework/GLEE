Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to you, the message subtly implies it's significant by mentioning ""its value."" 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially counter-offer if he finds the price too high.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a chance to purchase a product he values. If Bob rejects the offer, you have the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase at your minimum acceptable price."
