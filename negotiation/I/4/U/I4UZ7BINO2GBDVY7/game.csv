"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that 12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of 11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $9000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering another seller.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to negotiate, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer 10250. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options.",10250.0,Alice,5,
