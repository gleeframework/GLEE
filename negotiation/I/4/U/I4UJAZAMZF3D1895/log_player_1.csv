"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it's worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not making it seem like this is my final offer, leaving the door open for counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:**  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.
* **Exploring Options:**  While selling to John for $10,000 is a safe option, I want to see if I can secure a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low. How about we split the difference and settle for $10,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking to my minimum price of $10,000 but using a friendly tone to avoid antagonizing Bob.
* **Compromise:** Offering to ""split the difference"" implies a willingness to negotiate, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Reiterating the value of the product helps justify the price."
