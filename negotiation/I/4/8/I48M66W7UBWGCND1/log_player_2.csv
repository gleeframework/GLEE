"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
 
Alice's starting offer is too high. While we could accept John's offer right now, there's a good chance we can negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $1,100,000."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:** We start with a significant counter-offer, aiming to bring Alice closer to her product's actual value. This leaves room for further negotiation while still showing we're serious buyers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to offer the product at $1,250,000.  This price is still fair given the value the product holds for you.  Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice moved closer to a reasonable price, $1,250,000 is still significantly above her product's value. We have room to negotiate further without risking John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but the gap between our valuations is still significant. I could consider a price closer to $1,150,000. "", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:** We're nudging our offer up slightly to show willingness to compromise but remain firm on staying below $1,200,000. This keeps the pressure on Alice while acknowledging her concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,200,000. This is a substantial offer, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's worth to you.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to a price we'd accept, but we're not in a hurry. We have five rounds left, and she's shown a willingness to negotiate.  There's still room to try for a slightly better deal before considering her $1,200,000 or John's $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're almost there. To be honest,  $1,175,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you, and we can close this out."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

**Reasoning:** We're splitting the difference again in this round,  showing we're willing to compromise but holding a firm line. This offer is very close to her $1,200,000, making it more likely she'll accept. If she rejects it, we'll need to seriously consider accepting her offer in the next round or going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but I'm still not quite there. To show you my willingness to compromise, I'm prepared to offer the product at $1,190,000.  This is a final price, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the value we've both agreed on.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:** This is a good deal! We've managed to negotiate the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer.  While we could try to push for a slightly lower amount, there's a risk Alice will hold firm, and we'd be left with John's less favorable offer. Accepting now secures a significant saving."
