"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and it's a price that still allows me to recoup my investment.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $950,000, but I'm still needing to secure a price closer to $1,000,000. How about we split the difference and I accept $975,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $900,000, so I'm offering $925,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",925000.0,Bob,6,
