Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This price is fair, considering the value you've placed on it and my own budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
