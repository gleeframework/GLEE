Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's in great condition and worth a lot more to the right person. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$120 is a good starting point:** It's above your minimum acceptable price of $80 and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message is friendly and open:** It creates a positive atmosphere for negotiation and hints at the product's value.

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and leaves space for him to counter-offer. If he accepts, I get a decent profit. If he rejects, we can start the negotiation process and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still too low for me to consider.
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob is interested in the product, so there's an opportunity to increase his offer.
* **Selling to John is not the best option:** While $80 is guaranteed, I can potentially get more from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low, I'm willing to come down to $105. It's still a good deal for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is within a reasonable range:** I'm reducing my price from $120 to $105, which is a significant concession but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message is positive and encourages negotiation:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and express willingness to compromise, while also highlighting the potential benefits for both parties.
* **$105 is a fair compromise:**  It's closer to Bob's offer, but it also allows me to get a decent profit and potentially avoid having to sell to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  While I prefer a higher price, $95 is only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Further negotiation may be unproductive:** Bob has consistently lowered his offers, suggesting he might not be willing to go higher.  
* **Risk of selling to John:**  There's a risk that if I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away, and I would be forced to sell to John for a significantly lower price.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that is close to my minimum and avoids the potential loss of selling to John."
