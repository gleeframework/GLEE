"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, you can potentially get it for even less.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible. However,  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're still trying to save as much money as possible.  $11,500 is closer to your goal, but you can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Let's see if you can get Alice down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $11,500 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a little tight.  How about $11,000?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think $11,250 is the lowest I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still within your budget, but you can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  $11,250 is closer to your goal of $10,000, so it's worth trying to get her down just a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know you're serious about buying the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,150. This is my final offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has made her final offer, and while it's still a bit higher than your ideal price, it's within your budget and getting closer to John's price. It's risky to continue negotiating, as you might end up with nothing.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product and keeps some room for negotiation in the future."
