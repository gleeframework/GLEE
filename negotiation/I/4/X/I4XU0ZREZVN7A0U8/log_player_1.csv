"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $2,000,000. I'm confident that you'll recognize its worth."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and John's offer creates room for negotiation and anchors the price high in Bob's mind.
* **Confident tone:** Projecting confidence about the product's value can influence Bob's perception and willingness to pay.
* **Leaving John as a backup:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's potential to earn more from Bob if the negotiation is successful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is quite high. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below both my minimum and John's offer.  Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows me to guide him towards a more agreeable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,750,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** Countering shows willingness to negotiate and moves the price closer to Bob's range.
* **Strategic concession:**  Meeting ""halfway"" sounds significant while still keeping the price well above Bob's offer and John's guaranteed price. 
* **Maintain a strong position:** The tone remains firm, emphasizing the product's value and setting a higher anchor for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000. This allows for a reasonable profit for you while remaining within my financial constraints.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing more willingness to move, his offer is still below John's guaranteed $1,500,000. We're getting closer to a potential deal, but I need to push him further to maximize my profit. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering its unique value."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating urgency:**  Phrases like ""Let's make this happen"" introduce a subtle sense of urgency to the negotiation.
* **Smaller concession:** The decrease from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000 is smaller than the previous round, signaling I'm reaching my lower limit. 
* **Reiterating value:** Reminding Bob about the ""unique value"" reinforces the justification for the price. 

I'm getting closer to John's offer but believe there's still room for Bob to increase his bid."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your efforts, $1,600,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This price is fair, considering both our needs, and would make this deal a win-win for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offers too slowly. He went up only $50,000 from his previous offer. At this rate, it's unlikely he'll reach a price significantly higher than John's $1,500,000 offer within the remaining rounds.  

It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer to maximize my profit and avoid the risk of Bob not meeting my expectations."
