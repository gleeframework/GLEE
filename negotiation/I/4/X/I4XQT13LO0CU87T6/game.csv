"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to invest a bit less at this time. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This offer still represents a strong value for you, and I'm confident it's a price that would benefit both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,150,000. This price still represents a significant discount for you, but also reflects the product's worth to me.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,200,000, which is the same price I initially offered. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to reach a fair price, but $1,200,000 is still above my target.  I'm willing to go up slightly from my previous offer.  How about $1,100,000? This is a significant savings for me, and it also allows you to make a healthy profit.  Let's work together to close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
