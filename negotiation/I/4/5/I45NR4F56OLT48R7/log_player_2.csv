"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is within your budget, it's still above your desired goal of saving as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still above your goal of getting the product for $1,000,000.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better price, especially since you have the option to buy from John for your target price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still above your desired goal of saving as much money as possible.  You've already made two counteroffers, and it seems like Alice is unwilling to go lower than $1,125,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, guaranteeing your target price.  Further negotiation with Alice risks you exceeding your budget or prolonging the process without any guarantee of a better outcome."
