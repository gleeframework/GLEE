"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity with incredible value. I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, but still below what I believe the product is worth to me. This allows room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the ""unique opportunity"" and ""incredible value"" to pique Bob's interest and make him consider the product's potential worth. 
* **Open-Ended:**  The message ends with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation and express his thoughts. 

**Important Note:**  This is just the first step. I'll need to analyze Bob's response and adapt my strategy based on his reaction in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's interest in the product indicates potential for negotiation.  By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and try to secure a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, I believe there's a good chance of getting a higher price from Bob through further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will now prepare a counteroffer to Bob in the next round. I'll need to consider the following:

* **How much lower than my initial offer should my counteroffer be?**  I need to find a price point that is attractive to Bob but still profitable for me. 
* **How can I emphasize the value of the product to Bob?**  I need to convince him that the product is worth more than his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low to make this deal work for me.  The product's unique features and potential are worth significantly more than that. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows for a successful partnership."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's price, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.  This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I continue to highlight the unique features and potential of the product. This keeps the focus on its worth and helps Bob understand why the price is justified.
* **Partnership Language:**  I use ""successful partnership"" to frame the deal as mutually beneficial, making Bob feel more invested in the outcome.

**Key Points:**

* **Counteroffer Calculation:**  I chose $1,750,000 as it's exactly halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This is a simple and visually appealing midpoint.
* **Flexibility:**  I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I won't go below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Monitoring Bob's Response:**  I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1500000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk that Bob will further lower his offer or I might not be able to close the deal within the remaining rounds.
* **Selling to John is not necessary:**  Since Bob has offered my minimum, there is no benefit to selling to John at the same price.

**Conclusion:**

I'm accepting Bob's offer as it meets my minimum requirement and ensures a sale without unnecessary risk."
