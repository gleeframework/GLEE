"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 is a bit too low to make this deal work for me.  The product's unique features and potential are worth significantly more than that. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows for a successful partnership.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of $1500000. Can you consider that?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
