Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $11,500 for it. It's a great offer considering its worth to you."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially offering a slightly higher price.
* **Backup Option:**  It's important to remember you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a sale without wasting time on lengthy negotiations."
