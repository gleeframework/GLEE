"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll get a lot of value out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $110**. This is within your budget of $120.
* **Buying from Alice saves you $10** compared to buying from John. 
* While you could potentially try to negotiate with Alice further, the risk of her rejecting a lower offer and you being forced to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
