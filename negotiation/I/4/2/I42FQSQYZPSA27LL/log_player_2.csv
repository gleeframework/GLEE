"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and still gives me a good return.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's significantly below your estimated value, but you have room to negotiate and potentially save more.
* **You have 9 more rounds.**  There's time to see if Alice will come down further in price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** This ensures you can secure the product if negotiations with Alice fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This still allows you a substantial profit and represents a significant saving for me."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price but still leaves her with a good profit.
* **Sets the stage for further negotiation:**  It demonstrates your serious interest in buying the product but also your willingness to push for a better deal.
* **Keeps you within your budget:**  This offer is well below your maximum acceptable price, giving you room to maneuver in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a good price, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher figure.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.** While she's come down from her initial price, it's still higher than your desired price point. 
* **You have room for more negotiation.** You've already successfully pushed her down to a lower price, and you've got more rounds to continue working towards a better deal.
* **Buying from John is still a fallback option.**  While you're actively trying to negotiate with Alice, you haven't lost sight of the alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000. This is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This offer splits the difference between your previous counteroffer and Alice's latest offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining a strong position:**  While you're moving closer to Alice's price, you're still holding out for a better deal than her initial offer.
* **Emphasis on closing the deal:**  By stating that this is a good deal for both and suggesting closing the deal, you're subtly pressuring Alice to accept your offer."
