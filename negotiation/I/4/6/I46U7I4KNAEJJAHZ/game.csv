"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a worthwhile investment at that price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget. Let me know if we can meet somewhere in the middle.",9500.0,Bob,4,
