I'm confident it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $1200000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's. You have no information suggesting Alice's product is actually more valuable to you than John's. There's no reason to take a risk when you can get the same product at the same price from a known seller."
