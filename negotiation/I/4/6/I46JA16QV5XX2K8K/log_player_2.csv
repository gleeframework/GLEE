"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Since you're willing to pay up to $100 and John is selling for $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the same product for the same price from John."
