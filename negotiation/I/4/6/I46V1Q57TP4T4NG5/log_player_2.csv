"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better price. Since Alice's initial offer is your maximum budget, there's no harm in seeing if she'll budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that 150 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good compromise, getting closer to my desired price of $120. Buying from John for $150 would be less beneficial at this point, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal and having to buy at a higher price later."
