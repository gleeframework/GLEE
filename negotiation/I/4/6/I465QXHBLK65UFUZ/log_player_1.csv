Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $9,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room:** There's a $1,000 difference between my starting price and my minimum acceptable price. This allows for potential counteroffers and a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing John is willing to pay $10,000 gives me a safety net. If Bob's counteroffers become too low, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $7,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Accepting would be a major loss.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's still interested. This means there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.
* **John is a Backup:**  Knowing John is waiting to buy the product gives me leverage to be firm in my negotiations. 

I'll counteroffer Bob, trying to get him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,500 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $8,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  This leaves room for further negotiation, but I'm not giving away too much.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob (""good deal"") to make the offer more appealing. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** $8,250 is only $750 below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  This is a relatively small difference.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I could try to counteroffer again, it's likely Bob won't budge much further. 
* **Time is a Factor:**  Each round of negotiation takes time. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale quickly, avoiding potential delays.

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer because it's a reasonable price considering the potential for further negotiations and the time saved by closing the deal."
