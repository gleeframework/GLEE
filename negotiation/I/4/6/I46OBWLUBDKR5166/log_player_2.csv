"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking for a price that's a bit higher than what I'd be willing to accept from someone else. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's message is full of sales tactics, and her offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than what it's worth to her ($8,000) and close to your maximum price.  There's a good chance you can get a better deal by negotiating or considering John's offer."
