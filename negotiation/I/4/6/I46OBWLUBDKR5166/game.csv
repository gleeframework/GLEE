"I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, but I have to be honest with you, I'm looking for a price that's a bit higher than what I'd be willing to accept from someone else. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
