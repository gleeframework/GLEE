{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You are aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob finds the offer acceptable. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.
* **Securing a Significant Gain:** This price point ensures you make a substantial profit above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.

By starting high but still below Bob's perceived value, you increase the likelihood of securing a deal that's highly favorable for you."
