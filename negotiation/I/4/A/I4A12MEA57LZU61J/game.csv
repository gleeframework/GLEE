"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly exceptional, and $1,400,000 undervalues its potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
