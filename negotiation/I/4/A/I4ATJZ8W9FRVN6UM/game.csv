"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",15500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15500. I'm willing to meet you at $16200, which is a compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",16200.0,Alice,5,
