Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for both of us to profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a fair compromise considering both our positions. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

We're still a ways off from a price I'm happy with. Bob is moving, which is good, but we need to incentivize him to move faster towards our goal."
