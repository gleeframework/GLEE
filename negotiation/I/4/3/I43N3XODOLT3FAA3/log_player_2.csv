"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of the product ($100). This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $110 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than Alice's value of the product ($100). This means there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better price."
