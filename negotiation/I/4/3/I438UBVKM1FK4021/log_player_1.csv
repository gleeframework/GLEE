Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer. After careful consideration, I am willing to lower the price to $820,000. I hope this proposal aligns better with your budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $820,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I propose a price of $850,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I'd prefer a higher price, this offer is within my minimum desired price range. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least $800,000 and minimizes the risk of losing out on the deal entirely."
