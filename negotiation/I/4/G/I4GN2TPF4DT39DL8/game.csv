"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1750000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it.  This price is fair and reflects the value I see in the product. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints,  $1400000 is significantly below the product's worth. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price. I'm prepared to accept $1600000. This represents a good value for you and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1500000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
