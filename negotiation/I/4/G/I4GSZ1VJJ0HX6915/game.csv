"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $1200000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to me and gives you a substantial profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $950000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950000. This price gives you a healthy profit while remaining within my budget. Let's work together to find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're committed to your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, which is a bit higher than my previous offer but still a compromise. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While $1050000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950000.  Let's split the difference and go with $1000000.  This price is fair for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1000000, which is $1025000. This price is still a compromise, but it's closer to my target and reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
