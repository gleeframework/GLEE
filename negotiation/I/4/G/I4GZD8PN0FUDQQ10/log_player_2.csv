"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1050000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1150000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,150,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price again. Bob can still counteroffer and potentially get a better deal or simply buy from John to avoid further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair offer that allows for a good profit for you while staying within my financial limitations. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1100000 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1120000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,120,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's time to cut his losses and move on. Buying from John at $1,000,000 guarantees the product at a price that fits within his budget.  Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but it also carries the risk of Alice walking away from the deal altogether."
