Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $14,500. I believe it provides significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aim high to maximize potential profit.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,500 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (though still well above your minimum).
* **Highlight Value:**  By mentioning the product's worth to Bob ($15,000), you emphasize the good deal he's getting.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a secure offer from John at $10,000, ensuring you won't be left empty-handed if Bob declines."
