"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operation, and I'm excited to discuss a deal. To start the conversation, I'm offering it at $2,250,000."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high price of $2,250,000 sets a strong anchor. Even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value, it gives us room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a price well above our minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message implies the product's high value, justifying the price somewhat without revealing its true worth to us. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states this is a starting point, signaling to Bob that we're open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $1,000,000. This is my best and final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's ""best and final"" offer at this stage is a common negotiation tactic.  It's far too early to settle. We have plenty of rounds left, and we know John provides a safety net at our minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but I have to be honest, $1,000,000 is significantly below its market value. I can't let it go for anything less than $2,000,000. This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to find a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Hold Firm (For Now):** While we're moving closer to Bob's valuation, a large gap still exists.  We're holding relatively firm to signal the product's value and test his resolve.
* **Smaller Concession:** We decrease our price by $250,000, a significant amount, but smaller than his jump from our initial offer. This shows movement but maintains a strong stance.
* **Justification:** We vaguely mention ""market value"" without stating a specific figure. This subtly implies external validation for our higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation (Subtly):**  The phrasing ""fair deal for both of us"" subtly keeps the door open for negotiation without directly inviting a counteroffer like in Round 1."
