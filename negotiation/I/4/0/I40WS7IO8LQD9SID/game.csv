"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $950,000. I am willing to pay up to $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is lower than I initially hoped for, I'm willing to negotiate further.  I'm prepared to lower my price to $850,000. This price still reflects the significant value of the product for your business, while allowing for a reasonable profit for me.  I believe this is a fair compromise and a great opportunity for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,
