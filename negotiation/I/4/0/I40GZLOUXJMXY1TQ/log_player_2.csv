"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and while it's less than your maximum value, it's still a great deal. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's maximum value for the product is $1,200,000.  Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is above that limit.  Therefore, it's more beneficial for Bob to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000."
