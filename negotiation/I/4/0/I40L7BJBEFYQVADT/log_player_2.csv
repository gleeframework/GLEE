"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a strong offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Bob can make a counteroffer to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $875,000 is a good price, as it's significantly lower than John's price, and still allows for a reasonable profit for Alice.  Further negotiation might result in a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price is too high."
