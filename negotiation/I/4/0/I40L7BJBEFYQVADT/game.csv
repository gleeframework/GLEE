"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a strong offer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is a bit high for me at this moment.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you justifies a higher price. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a new price of $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
