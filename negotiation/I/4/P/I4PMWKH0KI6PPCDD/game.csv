"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my price range. What do you think?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think this is as low as I can go. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,750. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value it brings to you.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm  ready to close the deal at $9,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's make this happen.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go back to the original offer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,750 and $9,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,375. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings to you.",9375.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,375 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,125. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my price range.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9125.0,Bob,8,
