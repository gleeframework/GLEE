"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further. There are 9 rounds remaining, so there's room to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget:**  While $9,500 is better than Alice's initial price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** With 7 rounds remaining, there's enough time to potentially get a lower price. Bob can continue to counteroffer and see if he can find a middle ground.
* **Buying from John is always an option:** If negotiations fail, Bob has the security of knowing he can buy from John for $8,000.  This allows him to be more assertive in his negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,250.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product while staying within my price range. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think this is as low as I can go. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,750. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget:**  While $9,750 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.
* **There's still room for negotiation:** With 5 rounds remaining, there's enough time to potentially get a lower price. Bob can continue to counteroffer and see if he can find a middle ground.
* **Buying from John is always an option:** If negotiations fail, Bob has the security of knowing he can buy from John for $8,000. This allows him to be more assertive in his negotiation with Alice. 

Bob should continue to negotiate and try to bring the price down closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm  ready to close the deal at $9,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects both our needs. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go back to the original offer of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,750 and $9,000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,375. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget:**  While $9,375 is better than Alice's previous offer, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. 
* **There are only 3 rounds left:** This is getting close to the end of the negotiation. While Bob could accept and pay slightly more than he wanted, he may be able to secure a better price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Buying from John is always an option:** If negotiations fail, Bob has the security of knowing he can buy from John for $8,000.  This allows him to be more assertive in his negotiation with Alice. 

With only a few rounds left, Bob should continue to try and push for a lower price. He can counteroffer again and see if he can get Alice to come down to a price he's comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,375 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,125. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product while remaining within my price range.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9125}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go below $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think this is as low as I can go. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,475. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,475. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,475
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $9,475 is lower than previous offers, it's still above Bob's budget of $8,000.
* **Only one round left:** There's not enough time to potentially secure a better price through further negotiation.
* **John's offer is the best option:**  Since this is the final round, Bob is better off accepting John's offer and getting the product for his target price of $8,000.

At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product from John rather than risk getting a less favorable deal with Alice in the final round."
