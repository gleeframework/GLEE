"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. It's a steal at this price, and I think you'll be thrilled with your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $15,000 for the product from John, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at the same price.  You might be able to get a better deal by rejecting and seeing if Alice counters with a lower price."
