"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $175? That's a fair compromise, I think.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $175, so how about $145?",145.0,Bob,4,
