"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could come down to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,400,000 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. I appreciate you meeting me in the middle.  How about we settle on $1,300,000? This price reflects the value while hopefully working for you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  If you can make that work, I'm ready to close the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
