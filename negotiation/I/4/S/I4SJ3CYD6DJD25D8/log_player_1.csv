"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it for $100, which is a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $70 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is the lowest I can go.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
I'm offering a counteroffer of $90.  This is still above my minimum and allows for some room for negotiation.  However, it is closer to my perceived value of the product and may be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we split the difference and meet at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get more, accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation. It also saves me the time and effort of continuing the negotiation process."
