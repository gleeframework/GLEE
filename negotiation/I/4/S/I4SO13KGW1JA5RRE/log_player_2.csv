"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value of your business operations. Given its high quality and functionality, I estimate its true worth to be well above $8,000. Considering this, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for a special introductory price of $12,000. This offer includes a comprehensive warranty and exceptional customer support. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this exclusive deal. I look forward to potentially working with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While her product might be worth $15,000 to her, it's only worth a maximum of $8,000 to you. Her offer of $12,000 is significantly above your budget.
* **You have a better alternative:** John is offering the product for $8,000, which meets your budget. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can negotiate from a stronger position or simply proceed to buy from John at your desired price."
