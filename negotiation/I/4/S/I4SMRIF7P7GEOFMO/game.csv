"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise there.",11000.0,Bob,4,
