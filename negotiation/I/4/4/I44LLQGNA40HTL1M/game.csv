"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I'm interested,  $15,000 is beyond my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $11,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. To be frank, $11,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Could you meet me halfway at $8,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you really want this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're very close.  I'm willing to make this work, but $9,500 is pushing my absolute limit. How about we settle at $8,750?  That's a fair compromise, and I can close the deal today at that price.",8750.0,Bob,6,
