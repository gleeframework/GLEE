"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your perspective,  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the compromise. However, I am still unable to meet you at $1,100,000. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as my maximum offer for your product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
