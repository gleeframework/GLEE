"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, aiming to get him to negotiate down. 
* **Leaving Room:**  The price is still lower than the minimum I'd accept, allowing for some negotiation without risking a deal with John. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value and opportunity, hoping to build a positive relationship early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.** I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000, so accepting his offer would be a loss.
* **I have 9 rounds left and the potential to negotiate a better price with Bob.** I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a safety net, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.** It's worth trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement before defaulting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I understand your perspective,  $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price, making it more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending the message with a question to keep the conversation open and encourage further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the compromise. However, I am still unable to meet you at $1,100,000. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as my maximum offer for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Time is Running Out:** We are only in round 4, and I want to avoid risking a deal with John if I keep rejecting offers.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer $1,000,000, accepting this offer leaves room for potential future deals with Bob, especially if he proves to be a good customer.

Accepting this offer is the most strategic move at this point. It secures a reasonable profit and avoids the risk of losing out on both Bob and John."
