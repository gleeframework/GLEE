Round 2

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $95. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

While Bob is showing continued interest, it's unlikely he'll go above $100.  Selling to John now guarantees the minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a downside risk with little potential upside."
