Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with a slightly lower offer ($1,400,000) leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Secure the Higher Sale:** It's better to aim high initially, as we can always accept Bob's counteroffer or sell to John for our minimum price ($1,200,000) if needed."
