Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great [product name] and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum value. This allows room for negotiation and gives me more leverage.
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the product's value to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open-ended question:** By asking ""What do you think?"" I encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and make a counteroffer. 

**Why this approach:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:** Starting high gives me the best chance of earning the most money.
* **Initiates the negotiation:** A clear price and an open-ended question get the conversation going.
* **Provides a strong initial position:**  By presenting a compelling offer, I set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Since I can also sell to John for the same price, accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale and avoids further negotiation.  It's not worth risking losing the sale by trying to get a higher price, especially since I have a guaranteed alternative buyer."
