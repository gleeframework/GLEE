Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value but below your minimum:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring you get a profit.
* **It's a reasonable opening offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate but also value your product.
* **It includes a friendly message:** Building rapport can help the negotiation go smoother."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $125 is a good starting point, it's still below my minimum selling price. How about we split the difference and go with $150? It's a fair price that ensures we both get what we want."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $130? It's a fair price that's closer to my budget and still a good deal for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below it. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation, especially when I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price of $150."
