Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $900,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $850,000, and I'll throw in some additional support and services to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still more expensive than John's offer of $800,000. At this point, the potential savings of $50,000 outweigh any ""sweeteners"" Alice might offer. You've reached a point where further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price that beats John's offer."
