"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1025000. This is a fair price that should work for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1025000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm prepared to pay $1000000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1000000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
