"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $12,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is closer to his maximum budget but still leaves some room for negotiation. By offering $10,500, Bob is showing Alice that he is serious about buying the product but is also trying to secure a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $10,000. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Additionally,  Bob knows he can get the product from John for $10,000, so he's not under significant pressure to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I can manage right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by offering a price in the middle of Alice's offer and his previous counteroffer.  This shows Alice he is serious about making a deal, but still wants a price that's more favorable to him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still just a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go with $11,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. With only 5 rounds left, the negotiations are getting tight, and the potential for further price reductions is uncertain.  Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $10,000. It's better to take the guaranteed lower price from John rather than risk going over his budget with Alice."
