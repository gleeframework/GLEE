Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $10,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counter-offer."

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit more than I can manage right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
