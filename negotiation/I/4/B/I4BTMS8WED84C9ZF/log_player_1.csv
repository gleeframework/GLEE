Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

This offer is a starting point.  It allows me to make a decent profit while also leaving room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a price closer to Bob's perceived value, but I'm not willing to settle for anything less than $10,000, as I can sell to John for that amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my original offer, it's still significantly less than I want to make. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price closer to my desired $12,000.  Bob is clearly motivated to buy, so I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is getting too low for me.  I'm not willing to drop my price below $10,000. I'll take John's offer, which at least guarantees me a decent profit."
