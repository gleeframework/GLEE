It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Alice has offered a good starting point, but Bob can likely do better."

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, Bob can still try to negotiate further."

Bob has already negotiated a significant discount from Alice's original price.  At this point, the price difference between Alice's offer and John's is only $62,500.  It's likely that further negotiation with Alice will only yield a small additional savings.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob to get the product at a reasonable price while minimizing the risk of losing out on the deal entirely."
