"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe it's a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're still significantly above Bob's perceived value of the product ($1,200,000). While we don't want to scare him off, there's room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see your point about finding a fair middle ground. Let's make this work. I'm willing to accept $1,800,000 for the product.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to see this product in the hands of someone who recognizes its potential."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're now getting close to the point where John's offer becomes more appealing. By splitting the difference from the last round, we show a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a strong price.  This might be our last chance to secure a deal significantly above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer $1,750,000 for the product. I believe this is the best compromise considering the value and price we've discussed so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly pushing his budget, and we've reached a price point where the risk of continuing outweighs the potential reward. Accepting his offer of $1,750,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
