"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm confident its value to you will make this a mutually beneficial transaction.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it falls short of the true value I place on this product.
