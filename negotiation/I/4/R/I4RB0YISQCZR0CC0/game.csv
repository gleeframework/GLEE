"I understand that $12500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13250, but that's as low as I can go. I'm not willing to go below that price.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"I've already met you halfway twice, Bob, and I'm starting to think we're getting close to a fair price. However, I still need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $13250 again, but I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",13250.0,Alice,7,
