"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,350,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is my maximum offer, as I can purchase the product from another vendor for that price.  Let me know if you're open to this."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have another buyer interested at a higher price point. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense for Bob to secure the product at that price rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice."
