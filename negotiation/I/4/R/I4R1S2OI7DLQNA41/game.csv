"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,300,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,350,000?  This price still allows me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've reviewed your latest offer and while I appreciate the effort to meet somewhere in the middle, I'm still seeking to keep my expenses lower. Could we perhaps agree on $1,325,000? This would allow us to both feel satisfied with the transaction.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
