"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I'm looking for $12000 for it. Would you like to make an offer or accept my price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is above his maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice first, as he might be able to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $11,000 is closer to his maximum budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay.  He can get the same product from John for $10,000, so it makes sense to keep trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $10,500.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I can do a bit better than that. I'll offer it to you for $10800. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  He has already rejected Alice's offer of $10,800, which is higher than his maximum budget of $10,000.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to negotiate any lower. Therefore, it makes sense to buy the product from John for $10,000, saving $800 compared to Alice's offer."
