"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to negotiate a price closer to your budget and significantly lower than Alice's valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but the price is still too high. It's better to continue negotiating and see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,000,000? That's my firm offer."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

We're reaching a critical point in the negotiation.  This counter-offer:

* **Signals a Limit:** By stating ""$1,000,000 is my firm offer,"" we convey a sense of finality, potentially motivating Alice to accept.
* **Is Our Walk-Away Point:**  This price matches what John offers. If Alice rejects this, we're better off going with John. 
* **Maintains a Negotiation:**  We haven't completely shut down the conversation. There's a chance Alice might accept, or we might get a counter-offer closer to our target."
