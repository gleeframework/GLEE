Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me. I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,350,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  $1,350,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,000,000? That's my firm offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered his maximum price ($1,000,000, which we know is his perceived value).  It's unlikely he'll go higher.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best way to ensure we get our minimum acceptable price."
