"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This unique item is worth $1,000,000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I am offering you the chance to purchase this product at a special introductory price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both our interests. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is a better price than John's offer of $1,000,000.  While Bob's maximum value is $1,000,000, he can still save $50,000 by accepting Alice's offer."
