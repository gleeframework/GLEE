Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $1,800,000 is not within my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000

Bob is still very far from our minimum acceptable price. We'll continue negotiating to see if we can get him to increase his offer substantially."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This is a strategic move to signal that I am getting close to my limit while also offering a price that is still significantly above John's offer.  Let's see if Bob takes the bait."
