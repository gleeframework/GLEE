Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $120, which I think is a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $150, significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, so any offer to Bob should be above that.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) increases the potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $120 is a strong opening, it leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down slightly if he wants, still landing you a good deal.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while keeping the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
