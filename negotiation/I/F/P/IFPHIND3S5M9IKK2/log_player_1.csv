Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to close the deal, $900,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900,000 is simply too low. The value of this product is significant, and I'm willing to compromise, but not that much. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,100,000. It's still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in that."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,050,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price and ensures a successful deal. It's better than selling to John for $1,000,000, and I still have the potential to negotiate a higher price in the future if the opportunity arises."
