,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is way too high. I'm only willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the maximum value it holds for me. Let's start our negotiation from here.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply not enough. Considering the value this product holds for you,  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects both of our needs.  Let's work together to reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you coming down, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still too far off from what this product is truly worth.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's close this deal now.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product and allows us to come to an agreement.  Let's close this deal now.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This would allow us to close the deal quickly and fairly.  Time is running out, so let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand we are both trying to reach a deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,025,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This is a fair price that allows us to close the deal and avoids the need to go through further rounds.  Let's finalize this now.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to meet me halfway. $1,000,000 is a good offer, but I need to be closer to my target price to make this work.  Let's split the difference one last time. I'm willing to sell the product for $1,050,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  This is my final offer,  so let's finalize this now.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
