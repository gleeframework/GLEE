"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $250 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $250 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $200. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in!",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $200 is still a little more than my budget allows. How about we split the difference and I pay $175?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",175.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $175. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $225. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in!",225.0,Alice,5,
