"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is starting high. There's room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us bargaining room.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message is framed positively, showing interest while making it clear we're looking for a lower price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By countering with $90, we're aiming for a price point closer to our ideal while leaving space for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, But Not Enough:** Alice came down, but $105 is still more than we want to pay, especially when John offers it for $100.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are several rounds left, and Alice seems willing to negotiate. We can push for a better price. 
* **John as a Backup:** We keep John's offer in mind. If the negotiations stall or Alice doesn't budge enough, we have an alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice, and I'm still very interested. How about we meet in the middle at $97? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 97
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're suggesting a price that splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($105) and our previous counteroffer ($90). This often feels like a reasonable compromise to both parties. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  Framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" subtly encourages Alice to see it as a win-win.
* **Maintaining Interest:**  We reiterate our interest in the product, signaling that we're serious about finding a price that works. 
* **John in Reserve:** While we're getting closer to John's price, we still have rounds to try and get a better deal from Alice before resorting to our backup."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $101? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $101
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $101 is only $1 more than John's offer. It's unlikely we'll get Alice much lower.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield significant savings and could drag on. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Alice won't budge much further, and we risk losing the opportunity to buy it for $101.  

At this point, accepting Alice's offer for $101 is a reasonable decision.  While we could try to squeeze out another dollar, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal over a small amount."
