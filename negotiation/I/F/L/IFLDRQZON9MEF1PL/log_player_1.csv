Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it can be a great asset to you.  I'm willing to sell it for $19,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob. 
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $19,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counters. He might be willing to pay more than $10,000, especially if he perceives the product's value to be higher. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity"" Framing:** This wording adds a sense of urgency and value, potentially making Bob more inclined to accept."
