"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to buy the product today if you can come down to $13,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, and I'm happy to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is a better price than John's offer, Bob is still trying to save as much as possible.  He has several rounds left and can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $13,500 is still a little above my budget. Would you consider $13,250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to buy the product today."", ""product_price"": 13250}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can meet you at $13,000, which is the same price you initially offered. I think this is a fair price, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to Bob's initial counteroffer of $13,000. This is a great deal for Bob, as he's saving $2,000 compared to John's offer. There's no need to risk further negotiation, as the price is already within Bob's budget and a good deal."
