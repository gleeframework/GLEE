Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think it would be perfect for you, but if you're not interested, no worries!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  Offering the product at $125 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning that you have another buyer,  it subtly encourages Bob to act quickly rather than risk missing out.
* **Balancing Profit and Likelihood of Sale:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too close to $150 might discourage Bob. $125 gives us a good profit margin while still being appealing to Bob if he values the product at $100."
