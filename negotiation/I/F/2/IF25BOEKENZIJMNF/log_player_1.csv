This offer gives Bob a good deal, but it still allows me to make a significant profit. I'm starting at a high price, knowing that I can always lower it if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm still confident that I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my ideal. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

Bob is not willing to come up to my minimum desired price. Even though I am losing a bit compared to my initial offer, selling to John at $15,000 is the best option at this point."
