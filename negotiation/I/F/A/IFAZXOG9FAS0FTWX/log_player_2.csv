"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice is asking for $12,000. This means there's room for negotiation.
* **Rejecting allows for counter-offering.** By rejecting, you can make a lower offer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $10,000. How about we try $11,500?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is asking for $11,250. This is a good deal for both of you.
* **Rejecting carries risk.**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice will either reject your counteroffer or become unwilling to negotiate further. This could lead to you having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Accepting is the best option.**  $11,250 is a good price for you, and it's likely the best you'll get from Alice. It's better than risking a worse outcome."
