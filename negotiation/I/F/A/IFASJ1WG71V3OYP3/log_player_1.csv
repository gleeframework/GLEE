Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth your while. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value ($80), giving you some room to negotiate.**
* **It's below your minimum value ($120), so you're still making a profit.**
* **It shows you're open to negotiation, making Bob more likely to engage.** 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to stay within my budget of $80 for this product. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than Bob's initial offer of $80, it's still below my minimum value of $120.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a deal that doesn't at least meet my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I can't go lower than $95. This is a great deal for a product that's worth much more.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns.** This shows him I'm listening and willing to compromise.
* **I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum value ($120).**  
* **I'm highlighting the value of the product.** This could make Bob more willing to pay a higher price. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but if not, I'm prepared to potentially go another round or sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly agree on a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stubbornly stuck to his $90 offer, and I've already countered with my lowest acceptable price of $95.  While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum value.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum price of $120, it's more beneficial for me to sell to him."
