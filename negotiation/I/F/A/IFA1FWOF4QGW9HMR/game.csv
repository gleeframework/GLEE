,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $12,500. How about we try $11,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",11800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen. How about $12,200?  This is my final offer.",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11,900? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",11900.0,Bob,6,
