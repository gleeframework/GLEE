,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1100000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1100000 is a fair offer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1200000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1200000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm prepared to go to $1150000.  Let's meet halfway there.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1150000. I'm still not quite there yet.  To make this work for me, I need to be at $1180000.  Let's bridge the gap and get this deal done.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
