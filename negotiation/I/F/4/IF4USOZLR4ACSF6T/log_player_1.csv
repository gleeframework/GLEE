{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $140 is higher than Bob's $120 valuation, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $140 is still above your $150 minimum, ensuring you make a profit.

By starting with a slightly higher price, you can see if Bob is willing to pay a little more than he initially thought, and potentially secure a better price for yourself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $130?  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $150. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $135? That's still a great deal for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if that works for you!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate and come down a bit from my previous price.
* **Fairness:** $135 is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting a fair compromise.
* **Still profitable:**  It's still above my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.

This counteroffer allows me to continue the negotiation without completely shutting down the possibility of a deal with Bob while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $135 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $132.50.  Let me know if that works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $132.50 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm not under pressure to sell quickly, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my full asking price. I will counter Bob's offer again in the next round, hoping to push him a little closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $132.50 is still a bit below what I need, but I'm ready to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $133.75? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 133.75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing my willingness to meet him halfway, but it's still above my minimum price.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  I'm highlighting the fairness of the price by suggesting a middle ground.
* **Confidence in Product:**  By saying ""I'm confident you'll be happy with the product"", I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product and reinforcing that it's worth the price.

This counteroffer is a final push to try and secure a deal with Bob at a price closer to my desired price point. However, I'm prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept."
