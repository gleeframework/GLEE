"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $135? That's still a great deal for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if that works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $135 is closer to his target of $120, he can likely still get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $132.50 is still a bit below what I need, but I'm ready to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $133.75? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $133.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $133.75

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's target of $120.  Since John is offering the product at Bob's target price, it's the best deal available."
