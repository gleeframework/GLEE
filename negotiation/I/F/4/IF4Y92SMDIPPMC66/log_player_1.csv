Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I understand his budget constraints, his offer is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget concerns. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm happy to see him moving closer to my desired price, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I can't go lower than $1,400,000. This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $1,250,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer, his offer is still below my minimum. I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and I'm concerned that if I continue, I might end up with a price that is too low. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
