"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,200,000 to you.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $1,200,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, knowing your maximum valuation. You're better off rejecting her offer. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at a lower price."
