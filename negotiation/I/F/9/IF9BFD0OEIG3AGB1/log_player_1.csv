{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, leaving room for potential compromise. It also emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value of $100. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $95 is the best price. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with it.  I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer to see if we can close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm trying to be flexible. I'm willing to drop my price a little more to $90.  Let's meet in the middle, and I'm confident we can finalize this."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not willing to pay $90. I'd be willing to meet you at $85, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been firm on his price, and it's clear we're unlikely to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.  While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, it's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $100 from John."
