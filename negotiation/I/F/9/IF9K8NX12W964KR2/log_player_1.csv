We're still significantly above John's offer. It's worth pushing a little further to see if Bob will budge."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $975,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $962,500. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

While we're still a bit away from our initial target, accepting Bob's offer at $962,500 is the most profitable decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** $962,500 is a substantial profit margin over John's offer of $800,000. 
* **Bob's Final Offer:**  Bob has stated this is his final counteroffer.  Continuing negotiations might push him away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of further delays and allows us to move on to other opportunities."
