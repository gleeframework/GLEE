"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer that I think is fair and reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $925,000. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
