"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $825,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and the effort I've put into it.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a mutually beneficial deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
