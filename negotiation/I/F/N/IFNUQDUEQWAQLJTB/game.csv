"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1200000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1100000 is closer, it's still a bit out of reach for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $950000.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility. While $1050000 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to $1000000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1025000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to go that low. I can offer you a price of $1075000. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1075000 is still a little high for me. I'm very interested in this product, and we've been very close to a deal. To make this work, I'm willing to offer a final price of $1035000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1035000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to make concessions. I'm willing to meet you at $1040000. This is a slight increase from your latest offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1040000.0,Alice,9,
