# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8500. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth that much to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While Alice is trying to frame it as a good deal, it's still above Bob's maximum price.  It's worth negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8250. That's still a fair price considering what you're getting and what it's worth to me. Let's meet in the middle.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a bit closer to his target price, he can likely still negotiate a better deal.  He's already shown he's willing to walk away, and it seems like Alice is willing to continue bargaining."
