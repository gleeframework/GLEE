"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $8500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to pay $7500 for the product, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8250. That's still a fair price considering what you're getting and what it's worth to me. Let's meet in the middle.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $8250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's your minimum and within my budget. Let's finalize the deal at this price.",8000.0,Bob,4,
