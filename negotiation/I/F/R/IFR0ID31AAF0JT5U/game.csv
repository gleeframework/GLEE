"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to you and still allows me to achieve a substantial return. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still gives you a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,025,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
