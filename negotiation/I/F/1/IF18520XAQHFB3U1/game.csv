"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy it for $12,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $12,500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,250?  That's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to make this deal work. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12,800 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12800.0,Bob,4,
