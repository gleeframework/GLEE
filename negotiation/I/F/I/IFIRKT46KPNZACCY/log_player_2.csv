"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $9,000 is still a bit too high, so rejecting and counter-offering gives you a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being flexible. I'm really interested in this product, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200

Alice is still above my target price, but she is showing flexibility.  I'll try to push for a lower price again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $8,800? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,800 just yet. I can do $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still a bit higher than my target price, but we're getting closer.  I'll see if I can squeeze out a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting really close!  I'm very serious about buying this, but I need to stay under $9,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,900?  I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $9,100, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be thrilled with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, we're very close to my ideal price. While $9,100 is still a little more than I'd like to pay, I'm confident I can get a better deal elsewhere if I reject this offer. It's a good compromise, and it's worth taking to avoid the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
