"Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a significant deviation from my initial asking price.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your business. How about meeting halfway at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your point about the product's value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,000,000 to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $950,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
