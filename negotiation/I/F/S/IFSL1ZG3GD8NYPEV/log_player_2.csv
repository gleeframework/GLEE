"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be really valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Interested:**  I want to maintain a positive tone and express my interest in the product to encourage further negotiation.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts me in a good position. Even if Alice rejects it, I'm signaling that I'm willing to pay a decent amount, but not an unreasonable one."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While Alice came down in price, she's still significantly above my target. There's space to negotiate further.
* **John's Price as Leverage:**  I know I have the option to buy from John for $8,000. This gives me a strong bargaining position. 
* **Aiming for the Middle Ground:** I'll try to meet Alice somewhere in the middle between her current offer and my last one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. I'm still pretty set on something closer to $7,000. Would you be open to meeting me there?"", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($9,000) and my previous one ($6,000).
* **Firm but Fair:** My message is polite but firm. I'm signaling that I'm serious about buying, but not at any cost. 
* **Nearing the Walk-Away Point:**  While $7,000 is still a decent amount below Alice's desired price, it's getting closer to the point where I might consider buying from John. This adds a bit of pressure to the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $7,000 is still too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,500. This is a significant discount from my original asking price and a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge further:** Alice has framed her offer as ""final"" and is already close to her bottom line.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower than $8,500.
* **John's offer is more appealing:** While $500 isn't a huge difference, I've already invested time negotiating with Alice. John offers a sure thing at my target price. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly better price from Alice, but there's no guarantee. Accepting John's offer saves me time and potential frustration."
