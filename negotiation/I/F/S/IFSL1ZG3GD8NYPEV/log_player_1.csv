{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be really valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price.  This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see if Bob is seriously interested.  If he rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop below $12,000 at this point.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. I'm still pretty set on something closer to $7,000. Would you be open to meeting me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly below what I'm hoping for. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm going to be more firm in my price point. I'm not going to let Bob completely dictate the price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $7,000 is still too low for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer the product for $8,500. This is a significant discount from my original asking price and a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested in this final offer."", ""product_price"": 8500}
