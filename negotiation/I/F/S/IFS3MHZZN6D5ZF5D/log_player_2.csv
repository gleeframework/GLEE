"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique item that we believe could greatly benefit you. Considering its high quality and exceptional features, I propose a price of $100 for it. Please let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower. There are 9 more rounds to negotiate, and a better deal might be possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $100 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $75?  I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground.  $75 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential negotiation in future rounds.  It also expresses an interest in the product, while demonstrating a willingness to be firm on my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and am willing to negotiate. I propose a price of $90 for the product. This still reflects its value, but I hope it aligns better with your current financial situation. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to suggest another price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my budget, I still believe I can get a better price.  I want to see if Alice will come down further before considering her offer. There are still 7 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. I'm really interested in this product, but $90 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend. Would you consider $80? I think it would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm trying to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, while keeping my budget in mind.  $80 is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still pushes for a lower price.  This also demonstrates that I'm genuinely interested in the product and want to make a deal."
