**Reasoning:** Bob is very unlikely to go above $13,000.  While I could try to squeeze another few hundred out of him, it's getting too risky. John offers a guaranteed $12,000 which is a safe and acceptable outcome at this point.  It's better to take the sure thing than risk ending up with a lower offer or no deal at all."
