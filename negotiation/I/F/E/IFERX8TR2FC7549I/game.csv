"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you and my own budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your desire to find a price that works for both of us. While your valuation is fair, the product's value to me is higher than you initially estimated. I'm willing to come down slightly, but not to $900,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true value of this product.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This is a compromise that takes into account the product's value to you while still being within my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
