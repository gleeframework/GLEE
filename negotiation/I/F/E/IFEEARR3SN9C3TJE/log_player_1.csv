{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal as it's worth much more to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price closer to the $12,000 value Bob places on it, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation. This price is higher than my minimum, so I'm still in a good position even if Bob rejects the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500? This still leaves you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $8,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for a budget under $8,000.  Would you be willing to meet me at $8,000 even? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking losing the sale completely and having to settle with John for the same amount."
