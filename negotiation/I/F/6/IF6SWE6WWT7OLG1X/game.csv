"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit more than I can afford right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $9,000?  I'm sure we can work something out.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",10000.0,Bob,4,
