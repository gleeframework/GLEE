"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is worth a lot. I'm willing to let it go for $10000. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $10,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for less from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate you're willing to part with the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm able to spend right now.  I'd be happy to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
