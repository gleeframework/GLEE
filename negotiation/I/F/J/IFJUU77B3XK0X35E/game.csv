"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While $1,000,000 is a good starting point, I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
