Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.
