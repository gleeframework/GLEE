"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. It's a game-changer in its industry and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree your product is impressive, that price is a little high for me. I'm prepared to offer $700,000. This is a fair starting point considering my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  I can do $750,000.  That's a solid offer, and I'm hoping we can find an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, though. I'll meet you at $795,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I am ready to buy.  How about we settle at $775,000?  That's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $790,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll counter at $787,500. This is the best I can do. What do you think?",787500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're really getting close now. I'm willing to budge a bit to finalize this deal.  What if we split the difference between our last offers and land at $781,250?  That seems like a fair resolution for both of us.",781250.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that we're close, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $785,000. I'll counter at $785,000, which is just a small increase from our previous offers. This is the best I can do. What do you think?",785000.0,Alice,9,
