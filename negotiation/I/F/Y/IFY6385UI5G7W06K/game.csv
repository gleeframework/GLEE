"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  That's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $9,250. I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your efforts.  $9,250 is still a little lower than I'd like.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,375?  I think that's a fair price, considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",9375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,375. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $9,312.50. I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",9312.5,Bob,6,
