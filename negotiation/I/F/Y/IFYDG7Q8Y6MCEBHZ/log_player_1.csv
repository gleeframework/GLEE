Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate it, $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to buy it for $85. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum of $100.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $90.  This is my final offer, let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $90 isn't my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he'll walk away. It's better to get $90 than risk getting nothing."
