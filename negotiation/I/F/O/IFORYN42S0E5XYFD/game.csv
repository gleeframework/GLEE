"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the introductory price, $500000 is a bit too steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  This would be a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to engage in discussions. Considering the value and uniqueness of our product, I am proposing a revised price of $750000 for the transaction. This price reflects a balance between the product's value and your budget constraints, aiming to ensure mutual satisfaction.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $750000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to go up to $1250000. This would be a good compromise for both of us, allowing us to reach an agreement quickly.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
