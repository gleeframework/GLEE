""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to get as close to his valuation as possible without going over, leaving him with a perceived gain.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John at $800,000, so you can afford to aim higher with Bob.

**The Offer:** $925,000 is a strong starting point. It allows for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum."
