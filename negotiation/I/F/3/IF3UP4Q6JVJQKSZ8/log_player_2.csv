"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however, the value of this product is truly significant and  $750,000 is too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say at $1,200,000?
