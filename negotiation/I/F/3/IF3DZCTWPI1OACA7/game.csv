"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  To be honest, anything over $100 is a tough sell for me.  How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to compromise, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what I'd like to get, so I'm offering it to you for $135.",135.0,Alice,5,
