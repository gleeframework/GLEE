"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to make a fair offer to start. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, I'm working with a tight budget and $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7,500. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. It shows you're serious about making a deal. How about we settle at $6,900? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",6900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,900 is still a bit lower than my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $7,800. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",7800.0,Alice,5,
