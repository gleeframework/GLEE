"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the market value is much higher, but I'm willing to make a concession to work with you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $900,000 is a decent offer, you know John will sell it to you for $1,500,000.  There's room for Alice to lower her price, so it's worth seeing if she'll come down further."
