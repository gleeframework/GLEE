"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $25,000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $15,000.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $25,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $15,000. I can meet you in the middle at $20,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",20000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $20,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident this product is worth $15,000, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make that work.  Let's try to close this deal, what do you say?",15000.0,Bob,4,
