Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above your minimum ($100).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob. If Bob negotiates, you can slightly lower the price while still remaining above your minimum. 
* **Secure a Sale:**  While John offers a guaranteed $100, selling to Bob quickly at $95 avoids potential delays and guarantees a profit.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
