{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum value of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum value of $120. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $88? I'm really interested in the product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $90, but I'm not going to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, $90 is still above my maximum value of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate one more time to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. I'm hoping Alice will budge a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go to $89, which I think is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can finally reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 89}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I can do $90, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear that she won't go lower than $90. This is still above my maximum value of $120. While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely that Alice will be stubborn and stick to her price. It's better to save time and buy the product from John for $120, which is my maximum threshold."
