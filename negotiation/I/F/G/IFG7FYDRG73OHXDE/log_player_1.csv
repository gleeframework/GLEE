""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $9,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Securing a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at this price point guarantees a profit significantly higher than the $8,000 backup offer from John."
