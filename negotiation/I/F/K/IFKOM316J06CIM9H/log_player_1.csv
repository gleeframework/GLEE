{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:**  This price is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($800,000), and it leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a good profit.
* **Message:** I'm being polite and respectful, explaining the value of the product while leaving room for Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Strategy:** This initial offer sets a high bar and leaves space for negotiation. By starting high, I can potentially secure a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great!  The deal is done.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer myself. 
* **If negotiations stall:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000, guaranteeing me a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I want to make a deal, I won't settle for a price that's below my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and it's worth $800,000 to me.  There's room for negotiation, but I need to maintain a good profit.
* **Negotiation:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiations and potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price.
* **Fallback Option:**  I have the option to sell to John for $800,000, providing me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $700,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to benefit from the transaction.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$850,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility. It's also significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, allowing me to make a good profit.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also highlighting the potential benefits for both of us. This message aims to keep the negotiations open and friendly. 
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a favorable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great!  We've reached an agreement.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide if it's acceptable or if I should make another counteroffer.
* **If negotiations stall:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $800,000, guaranteeing me a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more affordable. Could we agree on $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm not willing to accept a price that leaves me with a smaller profit.  

I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating with Bob.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. I believe there's still room for him to increase his offer. 
* **Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows that I'm not desperate to sell. I'm willing to walk away if he doesn't meet my minimum requirements.
* **Fallback Option:**  I have a safety net with John's offer of $800,000, which allows me to continue negotiating without feeling pressured.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to reach a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* If Bob doesn't meet my requirements, I will consider selling to John."
