"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount above my minimum value of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also reflects the fact that the product is worth more to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and what the product is worth to Bob. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $9,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price than Bob's initial offer. It also leaves room for further negotiation in case Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,200 is just slightly better than selling to John. While it's still lower than my desired price, with only 6 rounds left, it's not worth risking further negotiation. There's a chance Bob won't budge further, and I risk losing a better deal."
