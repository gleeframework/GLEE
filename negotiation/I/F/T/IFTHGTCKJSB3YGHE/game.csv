"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from it.",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,450,000  represents a significant discount on its true worth.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to accept  $1,375,000. I believe this fairly accounts for both our interests.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,375,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that accounts for the product's value and my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a suitable price point. While $1,250,000 is a respectable offer, it falls short of reflecting the true value this product holds.  To bridge the gap, I propose a price of $1,310,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1310000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $1,250,000 is a fair price. I'm not willing to go above that. Can we meet at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Bob,6,
