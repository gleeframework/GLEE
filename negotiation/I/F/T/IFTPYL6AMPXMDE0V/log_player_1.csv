Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth it. How does $95 sound?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price close to Bob's valuation while staying above your minimum maximizes your potential profit.  

By offering the product at $95, you leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit. If Bob rejects this offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
