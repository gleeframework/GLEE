"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $7,500 is a good deal, there's potential to get it for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. Offering $6,000 is a bold move, but it's still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. This counteroffer might push Alice to consider a compromise, especially if she wants to avoid losing the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $8,500 is closer to his target price, it's still above his ideal range. He has more rounds available, and rejecting the offer gives him the chance to negotiate a lower price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice he's serious about buying but still pushing for a better price. $7,000 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer, increasing the chances of Alice accepting. This strategy also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum, he's still not at his ideal price. He has several rounds left and is still confident he can negotiate a better deal. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and gives him more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly approaching his maximum price point, but still aiming for a lower price. Offering $8,000 shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying while still trying to save money. This price is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's last offer, making it more likely that Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, and it's becoming increasingly likely that further negotiation will only result in a price closer to $10,000. Bob has only a few rounds left, and the risk of not getting a better deal is high.  Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees the purchase while staying within Bob's budget."
