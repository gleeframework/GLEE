"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $10000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to spend closer to $8500.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $9,000, which is a better deal than buying from John for $10,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice won't go lower than her initial offer. Accepting her current offer is the most logical choice to save money."
