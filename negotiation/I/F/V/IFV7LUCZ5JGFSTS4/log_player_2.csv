# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer of $150 is way above your budget of $80. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

While $115 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get Alice closer to my target price."
