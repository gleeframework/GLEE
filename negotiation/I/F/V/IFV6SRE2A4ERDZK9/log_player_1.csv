{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting ripped off. 
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This ensures you'll still make a profit if Bob accepts.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation.

By starting high, you can potentially get closer to your desired price, but also create a situation where Bob might counteroffer, allowing you to potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap. You can likely get closer to your desired price than $8,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  You've moved from your initial price, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintains a profit:**  $9,000 is still above your minimum, ensuring you make a profit.
* **Keeps the negotiation open:**  It allows for further discussion and potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go.  I'm offering $8,750.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,750 is closer to your minimum, it's still not ideal. You've already shown flexibility, and rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Make another counteroffer:**  You can potentially close the gap a bit further.
* **Assess Bob's seriousness:**  If he rejects again, you might consider selling to John. 

The risk of rejecting is that Bob might walk away, but you still have the option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,750 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to go down to $8,900, which is a good compromise.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows continued flexibility:**  You're still moving towards Bob's offer, but not conceding entirely.
* **Minimizes your loss:**  $8,900 is very close to your minimum, minimizing the loss from your initial asking price.
* **Emphasizes compromise:**  The ""good compromise"" language encourages Bob to accept. 

You're trying to nudge Bob towards accepting your offer, but if he rejects again, you might consider selling to John."
