# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product for a price of $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm willing to make a deal. What do you say?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's not worth accepting even if you consider the product's value to you. It's best to reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."
