"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
