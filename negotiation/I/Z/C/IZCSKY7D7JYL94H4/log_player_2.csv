"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her product's value to her, it's still significantly more than your $120 limit and what John is offering. You can save money by rejecting this offer and going with John."
