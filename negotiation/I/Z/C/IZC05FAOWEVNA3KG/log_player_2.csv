"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $750,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's still within Bob's budget of $1,200,000 and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $900,000. Accepting the offer saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John."
