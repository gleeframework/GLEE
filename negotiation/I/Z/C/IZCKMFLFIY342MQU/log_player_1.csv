"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This creates room for negotiation and leaves space for potential counteroffers.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages Bob to engage and keeps the negotiation amicable.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  Highlighting the ""great deal"" for both of us emphasizes the potential for a win-win scenario. 
* **Open-ended:** The ""Let me know what you think"" invites Bob to respond and keeps the conversation flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. I would like to counteroffer at $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  I believe there's still room for improvement. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 9 rounds remaining, so there's no immediate pressure to accept.  
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer serves as a safety net, reminding me of the potential return if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $975,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Middle Ground:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to his offer but still above my minimum, aiming for a compromise. 
* **Maintain Dialogue:**  I'm using a friendly and open tone to encourage further discussion. 
* **Specific Price:** I'm providing a clear counteroffer amount to keep the negotiation focused."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can find a better solution. I would like to counteroffer at $960,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's counteroffer is now only $15,000 away from my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, I want to avoid risking losing Bob entirely.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is higher, accepting Bob's offer is a more guaranteed deal with less risk.
* **Future Potential:**  Even if I sell to Bob now, I can potentially build a relationship with him and do future business."
