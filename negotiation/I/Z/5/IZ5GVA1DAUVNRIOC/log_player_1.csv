"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This should encourage Bob to engage and hopefully start a back-and-forth that leads to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, I'm still not comfortable with such a low price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I'm hoping to get at least $110-120, but I'm keeping John's offer as a backup in case things don't work out with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $115 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm offering a price that's still higher than what Bob initially offered, but it's also a significant reduction from my initial offer.  This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise, hopefully making Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that. Would you be willing to come down to $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a bit higher. I have a few rounds left, and I'm still hopeful of securing a better deal.  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I'm determined to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my last offer and Bob's current offer. This shows that I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm also emphasizing the benefits of closing the deal, hoping that Bob will be more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit above $110. Would you be willing to come down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob is not willing to budge much further, and I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price.  Rather than continuing to haggle and risk losing more time, I'm going to accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $150. This ensures I get a fair price for the product and avoids the risk of ending up with a much lower offer from Bob."
