"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiation, but I won't go below $900,000. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it's a good starting point for us to negotiate further.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $850,000 is significantly below what I need to get for this product. I'm prepared to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",900000.0,Alice,3,
