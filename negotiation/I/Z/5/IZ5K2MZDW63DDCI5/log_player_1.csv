"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it's really valuable, but I'm willing to let it go for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I think the product is quite valuable too, but I can only afford to pay up to $120. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is offering my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a better outcome. It's more strategic to sell to John at this point and avoid potentially wasting more time with Bob."
