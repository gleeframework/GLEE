Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and positive tone encourages Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting value:**  Emphasizing the product's value for Bob can sway him towards accepting.

**Strategy:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my next offer accordingly.
* I'll be prepared to make concessions, but I won't go below $9,000. 
* If the negotiation stalls or becomes unproductive, I'll sell to John for $10,000, ensuring I get my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your product's value, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $9,000.
* **Time efficiency:**  Accepting avoids further negotiation and potential delays.
* **Potential for better deals later:** While I could try for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing Bob and having to sell to John for $10,000 is too high. 

**Strategy:**

* This move secures a good price while minimizing risk and allowing me to focus on other opportunities."
