(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's maximum price, he still has a few rounds left to negotiate. Since he wants to save as much money as possible, he's not willing to settle for a price above what John is offering."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $152.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is only $2 less than what John is offering, and Bob only has 3 rounds left.  It's not worth risking further negotiation, as Bob might not get a lower price from Alice and he would be running out of time. He's better off buying from John and ensuring he gets the product."
