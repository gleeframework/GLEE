"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $825,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can close this deal in the next round.",825000.0,Bob,4,
