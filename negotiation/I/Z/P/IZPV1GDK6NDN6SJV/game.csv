"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is my best offer. This reflects the product's value, and it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I'm trying to stick to a tighter budget. Would you consider $8,750?  I think that's a fair compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $8,750 is still below my bottom line. Let's meet in the middle.  I'll offer you the product for $9,125. It's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",9125.0,Alice,5,
