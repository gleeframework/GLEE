"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's always better to start high and negotiate down. I'm starting at $2,000,000, which is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and potential to entice Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm using language like ""What do you think?"" to show I'm open to a conversation and willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for John:**  This initial offer is still far above John's offer of $1,500,000, so I'm not jeopardizing my backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $2000000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $800000. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. 
* **John is a safety net:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a viable option, giving me leverage to negotiate with Bob. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800,000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $1,700,000. This price still reflects the significant value of the product, but it's a more realistic figure based on your budget. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with justification:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but proposing a counter-offer that's closer to my minimum. I'm justifying this by acknowledging his budget and highlighting the product's value. 
* **Showing flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise, but not conceding too much. 
* **Focus on collaboration:** I'm using language like ""work together"" to emphasize a mutually beneficial outcome.

**This strategy aims to:**

* **Push Bob closer to my desired price:** This counteroffer is still above my minimum but shows I'm serious about selling to him. 
* **Keep John as a backup:**  I can still sell to John for $1,500,000 if this negotiation fails.
* **Maintain momentum:**  By continuing the negotiation, I'm showing Bob that I'm invested in a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product. This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, but I'm not ready to accept such a low offer. 
* **John is a safety net:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a solid backup plan if this deal falls through.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,250,000 is simply too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down further to $1,600,000. This price is a significant compromise on my end, but it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. Let's find common ground and close this deal.  "", ""product_price"": 1600000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with compromise:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to compromise further. My counter-offer of $1,600,000 is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Focus on a deal:** I'm emphasizing finding common ground and closing the deal.

**This strategy aims to:**

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1600000 is closer to what I can afford, it's still a stretch for my budget. I'm offering $1400000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to an agreement. Let's find a way to make this work.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000 for the product.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
