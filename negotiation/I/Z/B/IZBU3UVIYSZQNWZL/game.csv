"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  $2000000 is way outside my budget. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $800000. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $800000 is below my minimum acceptable price, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $1700000. This price still reflects the significant value of the product, but it's a more realistic figure based on your budget. Let's work together to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1250000 for the product. This would allow us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1250000 is simply too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down further to $1600000. This price is a significant compromise on my end, but it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. Let's find common ground and close this deal.  ",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1600000 is closer to what I can afford, it's still a stretch for my budget. I'm offering $1400000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to an agreement. Let's find a way to make this work.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $1400000 is still a bit too low for me.  Given your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to come down to $1450000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and your financial constraints.  Let's close this deal and make this work for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  $1450000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1425000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering your need to sell and my limited budget. Let's make this happen!",1425000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a limited budget, and we've been close for a few rounds. This is my final offer: $1475000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but it's also the absolute minimum I can accept.  It's a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value and your budget. Let's close this deal and make it happen!",1475000.0,Alice,9,
