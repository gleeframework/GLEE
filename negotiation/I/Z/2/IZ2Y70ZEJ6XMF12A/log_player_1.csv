Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe it's a more reasonable price considering my budget and the value I'm looking to get out of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit for me and a good deal considering John's offer of $800,000. I'm happy to close the deal at $1,050,000."
