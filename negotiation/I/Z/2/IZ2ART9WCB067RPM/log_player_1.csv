Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $13,000 is above your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  It's lower than Bob's estimated value of $15,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It's straightforward and invites a response from Bob. 

By starting with a slightly lower offer, you can potentially maximize your profit while still keeping the negotiation open. Remember, you can always counteroffer if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price around $11000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a better price.  I believe I can still get closer to my desired $13,000 by countering Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit closer to my original price.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000? It's still a good deal for you considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider $11500? It's a compromise between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,500 is getting closer to my desired price of $13,000.  While I can keep negotiating, there's a risk that he'll walk away or that I'll need to sell to John for $10,000. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids those potential losses."
