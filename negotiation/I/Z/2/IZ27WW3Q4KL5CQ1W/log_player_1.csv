Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident it's a win-win situation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, aiming for a good profit margin. I'm also emphasizing the win-win potential of this deal, hoping to encourage Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, so I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,600,000?  This still leaves room for a good profit for you, and it's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,500,000 I need to make it worthwhile. I'm going to keep negotiating and try to secure a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,300,000 is still significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to make one final concession - $1,450,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both be happy with.  If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,450,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm confident I could negotiate further, I don't want to risk losing more time.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, so I'll take that option."
