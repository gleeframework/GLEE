"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. It's priced at $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price of $130, which is a decent amount above my minimum and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and open to discussion.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $85.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $100?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering $100, which is still a good profit for me and hopefully more appealing to Bob.  I'm trying to be reasonable while also emphasizing the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $90.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground in the next round.  I'm still confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? This price is fair to both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm proposing $95, which is right in the middle of our last two offers.  This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.  I'm also reiterating that this price is fair and helps to emphasize the value of the product."
