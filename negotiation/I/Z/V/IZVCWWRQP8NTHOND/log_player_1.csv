"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message emphasizes the product's value and my belief that it would benefit Bob, creating a sense of desirability. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I explicitly state my willingness to discuss the price, signaling flexibility while maintaining control of the negotiation.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  If Bob accepts the initial high price, I've exceeded my goal.
* **Establish a Strong Position:** A high starting point gives me leverage in subsequent rounds.
* **Gather Information:** Bob's response will provide valuable insight into his willingness to pay and negotiating style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to buy it for $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both my minimum and his own stated value for the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially since Bob clearly sees the product's worth. Selling to John at this point would be a safe option, but I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This reflects the product's unique value while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** I've lowered my price by $200,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still significantly above Bob's offer, reinforcing the product's high value.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value to justify the higher price point and prevent Bob from anchoring the negotiation too low.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  By framing the counteroffer as a ""middle ground,"" I'm encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable offer in the next round. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maintain Leverage:** While showing movement, I'm staying firm on a price that represents a significant gain for me. 
* **Encourage a Counteroffer:** The significant reduction should incentivize Bob to counter with a more serious offer.
* **Avoid Stalemate:** By making a substantial move, I'm demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle.  How about $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, which shows he's willing to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still too far below my target, and I believe I can push him higher. We are early enough in the negotiation process to hold out for a better price.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a fair price. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects the significant value this product holds for you, while also recognizing our progress in this negotiation."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made another significant reduction of $150,000, demonstrating my willingness to make a deal. 
* **Anchoring Above $1 Million:** By staying firmly above the $1 million mark, I'm reinforcing the product's high value and my own minimum threshold.
* **Highlighting Progress:** I'm acknowledging Bob's movement and framing this as a collaborative effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain Momentum:**  Encourage Bob to continue raising his offer while showing I'm flexible.
* **Signal Bottom Line:** The reduced concession (compared to the previous round) subtly suggests I'm nearing my limit.
* **Prompt a Decision:**  With the price now closer to his valuation, Bob will need to seriously consider his options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to offer $900,000 to get this deal done.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now past the halfway point of the negotiation, and while Bob is steadily increasing his offer, $900,000 is still under my $1,000,000 minimum. Bob's language (""getting closer,"" ""get this deal done"") suggests increasing eagerness, which I can leverage.  I'll risk declining his offer and proposing a counter that signals a firm but potentially acceptable bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to find common ground.  I'm ready to close this deal, but the product's value is substantial. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000 - my final offer.  This is a very competitive price for something of this quality and potential."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my ""final offer,"" I create a sense of urgency and emphasize the need for Bob to act now.
* **Slight Concession:** The reduction to $1,050,000 shows flexibility but keeps the price firmly above my $1,000,000 minimum. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value and highlighting the competitiveness of this price, anchoring his perception above $1,000,000. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a Strong Deal:** The price represents a significant profit and meets my negotiation goals.
* **Avoid Prolonged Negotiation:**  With fewer rounds remaining, I want to push Bob toward a decision.
* **Leave Room for John:** If Bob rejects this offer, I still have the option of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
