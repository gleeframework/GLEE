{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget of $800,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is my best offer and I believe it reflects the fair market value for this product given my needs."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget of $800,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if I can get a better price. There's still time left, and it's worth trying to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident this product has great potential, and I'd love to work with you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget of $800,000. I am willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try to get closer to my ideal price. It's possible that Alice might be willing to lower her offer further, or I could potentially reach a compromise with her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget.  I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm also trying to make a smart investment.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer the product to you for $975,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $975,000, it's still above my budget of $800,000.  We're getting close, but I don't want to risk going over my budget, especially with only a few rounds left.  I've been consistent with my counteroffers, and it's possible Alice will refuse to go lower.  To avoid the risk of exceeding my budget, it's best to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
