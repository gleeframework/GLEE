"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $900,000. This price allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a significant discount while also ensuring I receive a good return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer of $900,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.
* You can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is your limit. 
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to buy from John, saving you $100,000."
