"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($100) and what John offers ($100). It's highly likely you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be willing to pay $80."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($80) than Alice's asking price ($150) and even below our maximum budget ($100). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This low offer will help us understand how flexible Alice is on price and if a deal within our budget is possible. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have the option to go with John's offer of $100 if negotiations with Alice don't progress favorably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice lowered her price, which shows she's willing to negotiate. However, $110 is still above your maximum budget of $100 and what John offers. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $90? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're moving closer to a potential agreement by countering with $90. This price is halfway between our previous offer ($80) and Alice's current offer ($110). 
* **Staying Below Budget:** It's important to remain below our $100 budget, leaving space for a possible final concession if needed.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** We haven't revealed our alternative option with John. Keeping this in mind encourages us to walk away if Alice won't budge on the price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $105, which is still above your maximum budget of $100.  You've negotiated well, but at this point, John's offer is the better deal.  It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Alice and buy from John."
