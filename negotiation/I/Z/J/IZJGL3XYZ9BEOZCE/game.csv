"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm offering you a new price of $10500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $10500 is a step in the right direction, I still believe we can reach a more equitable solution.

I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my financial limits.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the value you see in the product.

"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I value your product and understand its worth to you. However, based on my budget constraints and after careful consideration, I am unable to meet your latest offer at $11000. I would like to propose an offer of $10000. I hope this proposal allows us to come closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm offering you a new price of $10750. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",10750.0,Alice,7,
