"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counter offer. I'm willing to move a bit from my initial price, how about we settle at $1,025,000? This reflects some movement on my end while acknowledging the value you see in the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price, but I'm still a bit far from comfortable. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer, so how about we settle at $950,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $950,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $980,000. I believe this is a very competitive price and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal. What do you say?",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $980,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer, so how about we settle at $965,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",965000.0,Bob,6,
