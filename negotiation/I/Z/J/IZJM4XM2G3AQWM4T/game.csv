"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to get a good deal on the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950,000. This price should be more acceptable to both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
