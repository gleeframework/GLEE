"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $800,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more than the minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent offer, I want to see if I can push for a better price.  I'm going to reject and counter with my own offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,000,000. This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is a good compromise.  It's closer to my desired price, and I'm concerned that if I reject it, we might get stuck in a back-and-forth negotiation that could drag on.  Accepting this offer ensures a good profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
