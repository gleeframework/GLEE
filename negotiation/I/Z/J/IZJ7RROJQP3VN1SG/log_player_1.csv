I'm offering the product to Bob for $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it gives Bob a chance to get a potentially valuable product for a price that might still be less than its true worth to him. If he rejects the offer, I'm confident in selling it to John for $15,000."
