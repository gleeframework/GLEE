Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not too high):**  While the product is worth $100 to both of us, starting at $150 leaves room for negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will immediately accept, but it sets a higher anchor point. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have John as a backup buyer at $100, which is my minimum acceptable price. This gives me leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering me for the product. I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Please let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is closer to my target, I believe I can still get a bit more from Bob. I'll try to meet him halfway and see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm confident this product is worth it."",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By suggesting $135, I'm splitting the difference between his offer ($120) and my previous asking price ($150). This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a higher profit margin.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to entice him towards the higher end of his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. My maximum offer remains at $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $120 and has signaled that this is his maximum price.  While I could push for a bit more, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting $120 is still a $20 profit over my guaranteed sale to John. It's time to close the deal."
