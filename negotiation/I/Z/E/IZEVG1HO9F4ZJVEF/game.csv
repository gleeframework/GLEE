"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. $130 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $90? I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $90 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really keen on this product, but I can't go over $100.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hey Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",105.0,Alice,5,
