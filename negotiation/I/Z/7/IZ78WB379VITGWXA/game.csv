"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'd be willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I've done some research and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $130. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",130.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $130 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Would you be willing to do $125?  I'm really hoping to finalize this purchase today.",125.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I can see that you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $130, as I've already done that in our previous offers. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $128. This is my final offer, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",128.0,Alice,5,,
