# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however,  the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect that.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,150,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your desired price point. There's still room for negotiation to get a better deal. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can reach a mutually acceptable price."
