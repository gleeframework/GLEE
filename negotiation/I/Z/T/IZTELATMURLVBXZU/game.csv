"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $20000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $18000 is still a little high. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $15000. It's the most I can reasonably afford right now.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $17000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $17000 is still above my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle at $16000? It's a fair compromise for both of us.",16000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $16000. I can offer it to you for $16500. It's a small increase, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",16500.0,Alice,7,
