# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $1,500,000, which is more than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  You can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, which is within your budget. Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer."
