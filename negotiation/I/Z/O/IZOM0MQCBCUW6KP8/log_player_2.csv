"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I believe it's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer of $130 is less than your maximum budget of $150 and also less than buying from John for $150. This saves you money."
