"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's fair to both of us. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. This gives you a great deal, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and you have a backup option with John."
