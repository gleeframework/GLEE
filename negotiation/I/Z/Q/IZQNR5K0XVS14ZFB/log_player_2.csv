You're trying to save as much money as possible.  $110 is still too high, and you have room to negotiate. It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price again, but it's still not a deal-breaker. You're close to your maximum price of $120, but it's worth seeing if you can get a better price from Alice. You only have a few rounds left before you'll need to consider buying from John."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're running out of time, and this is likely your last chance to get a better price from Alice. This counteroffer is your maximum, but it's still lower than Alice's current offer. It's a risk, but you need to see if Alice is willing to meet you in the middle. If she rejects, you'll have to buy from John."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've reached the end of your negotiation with Alice.  Her final offer is $118, which is just $2 less than what John is charging. You've tried your best to negotiate with Alice, but you're running out of time and want to ensure you get the product.  While it would be ideal to get a lower price, buying from John guarantees you get the product without any further negotiation."
