{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Not Too High:** However, it's not too high that it would immediately be rejected and force me to go down too much.
* **Friendly Tone:** Using a friendly tone helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully sold the product at a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer based on my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* If the negotiation stalls, I can always switch to John, who is a guaranteed buyer at my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he has expressed interest. This suggests there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price through further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our desired prices. I'll likely offer a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $100 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This would still be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'd be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $120 is a compromise,  moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and shows a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Maintain Profit:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, ensuring I don't lose money on the sale.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message maintains a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, the sale is complete.
* If Bob rejects, I will analyze his next offer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Selling for that amount would result in a loss.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, indicating there's still room for a higher offer. 
* **John is a backup:** If this negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory price, I can always sell to John and guarantee my minimum profit.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still above my minimum.  I'll aim to close the gap and potentially secure a deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal.  While $110 is still a bit below what I can accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $115.  This is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** My counteroffer of $115 is a final compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach a deal.
* **Maintaining Profit:** This price ensures I don't lose money on the sale while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:** The message maintains a positive and encouraging tone to motivate Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, the sale is complete.
* If Bob rejects, I'll sell to John to guarantee my minimum profit. There's not much room for further negotiation at this point, and I'm not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **No Further Negotiation:** We have already gone back and forth several times, and Bob has shown a reluctance to budge from his desired price.  Further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a price that benefits me.
* **Guarantee Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $150, securing my desired profit and avoiding a potential loss.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to accept a price that's so far below my minimum.  Selling to John is the most logical and profitable decision at this point."
