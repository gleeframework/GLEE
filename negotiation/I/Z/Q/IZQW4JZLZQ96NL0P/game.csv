"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  Given my value for the product and the potential for further negotiation, I'd like to offer $750,000.  This allows for a healthy profit for you and a significant savings for me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Given the value to me and your own valuation, I think a price of $825,000 would be fair and allow us both to reach an agreement.  Let's make this deal happen!",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
