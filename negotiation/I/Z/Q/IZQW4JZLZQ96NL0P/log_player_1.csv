Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $950,000 is a bit high for me.  Given my value for the product and the potential for further negotiation, I'd like to offer $750,000.  This allows for a healthy profit for you and a significant savings for me.
