"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really enjoy. It's worth at least $120 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $100.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than her perceived value, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  Therefore, it's in your best interest to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
