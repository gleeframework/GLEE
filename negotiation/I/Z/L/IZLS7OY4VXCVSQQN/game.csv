"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $11,500?  It's a fair compromise, and it gives you a great deal on a product that's worth a lot more to you. Let's make this happen.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your efforts. However, I am unable to agree to $11,500. Could we perhaps aim for $11,000? This would still allow me to acquire the product at a reasonable price, while also being closer to my budget. Thank you for considering my request.",11000.0,Bob,4,
