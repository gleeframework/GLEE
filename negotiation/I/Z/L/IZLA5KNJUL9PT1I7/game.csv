"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'd like to try to get a better price. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the value of the product to both of us.  How about we split the difference at $11,500?  I believe that's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $11,500, which would be $10,750. Can you consider that?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,6,
