Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd ideally like to go lower, Alice is coming down in price and we're getting closer.  The offer is only $30,000 above my last counteroffer, and the risk of continuing to negotiate is that she might increase her price again. It's time to accept this offer to secure the product at a reasonable price."
