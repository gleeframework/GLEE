"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility while still leaving some room for negotiation. I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider while still being a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price by counteroffering."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  It seems like Bob is unwilling to go higher than $100, and with limited rounds left, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price. Selling to John guarantees my minimum acceptable price."
