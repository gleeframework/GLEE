Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals and Bob's situation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I know it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible. 
* **Secure the Sale:** Offering it at Bob's maximum value is risky, as he gains no immediate benefit. A slightly lower price makes it more appealing.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John will buy it for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't accept anything less than that.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** The message is framed to emphasize mutual benefit and fairness, encouraging Bob to accept.

**Why this price point?**

* $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 discount, a strong incentive to buy now.
* Alice secures a $150,000 profit, significantly more than John's offer. 

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Alice should be prepared to adjust within the range of $1,000,000 (her minimum) and $1,200,000 (Bob's maximum)."
