,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $80.50. It's my minimum price, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, though. I can offer it to you for $80.75. It's a compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",80.75,Alice,9,
