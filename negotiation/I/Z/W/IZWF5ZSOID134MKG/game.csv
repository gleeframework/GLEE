"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get from the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $2,050,000?  This reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial deal.",2050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get from the product.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
