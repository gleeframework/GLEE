"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant benefits it offers."", ""product_price"": 2300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the highest possible price, so we begin significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value and potential"" aims to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""a fair starting point"" signals to Bob that you're willing to negotiate. 

The goal is to anchor Bob's perception of the product's price high while leaving space for a deal that benefits you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly higher than his perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have room to negotiate further. Selling to John at this stage would be leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $2,050,000?  This reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 2050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** By decreasing your price to $2,050,000, you're demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still staying above your $1,500,000 minimum. 
* **Anchoring:** Aiming for the ""halfway point"" is a negotiation tactic to nudge Bob towards a higher number, even though the actual midpoint is lower. 
* **Positive Framing:**  Using phrases like ""mutually beneficial deal"" emphasizes finding common ground and building a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the negotiations could drag on, reducing your potential profit (due to the time value of money). 

Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
