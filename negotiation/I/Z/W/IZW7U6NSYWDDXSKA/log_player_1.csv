Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and our initial discussion.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,050,000 is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with him, and I'm not ready to settle for less than my minimum."

I'm willing to consider a final price of $1,075,000. This leaves room for negotiation but also ensures I'm not sacrificing too much."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

With only a few rounds left, Bob is not budging on his price.  It's getting very close to my minimum, but I'm not confident I can get him to accept my final offer.  I've already rejected his offer three times. I'd rather sell to John at $800,000 than risk getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum."
