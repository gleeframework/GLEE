Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than your maximum budget. This shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are also willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This leaves room for potential compromise and sets the stage for further negotiation."
