Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

This reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1700000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.
