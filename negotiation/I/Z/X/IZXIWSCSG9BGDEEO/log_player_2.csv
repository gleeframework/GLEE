"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can likely get a better deal than $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
``` 

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It signals that you're serious about buying the product, but are determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is now closer to what you're willing to pay. Accepting her offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John.  While there might be some room for further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal with Alice outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
