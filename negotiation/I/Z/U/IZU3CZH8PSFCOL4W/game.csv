"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial price. How about $16,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think!",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $15,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
