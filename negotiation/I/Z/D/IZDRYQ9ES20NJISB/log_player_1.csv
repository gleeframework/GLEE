"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using a positive and encouraging message to make Bob feel good about the offer and potentially more willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By starting at $10,000, I have room to lower the price if necessary, but still have a good chance of making a decent profit. 
* **Ready for counteroffers:** I'm prepared for Bob to counteroffer, which will allow us to continue negotiating and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's not worth selling to him at that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest.  $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a higher price:**  I'm counteroffering with $8,500, which is still below my ideal price of $12,000, but significantly higher than Bob's offer. 
* **Explaining the counteroffer:** I'm explaining my reasoning for the counteroffer to Bob by referencing the value of the product. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm still leaving some room for negotiation, indicating that I'm open to further discussion. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I won't lose out on significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,250 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I'm confident that I can get closer to my target price of $12,000 by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $7,250 is still a bit low for me.  Let's compromise at $8,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm reiterating that the price is fair and reflects the value of the product.
* **Keep the negotiation going:** I'm using a positive tone and asking for Bob's thoughts to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Still above minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on significant profit."
