Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (John), you start the negotiation significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification for the price:** You don't explicitly mention your minimum, but you imply the product's value exceeds Bob's perception by highlighting its ""value and potential.""
* **Urgency and scarcity:**  The ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" aim to nudge Bob towards a decision without giving him too much time to dwell on the high price.

**Goal:** This strategy seeks to:

* **Maximize profit:** Ideally, Bob accepts your offer, landing you a significantly higher profit than selling to John. 
* **Secure a quick sale:** Even if Bob counters, the offer sets the stage for a negotiation where you have the upper hand, knowing your fallback option is very strong."
