"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get Alice to come down on her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with a significantly lower offer, I'm aiming to establish a bargaining position that allows room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** My offer is closer to my maximum budget than Alice's starting price. This gives us space to meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first counteroffer will give me a better sense of Alice's flexibility and how low she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and still allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget but still above the $800,000 I can get it from John.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice's willingness to come down from $1,000,000 to $850,000 suggests she's open to negotiation. I believe I can get her closer to my target. 
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing I can buy from John for $800,000 gives me a strong bargaining position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can do. How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 700000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement:** This counteroffer shows Alice I'm serious about the purchase but still holding firm on my budget.
* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $700,000, I'm roughly splitting the difference between her last offer ($850,000) and my previous offer ($600,000).
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm staying below my walk-away price ($800,000 from John) to keep the pressure on Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about $900,000?  That's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice's latest counteroffer shows she's less willing to budge.  It's likely further negotiation won't yield a price significantly better than her current offer of $900,000.
* **John's Price is Better:**  It's no longer worth the risk of continuing the negotiation. I can secure the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John, which is a better outcome than Alice's current offer. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Alice takes time and effort. Buying from John provides a certain outcome at a better price, making it the most efficient choice at this point."
