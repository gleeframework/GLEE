Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect for both of us, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for further negotiation, allowing Bob to counteroffer if necessary. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've made a profit.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* If the negotiation stalls or I feel like I'm not getting a good price, I'll sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $600,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for better deal:**  While Bob is interested, he's clearly trying to get a bargain.  I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price, to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the value of the product and still allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Value:**  $850,000 is still above Bob's offer, but it's lower than my minimum acceptable price, allowing for some wiggle room.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive tone, emphasizing the potential for a ""good deal"" for both parties.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price, though still less than my ideal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make another counteroffer.
* If the negotiation stalls or I feel like I'm not getting a fair price, I'll sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can do. How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $700,000 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Significant gap:** There's still a significant gap between Bob's offer and my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I'm not in a rush to sell, knowing that I can get my desired price from John.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still willing to negotiate. I will aim for a compromise that benefits both of us."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  My counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, showing a genuine willingness to compromise.
