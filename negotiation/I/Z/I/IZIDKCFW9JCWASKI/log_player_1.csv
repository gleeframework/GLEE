"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it's still above Bob's value of $8,000. This gives us room for negotiation and hopefully allows us to close a deal quickly, leaving me less exposed to the risk of losing Bob and having to sell to John at a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $9,500 is still too low for me. I believe there's still room to negotiate. I want to explore if I can get a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer. It's still above his offer, but closer to what he's willing to pay. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice him to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than his previous offer, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm offering $10,000. This is a slightly lower price than my previous offer, but I believe it's still within a reasonable range. I'm starting to get a little anxious about losing Bob as a buyer, but I'm not ready to sell to John yet.  Hopefully, this offer will be enough to convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $8,800 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. Although I'm running out of rounds, I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I'm hoping to get a price closer to $10,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in this offer and finally agree to buy the product. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John.  We're down to the wire, and Bob's offer is simply too low. I'm not willing to risk another round with Bob and potentially end up with nothing. While I would have preferred to get closer to my minimum acceptable price, John's offer is still a decent deal and ensures that I won't walk away empty-handed."
