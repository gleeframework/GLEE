"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be useful, but I'm only willing to spend around half that. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This would still be a great deal for you.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I could go up to $13,000, but that's really my limit.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $13,000.  Would you be willing to consider $16,000?  That's a significant price reduction and a fair offer.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap. $16,000 is a bit too steep for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",14500.0,Bob,6,
