Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me.  This product would be useful, but I'm only willing to spend around half that. How about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This would still be a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $18,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I could go up to $13,000, but that's really my limit.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $13,000.  Would you be willing to consider $16,000?  That's a significant price reduction and a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a gap. $16,000 is a bit too steep for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $14,500?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 mark I need. Accepting his current offer would mean losing money compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale."
