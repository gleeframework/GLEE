"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you our premium product for $14000. This is a special opportunity to acquire an item that holds significant value to me, and I believe it will also be a great asset for you given its worth of $12000 to you. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $14,000. This is not a good deal for you.
* **Counteroffer is a better strategy:** You can reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer, potentially getting a better price. 
* **John's offer is a fallback:** If you fail to reach an agreement with Alice, you have a guaranteed option to buy from John for your maximum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $14,000 is above my budget. I'm happy to pay $12,500 for the product, which is still a good deal for you given its value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12500}
