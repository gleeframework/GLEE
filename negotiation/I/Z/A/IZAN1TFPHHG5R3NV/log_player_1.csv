{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is a decent price, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm going to try to get closer to my initial asking price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm offering $17,000 as a compromise. It's a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will convince him to accept, as it's closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is pretty close to my target price. At this point, it's more advantageous to close the deal with Bob than to risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
