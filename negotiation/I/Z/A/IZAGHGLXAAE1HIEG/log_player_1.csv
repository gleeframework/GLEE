It's time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  We've reached a point where the difference in each counteroffer is getting smaller.  Continuing to negotiate aggressively risks alienating Bob and could lead to a stalemate. 
* **Strong Profit:** $1,250,000 is a healthy profit margin above your minimum ($1,000,000) and a significant amount more than John's offer.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation means delaying receiving payment. Closing the deal now gets you the money sooner."
