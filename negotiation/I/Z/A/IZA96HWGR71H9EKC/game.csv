"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $8000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but based on my assessment, I am only willing to pay $8000 for it. I believe this aligns closely with the actual value I place on the product. I look forward to your response.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your assessment of its worth. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the compromise, I'm still unable to meet at $9500. I remain firm at my valuation of $8000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your understanding of its worth, and we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're still not meeting in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued efforts to find a mutually agreeable price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to lower the price. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $8500 for the product. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,6,

"I've gone as low as I can, Bob. I'm not willing to sell the product for $8500. I think I've already compromised enough. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000, but that's as low as I'll go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10000.0,Alice,7,
