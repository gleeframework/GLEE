"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $12500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13750. Let me know what you think.",13750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13750 is a bit closer, I'm still hoping to come in lower.  Would you be willing to accept $13000 for the product? It's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $13000 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",14000.0,Alice,5,
