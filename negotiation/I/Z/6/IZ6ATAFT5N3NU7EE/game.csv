"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $137.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go with $135. Would you be willing to accept that price?",135.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $135 is still just a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $136? I'm willing to meet you almost halfway on this one, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",136.0,Alice,5,
