"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $145. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $145, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" to entice Bob. 
* **Room for Counteroffers:** This price allows for a few rounds of counteroffers before I have to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $130. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I want to continue the negotiation to see if I can get a better price.  
* **Room for Improvement:**  There's still potential to reach a price closer to my desired $150 by continuing the back-and-forth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is just a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 137.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm countering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive language (""good deal,"" ""fair price"") to maintain a friendly tone.
* **Maintain Margin:**  While I'm lowering the price, I'm still maintaining a margin above my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $137.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go with $135. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Further Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can potentially get closer to my target price by continuing to counter. 
* **Time is a Factor:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to explore further counteroffers before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $135 is still just a bit too low for me. How about we compromise at $136? I'm willing to meet you almost halfway on this one, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 136}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Adjustment:**  I'm making a small adjustment upwards from Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Maintaining a Margin:**  While I'm lowering the price again, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, with only five rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise again, but $136 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and go with $133. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $133. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $133
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are in round 6, and only 4 rounds remain. 
* **Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $133 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited Upside:**  There's limited potential for Bob to increase his offer significantly in the remaining rounds. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired $150, ensuring a profitable transaction."
