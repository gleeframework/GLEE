"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $950,000.  What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, reflecting a fair value for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understanding of the value this product brings. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is below its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, which is a fair compromise and allows us both to move forward. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the inherent value of this product, and I respect your approach to this negotiation.  Let's make this happen - $887,500, and we have a deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
