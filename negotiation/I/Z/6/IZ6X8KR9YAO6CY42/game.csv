"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is a good starting point, I need to stay closer to my asking price to make this deal work. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000.  This price still offers you a good value, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand where you're coming from.  How about we settle at $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $750,000 still feels a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Alice,5,
