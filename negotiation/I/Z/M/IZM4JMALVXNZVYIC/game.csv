"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $90 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95?  I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still not willing to go as low as I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $92.50? That's the best I can do.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $92.50 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit more for the product. How about we settle at $94?  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $94, but I'm willing to meet you at $92. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Can you consider it?",92.0,Bob,6,
