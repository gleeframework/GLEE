,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about $9,500? This price still allows me some profit and is closer to your offer. Let me know if you're interested.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm able to spend right now.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000?  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
