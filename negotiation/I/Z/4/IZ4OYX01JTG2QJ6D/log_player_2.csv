{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about $9,500? This price still allows me some profit and is closer to your offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, he can still try to negotiate a better deal. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further.  He has a few rounds left to see if he can get closer to his $8,000 goal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm able to spend right now.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000?  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
