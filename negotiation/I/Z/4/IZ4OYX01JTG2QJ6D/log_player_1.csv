Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I believe I can do better with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,500 is simply too low.  I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about $9,500? This price still allows me some profit and is closer to your offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm able to spend right now.  Would you be willing to consider $9,000?  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,000 is a reasonable compromise and significantly closer to my desired value.  I'm accepting Bob's offer."
