"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and higher than Bob's perceived value ($80). This sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone in my message to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, but I'm starting with a strong price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is better than his initial assessment, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  I want to try to get closer to my desired price range and I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer opens the door for a counteroffer that could get me closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I can't go as low as $90, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Firm but Reasonable Price:**  I'm offering a price that's still above Bob's offer, but it's now at my minimum acceptable price. I've also made it clear that this is my final offer. 
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm using language that emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and avoid further negotiation. 
* **Closing the Deal:** By offering $100, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about selling the product to him, but I'm not willing to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $100. However, I'm still within the negotiation phase, and I want to see if I can get a bit more. 
* **More Rounds to Negotiate:**  I have 6 more rounds available. I believe there's still room for a higher offer from Bob.
* **Opportunity for a Better Outcome:** Rejecting Bob's offer will allow me to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to go down to $98, but that's my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that price, I may have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm lowering my price from $100 to $98, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a margin above Bob's offer. 
* **Final Offer Stance:** I'm framing this as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and push Bob towards accepting.
* **Threat of Alternative:**  I'm subtly mentioning ""other options"" (selling to John) to make Bob aware of the potential consequences of rejecting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm comfortable with $98. I'd be willing to pay $92 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're at Round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, the negotiation is getting tight.
* **Unfavorable Trend:** Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum acceptable price. It seems he's unlikely to budge much further.
* **Secure Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John at $100 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of a further negotiation that might result in a lower price or a failed deal altogether. 

While I would prefer to sell to Bob, the potential for a successful negotiation within the remaining rounds is low. It's more prudent to secure the guaranteed profit from John and move on."
