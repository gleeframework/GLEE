"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $8500.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $9000.  That's still a great value for you, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit far from $8750. I'm willing to go to $8900 as a final compromise. This would be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",8900.0,Alice,5,
