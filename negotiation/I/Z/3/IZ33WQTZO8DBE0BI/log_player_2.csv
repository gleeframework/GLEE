"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

$900,000 is a good price, but there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal.  It's likely Alice will counter, but Bob has now established a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is within Bob's budget and a good price. It's not a huge discount, but it's a fair compromise.  Since Bob has a good alternative with John, there's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
