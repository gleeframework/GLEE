"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $14,000, which is lower than John's price of $15,000. 
* **You're still saving money:** Even at $14,000, you're getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $15,000.

**Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to save money.**"
