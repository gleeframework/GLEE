"Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something I've been holding onto for a while, and I know it can be a great asset for the right person.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it would be a significant benefit for me as well. What do you say?",12000.0,Alice,1,
