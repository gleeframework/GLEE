"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $12,000 from Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's room for negotiation. A counteroffer of $10,000 is a significant reduction from her initial $12,000 price, but still allows for a potential profit for her. This should encourage her to consider accepting while still saving you a substantial amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still a good deal for you, considering your maximum budget is $15,000 and you can get it from John for that price. It's also a better price than your previous counteroffer of $10,000. Accepting this offer saves you $3,500 compared to buying from John."
