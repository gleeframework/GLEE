{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $15,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $11,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and hopefully, a starting point for further negotiation."

$13,500 is still too high. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm offering $12,500, which is a compromise between my maximum and her last offer. Hopefully, we can reach a deal here."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800.

Alice is getting closer, but I've already had 6 rounds of negotiation, and I'm unlikely to get a better price. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $12,000."
