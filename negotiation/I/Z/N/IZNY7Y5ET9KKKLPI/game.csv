"I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget constraints. However, $10,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,250? This allows us both to get a good deal, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to try to get closer to my target. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
