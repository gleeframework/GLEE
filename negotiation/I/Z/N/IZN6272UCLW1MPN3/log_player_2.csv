"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it gives us both room to make a deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget.** While it's a lower price than the initial offer, it's still $1,000 over what Bob is willing to pay.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open.**  Bob has already shown he's willing to negotiate, and Alice has demonstrated flexibility. This could lead to a more favorable price in the next round.
* **Buying from John is still a viable option.**  Bob could purchase from John for $15,000, but it's worth continuing the negotiation with Alice to see if they can meet his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still only able to offer $15,000. That's my absolute limit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
