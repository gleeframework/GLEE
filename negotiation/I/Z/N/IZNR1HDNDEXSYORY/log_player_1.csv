Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a nice product, but $140 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
