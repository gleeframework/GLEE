"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a very interesting product. However, I'm not sure I can justify $1500000 at this moment. Would you be willing to consider $1200000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has significant value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However,  $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $1250000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
