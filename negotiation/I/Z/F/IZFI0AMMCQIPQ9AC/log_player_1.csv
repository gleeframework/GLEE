Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is $20,000, it implies the product has value beyond $15,000, potentially due to exclusivity or other factors. 
* **Alternative:**  By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly remind Bob he's not the only potential buyer, creating a sense of urgency. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You know you have John as a backup, but securing a higher price from Bob is the optimal outcome."
