"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value but not so high as to immediately deter Bob.  I'm hoping to get a good deal, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm happy with $12,000, I'm going to try and see if I can push for a higher price.  There's still a chance that Bob will be willing to pay more, and I have 8 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but I still believe the product is worth more than Bob's current offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell for that price yet. I still have a few rounds left and I want to see if I can get a bit more.  I'm not too worried about John as his offer is only $500 higher than Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $12,500. This is a significant drop from my last offer, but it's still higher than Bob's current offer. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price and with only 4 rounds remaining, I don't want to risk losing the deal."
