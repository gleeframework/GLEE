"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  It's a fair compromise and still gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking $9,000 is a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm prepared to walk away from this deal if we can't find common ground. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  How about we settle on $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in making this deal happen.",10000.0,Alice,5,
