"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport.
* **Focus on value:** I'm emphasizing the potential benefit to Bob, making him consider the value proposition.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation.  I'll be prepared to adjust the price based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation.  I'll also keep in mind my fallback option of selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's room for negotiation. Bob is showing interest, so there's a chance we can reach a mutually acceptable price in future rounds. 
* **John as a backup:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John for a much higher price, giving me leverage in the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions.  If we can't find common ground, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500?  It's a fair compromise and still gives you a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $12,000 to $10,500. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""split the difference"" approach, making the offer seem reasonable.
* **Continued focus on value:**  I'm still reminding Bob of the value proposition, even as I compromise.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation closer to my desired outcome.  If Bob accepts, I get a decent price.  If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate, keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking $9,000 is a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While he's showing a willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Remaining rounds:** I have several rounds left to negotiate. It's worth pushing for a better price.
* **John's offer as leverage:** I have a backup buyer offering $15,000, which gives me a strong negotiating position.

**Strategy:**

I'll make a final counteroffer in the next round, aiming to increase the price closer to my desired range. If Bob remains unwilling to budge, I'll proceed to sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm prepared to walk away from this deal if we can't find common ground. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  How about we settle on $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in making this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing that this is my final counteroffer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Bob to accept.
* **Compromise (again):**  I'm making a slight concession, moving down from $10,500 to $10,000, demonstrating my willingness to find a solution.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm still reminding Bob of the product's worth and the potential benefits to him.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is my last attempt to reach a deal with Bob. If he rejects, I'll sell to John in the next round, securing my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,800 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Few rounds left:** We only have four rounds remaining, and there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Selling to John ensures I get my desired price without any further risk or negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed sale with John for a much higher price.  I'll secure the best possible deal by selling to John."
