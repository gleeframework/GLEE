Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a price that is higher than my guaranteed minimum of $1,200,000 from John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  By aiming for a higher price, I have the potential to earn more than John's offer.
* **Risk/Reward:** While there's a risk Bob might reject the offer, I'm willing to take that chance for a potentially larger payout.
* **Negotiation Space:** Starting at a higher price allows room for negotiation if Bob is interested but wants a lower price.

**Important Note:** This offer is based on limited information about Bob's value of the product. A more sophisticated strategy would involve researching Bob's financial capabilities and potential interest in the product."
