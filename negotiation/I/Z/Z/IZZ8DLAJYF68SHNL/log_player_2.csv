Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my original price.  I'm proposing $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a great value for you.
