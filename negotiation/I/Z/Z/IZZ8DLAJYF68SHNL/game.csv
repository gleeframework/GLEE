"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my original price.  I'm proposing $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents a great value for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm excited about the possibility of working together.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
