{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $180 is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation while ensuring you're above your minimum value.
* **Friendly tone:**  A positive message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Open-ended question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation process.

**Important Note:**  This is just an initial offer. You will need to adapt your negotiation strategy based on Bob's responses and your understanding of his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible for us to negotiate a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum:**  While $120 is your minimum acceptable price, it's still a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** Bob's initial interest and willingness to negotiate suggest there's a chance he's willing to pay more. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to maintain some leverage in the negotiation. You can counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $120, testing the waters for a potential compromise. 

**Next steps:**  You will need to make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price higher than $120 but still within a range you believe Bob might accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $150? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromising while maintaining value:**  $150 is a significant drop from your initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above your minimum value.
* **Highlighting the product's value:** Emphasizing the product's quality reinforces the value proposition.
* **Positive tone:** A friendly and encouraging message maintains good rapport.

**Strategy:**  This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise. If he rejects it, you can continue negotiating, potentially moving closer to your minimum price. If he accepts, you'll have secured a price closer to your initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  $130 is only $10 above your minimum price.  While tempting, accepting it would mean you're earning very little profit.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob has shown flexibility and is clearly interested in the product.  There's a chance you can secure a price closer to $150 with a well-crafted counteroffer.
* **Maintaining control:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially drive the price up further.

**Next steps:**  You'll need to send a counteroffer that's slightly higher than $130, aiming to find a compromise point where you both can agree.  Consider offering something like $140, highlighting the value and potential benefits of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence! Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $140. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with your purchase."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Offering $140 splits the difference between your previous offer and Bob's current offer. 
* **Positive reinforcement:**  Using phrases like ""fair price"" and ""confident you'll be happy"" reinforces the value and emphasizes a win-win scenario.
* **Closing the deal:**  This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise, potentially pushing Bob to accept. 

**Strategy:**  This counteroffer is a strong compromise that keeps you above your minimum price while still being attractive to Bob. If he rejects it, you may need to reconsider your position and either accept his offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on a price of $135 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the minimum:**  $135 is only $15 above your minimum price. This means you'll be making a small profit, which is better than nothing.
* **No room for further negotiation:** Bob has shown a clear budget limit and has already made concessions. It's unlikely you'll be able to push the price higher.
* **Avoid risking time and effort:**  Continuing the negotiation could potentially take more time and effort without a guarantee of a better outcome. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and relatively favorable sale. 

**It's important to weigh the potential profit with the time and effort required for further negotiation. In this case, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most sensible option.**"
