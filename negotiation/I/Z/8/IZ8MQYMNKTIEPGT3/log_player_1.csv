Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation while still giving Bob a good deal.  I'm also trying to create a positive relationship by framing it as a win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is above my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great value for you considering the product's worth. Let's try to find a middle ground. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $10,500. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is closer to my ideal price, it's a good deal for me considering that I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price and Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate. Further negotiation might be possible, but it risks delaying the sale and potentially losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer is the best option to secure a sale at a reasonable price."
