"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, the price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you consider a lower price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you consider $11,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can offer you a compromise at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
