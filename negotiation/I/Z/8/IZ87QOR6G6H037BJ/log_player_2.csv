Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I can offer you a compromise at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At $13,000, we're getting close enough to my budget, and further haggling might make Alice less willing to negotiate. It's better to secure a reasonable price now than risk losing the deal."
