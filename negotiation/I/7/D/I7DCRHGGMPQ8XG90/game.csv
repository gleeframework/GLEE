"Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product has significant value, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,600,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
