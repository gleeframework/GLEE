"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",8000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $8,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $7,500. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  $7,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $6,800.  Would that price point work for you?",6800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're getting close to your target, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $7,200. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",7200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very accommodating, and I appreciate that.  I'm ready to close this deal, but $7,200 is a bit too high for me.  My final offer is $7,000.  Let me know if that works for you â€“ I'm ready to buy if it does!",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $7,100. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need you to meet me at $7,100. Can you do that?",7100.0,Alice,7,
