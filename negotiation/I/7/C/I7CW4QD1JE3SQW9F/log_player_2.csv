"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offers and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,000.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's original price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  It's also a price that's still within my budget, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than her initial offer and still within my budget.  Further negotiation might be possible, but accepting this offer secures the product at a good price without risking further negotiation rounds."
