"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I've done my research, and I believe the product's value to you is higher than $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable considering the product's worth to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $1550000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my own profit margins.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
