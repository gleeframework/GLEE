"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and would allow me to make a profit. Can we meet in the middle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a better deal. I'm confident that I can negotiate a price closer to $1,000,000 in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $975,000, which is a good compromise and allows us both to make a profitable deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be more aggressive. Can we discuss $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my ideal price, I'm not ready to settle for that yet. I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $950,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be more aggressive. Can we discuss $920,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $920,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm confident that I can get a better price in the next few rounds.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a price closer to $950,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which is a significant compromise and reflects the value of this product. This is my final offer before I consider other options. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 940000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $940,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can we discuss $915,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is getting too close to the point where I'm risking losing too much money.  While I'm confident that I could likely negotiate a higher price with Bob in future rounds, it's getting too risky.  I've had a good negotiation with Bob, and he's shown a clear willingness to make a deal, but I need to secure a reasonable profit.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
