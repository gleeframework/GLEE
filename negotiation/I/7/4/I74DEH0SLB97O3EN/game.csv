"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value and my current financial constraints, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This represents a significant investment for me and a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,900,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm committed to finding this product, but I'm sticking to my limit of $850,000. If you're not able to reach that price, I'll have to explore other options. ",850000.0,Bob,4,
