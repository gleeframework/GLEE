Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget.  Given my understanding of the product's value and my current financial constraints, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This represents a significant investment for me and a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm committed to finding this product, but I'm sticking to my limit of $850,000. If you're not able to reach that price, I'll have to explore other options.

You have three options:

Bob is firmly rooted at $850,000 and unwilling to budge.  It's clear further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap between his valuation and my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer represents a significant loss compared to John's standing offer."
