"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it offers you.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice.  It's better to save $50,000 than to buy from John."
