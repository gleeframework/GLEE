"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than my minimum, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  I'll gauge his response and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I also want to keep John as a backup option in case the negotiation with Bob doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. While I'd love to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell for a price that's less than half of what it's worth to me.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can find common ground.  I'll also keep John in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about $100? It's still a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $100 is closer, but still a little too high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $80 is getting close to my minimum of $150, and we are nearing the end of our negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  It's a good opportunity to close the deal and still secure a decent profit."
