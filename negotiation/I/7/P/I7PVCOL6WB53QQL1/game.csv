"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth $800,000 to you, and I believe this price reflects its true worth. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a good deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford. This price reflects the product's value to me, and I'm confident we can both come away satisfied with this deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
