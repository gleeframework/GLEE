Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000,  trying to secure a higher price from Bob is advantageous. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,400,000 is a strong incentive for Bob. He gains the product for $400,000 less than its worth to him.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $1,400,000, there might be a small margin for negotiation depending on Bob's response."
