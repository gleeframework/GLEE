"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. There are still 8 rounds remaining, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'm not willing to settle for John's offer yet, as I see the potential for a higher return with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, I'm looking for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I can meet you at $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now at $9,000. This is significantly closer to my desired price range and still allows me a decent profit. Given that we're already at Round 4, it's risky to keep pushing for more. If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be forced to sell to John for a significantly lower price. It's a good time to close the deal and secure a solid profit."
