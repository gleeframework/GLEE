"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to someone with the right vision. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. This is a one-time offer and I'm confident you won't regret taking advantage of it. ",1500000.0,Alice,1,
