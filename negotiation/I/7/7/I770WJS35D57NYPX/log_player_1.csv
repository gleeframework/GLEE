Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives room for negotiation. 
* **Positive messaging:** I'm framing the message in a way that highlights the potential value for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm not setting a hard line, leaving space for Bob to counter. 

**Strategy:** I'm hoping that Bob will accept my initial offer.  If he doesn't, I'll be ready to adjust my price based on his counteroffer, keeping in mind my own minimum acceptable price and the possibility of selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.** While closer than his initial value, I'm not willing to accept it yet. 
* **I have a strong alternative.** Selling to John for $120 gives me a guaranteed return that is higher than Bob's offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially close the gap towards my desired price. 

**Strategy:** I will counter with a price closer to $100, aiming to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us. If Bob doesn't accept my counteroffer, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  I'm willing to go down a bit, but $90 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $95?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the proposed price to increase the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Maintaining a higher price:** I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but I'm willing to negotiate further.

**Strategy:** I hope this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects it, I'll have to weigh the potential for further negotiation with the guaranteed $120 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $95 is a bit out of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That way, I can get a good deal and you can still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.** While closer than his previous offers, I'm not willing to accept it yet. 
* **I have a strong alternative.** Selling to John for $120 gives me a guaranteed return that is higher than Bob's offer.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited.** Bob has already rejected my counteroffer, and further negotiation might not lead to a better outcome.

**Strategy:**  I'm choosing to sell to John because it offers me a certain profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob. There's a good chance I won't be able to reach a price that's worth my time and effort with Bob."
