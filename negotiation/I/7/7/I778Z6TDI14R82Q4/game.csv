"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget of $10,000.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
