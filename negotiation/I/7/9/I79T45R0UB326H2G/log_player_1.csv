Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000.  This gives me a good margin above my minimum, but it's also within a range that Bob might be willing to consider, especially if he values the product highly. I'll be watching his response carefully to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it just yet. I believe the product has a higher value, and I want to explore the possibility of getting closer to my initial price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,350,000. This is still a good amount above my minimum, and it shows flexibility while maintaining a negotiating position.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise.  While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than my minimum and closer to my initial offer. Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and secure a decent profit. Selling to John at $1,200,000 would be a lower return, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
