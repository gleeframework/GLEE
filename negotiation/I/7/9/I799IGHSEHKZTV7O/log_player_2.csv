"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. There's a good chance she's willing to negotiate, and I might be able to get the product for less.  Since John's offer is my maximum, I have room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $120 is a reasonable starting point, given my maximum budget of $150.  This offer shows I'm serious about buying the product but also signals I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
