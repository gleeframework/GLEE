"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $12,500, which reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think $12,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet halfway and settle on $11,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's trying to stay well below my minimum acceptable price. At this stage, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob, which might not even get me a better deal."
