Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $1,093,750 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle one more time at $1,103,125.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,103,125 is getting closer, but let's land this. How about $1,098,437?  I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price is fair given its value.
