"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about $900,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can agree on a fair price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a significant investment. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
