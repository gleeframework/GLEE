{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets a high starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
