"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $1,250,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,125,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is my absolute minimum.  Let's close this deal at this price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
