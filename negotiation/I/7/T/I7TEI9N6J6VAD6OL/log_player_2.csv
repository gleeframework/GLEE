This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice is signaling a hard limit:** Her language (""final offer,"" ""selling to John"") suggests she's not budging further.
* **The price difference is small:** Holding out for another $5,000-$15,000 isn't worth the risk of her walking away, leaving you to pay John's $1,000,000 price. 
* **You've negotiated well:** You've gotten the price down significantly from her initial offer."
