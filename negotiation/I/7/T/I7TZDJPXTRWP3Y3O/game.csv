"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too far below my minimum asking price.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll accept $1,300,000 for the product. This price still provides me with a fair return and gives you a significant discount. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
