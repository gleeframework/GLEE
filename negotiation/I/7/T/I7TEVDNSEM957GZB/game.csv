"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160?  This would still give us both a good deal.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. While $160 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $140 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $145? This would be a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $145 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle on $137.50?",137.5,Bob,6,
