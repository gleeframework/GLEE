"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $145 for it. Let me know what you think!",145.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $145 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to go down to $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $138. This is a great deal for a product you'll love, and it's closer to my minimum price. What do you say?",138.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $138 is still a little more than I'm able to spend at the moment. I'm willing to pay $135. Let's see if we can strike a deal here.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! How about $137? I'm really trying to work with you here, but I need to stay above my minimum price. This is a one-time offer, let's make this happen.",137.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still a little over my budget at $137.  How about we meet in the middle at $136? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",136.0,Bob,6,
