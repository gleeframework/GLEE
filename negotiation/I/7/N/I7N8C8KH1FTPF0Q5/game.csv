"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your input and understand your perspective. While we aim to be accommodating, the product comes with certain exclusivity and features that justify its original price. I would like to respectfully counter your offer with a price of $8000. This still allows for a reasonable profit margin while acknowledging your valuation of the product. I look forward to your consideration.",8000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price.
