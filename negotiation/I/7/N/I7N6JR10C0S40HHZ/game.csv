"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering my initial offer of $12,000.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad to see we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'll meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,750. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation.",10750.0,Alice,5,
