"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth more than $8,000 to me. Considering its significance to you, valued at $15,000, I propose a fair deal. Let's aim for a price that respects both the product's worth and your budget. How about $12,000? This offer allows us to meet in the middle, ensuring you get a great value while maximizing my return. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is a starting point.  While her message tries to frame $12,000 as a compromise, it's still significantly above her own valuation of the product. 
* By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a price closer to your perceived value. 
* You have the fallback option of John at $15,000, so you're not at risk of losing the product entirely. 

**It's highly likely that Alice will return with a counter-offer lower than $12,000, giving you a chance to save more money.**"
