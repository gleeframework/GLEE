"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing you to still make a profit while enabling me to acquire the product within my financial constraints.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the $1,100,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This offer represents a significant reduction on my part while still acknowledging the product's worth. Let me know what you think.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're still holding out for a higher price, but $1,450,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer. This price reflects a significant compromise from both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you still receive a profitable return. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement at this point.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
