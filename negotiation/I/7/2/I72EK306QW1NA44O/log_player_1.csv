Bob's offer:

This price reflects a fair compromise, allowing you to still make a profit while enabling me to acquire the product within my financial constraints.  Let me know your thoughts.

Bob's offer:

I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer. This price reflects a significant compromise from both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you still receive a profitable return. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement at this point.
