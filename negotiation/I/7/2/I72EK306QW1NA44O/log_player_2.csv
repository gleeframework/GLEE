"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,600,000 vs. $1,000,000).  It's in Bob's best interest to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a clear opportunity to save a significant amount of money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the $1,100,000 price point doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This offer represents a significant reduction on my part while still acknowledging the product's worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's budget and the price he's willing to pay.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his target. It's still worthwhile to attempt further negotiation before resorting to buying from John."

I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer. This price reflects a significant compromise from both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you still receive a profitable return. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
