"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob's value for the product is unknown. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I also know I have a safety net with John, who is willing to pay my minimum price. This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while also minimizing risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this stage. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,750,000, which is still above my minimum price and hopefully more appealing to Bob than his last offer. I'm trying to find a compromise while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer a higher amount, accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids further negotiation rounds. Selling to John would only net me $100,000 more, but the risk of losing the deal completely is too high at this point."
