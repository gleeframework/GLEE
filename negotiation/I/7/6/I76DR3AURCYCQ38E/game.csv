"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer to my price range.  To be honest, I have other options I'm considering, so I'd need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make a deal work. How about it?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you have other options, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,180,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1180000.0,Alice,5,
