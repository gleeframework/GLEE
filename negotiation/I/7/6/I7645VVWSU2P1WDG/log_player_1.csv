```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it gives me room to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I want to see if he's serious about buying and what his perceived value is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to counteroffer with a higher price, hoping to get closer to my initial target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me halfway, as it's closer to his offer than my previous one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll make another counteroffer, but if he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,850,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer but still above Bob's current offer. This is my last attempt to get closer to my desired price. If Bob rejects, I'll accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value. It's clear he's not willing to pay closer to my desired price, so I'm going to accept John's offer to avoid any further negotiation.  While I'm not getting my ideal price, it's better than risking a lower price or a prolonged negotiation process."
