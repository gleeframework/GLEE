Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Staying Below Bob's Value:** By offering the product at $115, it's still $5 cheaper than what Bob values it at, making it a potentially attractive offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob counters, there's space to negotiate downwards, closer to your minimum acceptable price of $100, while still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $110?  That's still a good price for you and a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $110 is still a $10 profit for you. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk:

* **Bob Might Walk:**  There's no guarantee Bob will go higher. If you reject this offer, he might decide it's not worth the hassle and walk away.
* **John's Offer Is Safe:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a $10 profit, which is better than the $0 profit you'd make if Bob walks and you sell to John. 

It's generally better to take a sure profit than risk ending up with nothing."
