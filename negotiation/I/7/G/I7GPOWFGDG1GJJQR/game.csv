"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's meet somewhere in the middle, how about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could you consider coming down a little further to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still too low for me to consider. This product is worth a significant investment, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return. How about we settle on $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
