"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'd be interested in continuing the negotiation if you're open to a figure closer to my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,300,000 represents a fair assessment of the product's value, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to facilitate a deal. This offer reflects my strong desire to see this product in your capable hands.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still considerably outside my budget.  To be realistic, I can't go any higher than $700,000.  If that's not workable, I might need to explore other options.",700000.0,Bob,4,
