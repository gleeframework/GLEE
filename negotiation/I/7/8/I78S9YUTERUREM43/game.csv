"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price, as it's still below my original asking price and closer to the value it holds for you. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000.  Would you be open to that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This is a good compromise, and it's still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,5,
