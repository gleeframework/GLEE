"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 represents a fair price for its value, I understand your position. I could come down to $10,000, but that's my absolute lowest.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $10,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
