Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first for $119.  I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, but still nets you a higher profit than your guaranteed sale.
* **Strategic Messaging:** By mentioning you're offering it to Bob ""first,"" you subtly create a sense of scarcity and potential loss if he doesn't act.

It's important to note that there's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. However, this strategy maximizes your potential profit while still offering Bob a price that might be tempting enough given his perceived value of the product."
