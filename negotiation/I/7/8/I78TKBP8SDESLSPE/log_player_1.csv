"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see how Bob values the product and gauge his interest before moving lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can get closer to my target with further negotiation. I'm going to counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counter-offering at $135. This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still pushing for a price closer to my initial goal.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $125 is a decent profit and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. I don't want to risk losing the sale and getting stuck with the lower price from John."
