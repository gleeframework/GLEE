Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $100 as possible, my minimum acceptable price.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $80, so I need to offer a price that's attractive but doesn't leave too much money on the table.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John gives me leverage. 
* **Slight Discount Psychology:** Offering $99 instead of $100 might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal, even though it's just a dollar difference. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer palatable enough for him to accept."
