"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to start our negotiation. I think my product is a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. Let's start with a price of $1,800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the value you see in your product, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, as I believe it aligns with its true market value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is your budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $1,600,000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but closer than before. I'll reject and counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my target price.  John is a good backup option, but I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair value for the product. I believe this is a good compromise and hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,400,000 is still a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my maximum budget. This is a good deal for me, as I can get the product for my desired price without risking further negotiation. While I could try to counteroffer for a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice would accept, and I could potentially lose the deal. Buying from John for the same price is a viable option, but this deal offers the possibility of securing the product directly from Alice."
