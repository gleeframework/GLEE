"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better price through counteroffers before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still a bit high.  There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better price. You'll try to negotiate further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1,075,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go to $1,060,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1060000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,060,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,065,000. This offer reflects the value of the product and is fair to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now only $65,000 over your budget, it's still a risk. You've already made several counteroffers, and it's unclear if further negotiation will get you a lower price. Given the limited rounds and the certainty of John's offer at your budget, it's safer to take the guaranteed deal with John."
