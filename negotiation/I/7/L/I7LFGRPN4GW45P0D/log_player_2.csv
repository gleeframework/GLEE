"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $20,000 to start the conversation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

This offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it could be useful, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 to start the conversation. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Starting significantly lower than my actual budget ($8,000) allows room for negotiation. This strategy aims to bring Alice closer to a more reasonable price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident you'll see a return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is coming down, but $14,000 is still significantly higher than both my budget and John's offer. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $14,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Could we consider a price closer to $6,500? I believe that would be a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying well below my $8,000 maximum.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $6,500, I'm aiming for a price roughly in the middle of our current positions ($14,000 and $5,000).  This can signal a desire to find a compromise.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** It's important to remember that I have John's offer of $8,000 as a backup. I don't want to appear desperate to make a deal with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I understand the need for compromise. How about $11,000? This offer reflects the product's true value while hopefully fitting within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is slowly moving closer to a more reasonable price, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I need to hold firm and see if she's willing to go lower. I'm getting closer to my backup plan with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for continuing this discussion. I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget for this is $8,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to agree to a deal today."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm revealing my maximum budget to signal that this is my final offer. This emphasizes that I'm serious about the purchase but have a firm limit.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning ""agreeing to a deal today,"" I'm subtly introducing a time constraint, potentially pushing Alice to make a decision.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  Alice now knows my limit. I'm prepared to walk away and buy from John if she doesn't accept this offer."
