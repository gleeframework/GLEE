"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it could be useful, $20,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 to start the conversation. What do you think?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $5,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident you'll see a return on this investment.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, $14,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Could we consider a price closer to $6,500? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",6500.0,Bob,4,
