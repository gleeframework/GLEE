"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $12,500 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $13,250? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider this offer?",13000.0,Bob,4,
