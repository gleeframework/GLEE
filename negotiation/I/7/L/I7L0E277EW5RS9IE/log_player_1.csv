Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you acknowledging the value of the product to me. However, $12000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10500 for it. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my own budget constraints. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
