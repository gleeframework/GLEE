"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $15000. I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $12,000 is above Bob's desired price range.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer at a lower price, potentially saving more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is a compromise that takes into account the value of the product to you and my own minimum price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's new offer of $11,500 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's within his budget of $15,000. 
* Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there's no guarantee.  
* Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a price lower than John's, minimizing his risk of a stalemate and potentially saving more money in the long run."
