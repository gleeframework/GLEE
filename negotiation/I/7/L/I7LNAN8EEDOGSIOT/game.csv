"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and quality.",108.0,Alice,5,
