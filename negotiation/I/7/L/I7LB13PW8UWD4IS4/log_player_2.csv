"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for less than $12,000.  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above the $10,000 value to Alice. This makes it a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is a bit higher than Bob's previous offer, it's still lower than the $15,000 price from John.  There's still room for negotiation to try and get a better price.  Bob should continue to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round. This shows he's willing to negotiate but is still trying to get a better deal than Alice's latest offer. It's a reasonable middle ground that might be acceptable to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still below the $15,000 price from John, making it the best option for Bob.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal or that Bob will run out of time and have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the current offer is the most logical choice for Bob."
