Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm looking to sell it for $15,000.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer ($15,000) allows you to potentially gain more than your minimum acceptable price ($12,000). 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, there's a slim chance Bob might counter-offer, giving you space to potentially settle closer to $15,000.
* **Strong Stance:** The ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach creates a sense of urgency and emphasizes your confidence in the product's value.

**Important:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer. You have a guaranteed backup buyer (John) at your minimum price, mitigating the risk."
