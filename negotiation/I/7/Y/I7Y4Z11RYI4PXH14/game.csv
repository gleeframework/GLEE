"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $7,000, so I'm counteroffering at $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
