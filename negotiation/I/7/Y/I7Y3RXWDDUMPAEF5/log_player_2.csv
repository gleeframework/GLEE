"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $12,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** You can always purchase from John if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering it for $11,500.
* **The price is reasonable.**  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't budge much more, and you risk losing the deal. 
* **Buying from John is still an option.**  You have a backup if you want to continue negotiating, but this seems like a good price."
