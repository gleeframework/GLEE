"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $900000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for $1050000 to make this deal work.  It's a significant investment for me, and this price allows me to cover my costs.  I'm confident this product will be a great asset for your business, and I'm happy to discuss it further.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
