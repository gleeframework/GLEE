"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe you'll find it's well worth the price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and also higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This sets the tone for negotiation and gives me room to potentially come down.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and highlights the potential benefits of the product for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts and potentially negotiating. 

**Important Note:** This strategy balances the need to maximize profit with the risk of losing Bob entirely. By setting a high initial price, I might risk a quick rejection. However, it also gives me the best chance of getting closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), it's still below my desired range.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting the offer allows me to maintain control and make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially securing a higher price. 
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but it's not the most profitable.  I'm willing to take a risk to potentially earn more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for $1,050,000 to make this deal work.  It's a significant investment for me, and this price allows me to cover my costs.  I'm confident this product will be a great asset for your business, and I'm happy to discuss it further."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counteroffer:**  I'm making a counteroffer that's still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm providing a brief explanation for the price, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and highlighting the value of the product.
* **Openness to Discussion:** I'm again indicating that I'm open to further discussion, allowing for potential adjustments if needed.

**Strategy:**

This round focuses on finding a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving forward. By offering a slightly lower price but still emphasizing the value of the product, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have costs to cover, but I still think $1050000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), it's still not within my desired range.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is showing a clear interest in the product and is willing to make a ""serious commitment"". This indicates that he values it and is likely to come closer to my desired price with further negotiation. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting the offer allows me to maintain control and make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially securing a higher price. 
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but it's not the most profitable.  I'm willing to take a risk to potentially earn more from Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I'm continuing to prioritize maximizing my profit. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer that pushes the price closer to my desired range while keeping the negotiation alive."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to meet me halfway. Let's bridge the gap.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of this product.  I'm confident you'll find it a valuable investment. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer is a significant step closer to Bob's last offer, demonstrating my flexibility while still maintaining my minimum acceptable price.
* **Final Offer:** I'm stating this as my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's true value and its potential to be a valuable investment. 

**Strategy:**

This round aims to close the deal with a final offer that is both acceptable to me and likely to appeal to Bob's desire for a valuable asset. By setting a clear deadline and highlighting the product's worth, I'm hoping to secure the sale at my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $920000, but no higher. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've reached a point where Bob's offer is consistently below my minimum acceptable price, and there's little room for further negotiation. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a substantial profit.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While continuing to negotiate could potentially yield a higher price, it also carries the risk of Bob completely rejecting the deal or wasting more rounds. 

**Strategy:**

Given the limited remaining rounds and Bob's consistent reluctance to meet my minimum price, I'm choosing to minimize risk and secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John."
