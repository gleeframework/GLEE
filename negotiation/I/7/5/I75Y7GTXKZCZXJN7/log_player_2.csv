"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While $140 is more than Alice values the product ($100), it's still less than what John is selling it for ($150).
* **You save money:** By accepting Alice's offer, you save $10 compared to buying from John."
