"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

At this point, it's more advantageous to accept Alice's offer.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice will not go lower, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy at a price better than John's.  $130 is still within your budget and a good deal compared to John's price."
