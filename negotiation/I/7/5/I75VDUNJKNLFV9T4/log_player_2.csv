"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling a product you might be interested in. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'd like to reject the offer. The product is worth $120 to me, so paying $150 is not a good deal. I'll look for a better price elsewhere.
