"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's worth $150 to you, right? I'm willing to let it go for $140.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, it's still above your target of $150.  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate a potentially better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $130? "", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $135?  I'm flexible on this, but I'm not sure I can go lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $135 is within my budget and represents a good compromise.  Accepting this offer allows me to get the product for a good price and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
