"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm very interested in this product, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'd hoped. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for it.  This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit while still keeping within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1050000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1080000. This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1080000.0,Alice,3,
