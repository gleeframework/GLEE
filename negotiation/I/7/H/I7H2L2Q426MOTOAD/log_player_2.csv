"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a special price of $1,400,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than her product's value to her, it's still more expensive than buying from John. You can save $200,000 by going with John's offer."
