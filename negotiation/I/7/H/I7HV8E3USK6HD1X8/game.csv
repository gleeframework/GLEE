"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm placing on this product. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,350,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, while also being a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This offer is a significant step towards meeting your needs while still fitting within my budget. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, and I'm glad to see you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering $1,250,000. This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to you, while still allowing me to make a profit.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see we're both getting closer to an agreement.  I'm willing to offer $1,225,000 for the product. This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects both our needs.  I'm hopeful we can finalize this deal in the next round.",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to invest in this product. I'm glad to see we're getting close to a deal.

I'm counteroffering $1,275,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to you, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
