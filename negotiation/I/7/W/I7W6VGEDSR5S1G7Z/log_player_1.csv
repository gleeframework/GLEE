"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you! I'm asking for $18,000 for it. This is a premium item, and you won't find it anywhere else.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, given the value and uniqueness of this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13500 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is closer to my desired price point than the $12,000 John is offering.  Since we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, it's a good deal to accept."
