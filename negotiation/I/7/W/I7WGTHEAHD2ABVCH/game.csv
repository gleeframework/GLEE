"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $7,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a budget-friendly option, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $8,500? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but it's still a good compromise.",8500.0,Alice,5,
