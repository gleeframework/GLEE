"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's make this happen.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,050,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room. Let's try to make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
