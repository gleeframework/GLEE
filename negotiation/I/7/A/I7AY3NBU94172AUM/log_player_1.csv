Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business.  My initial price for it is $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm offering a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing me to maximize my profit.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging message sets a good tone for the negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Highlighting the potential benefits to Bob helps him see the value in the product and encourages him to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired value. 
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, it's important to remember that I want to maximize my profit. There's a chance I can achieve a better outcome by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is below what I need to accept, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still allows for a fair profit for me while giving you a good deal on this valuable product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Moderate Reduction:** I'm not dropping the price too drastically.  The $1,100,000 offer still allows for a substantial profit, and it signals to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Reiterate Value and Flexibility:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value while also demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate.  This helps to maintain a positive tone. 
* **Seek Common Ground:**  Framing the offer as a potential ""common ground"" helps to encourage Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think that's a fair price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Line:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a protracted process with no guarantee of a better outcome. There's also a chance that Bob will walk away, leaving me with no deal.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This provides certainty and a higher profit than I'm likely to achieve with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  While I'd prefer to maximize my profit, the risk of a lower price or no deal with Bob outweighs the potential reward. Selling to John is the most logical and risk-averse option."
