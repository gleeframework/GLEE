Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my target. Would you be willing to consider $128? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's tempting to push for more, but Bob is unlikely to go above $130. Taking the $128 is better than risking John changing his mind or getting stuck with a worse offer later on."
