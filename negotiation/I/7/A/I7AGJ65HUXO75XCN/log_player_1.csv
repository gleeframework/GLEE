Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

Explanation: While I could try to push for a bit more, accepting $110 is a good deal at this point. It's significantly more than my minimum ($100) and Bob is clearly interested.  Continuing to negotiate might frustrate Bob and risk losing the sale altogether."
