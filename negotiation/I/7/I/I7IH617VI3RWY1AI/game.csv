"Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1500000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price given its value. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which I believe is still a fair price considering its potential value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1000000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1300000. This price reflects the product's true value, while also giving you a good deal. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1150000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we've discussed, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's close this deal at $1250000. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still slightly higher than my ideal price point. I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the value we've both agreed upon, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement and move forward.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
