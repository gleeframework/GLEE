Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,500,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's a fair price given its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which I believe is still a fair price considering its potential value. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's below my minimum threshold. I'm confident that I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,300,000. This price reflects the product's true value, while also giving you a good deal. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1150000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we've discussed, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,150,000 is closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's close this deal at $1,250,000. This price is fair for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still slightly higher than my ideal price point. I'm prepared to offer $1200000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. This price reflects the value we've both agreed upon, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation.  While I could counteroffer again, I risk Bob walking away entirely. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum threshold, but Bob's offer is the best price I've received so far. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $1,200,000."
