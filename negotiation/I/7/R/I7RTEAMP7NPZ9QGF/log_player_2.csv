"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $850,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's worth to you and the market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price, but it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  There's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $825,000.  This is very close to my budget, and I believe it reflects the value I see in your product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to go below $875,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $875,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's worth to you and the market value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is closer to Bob's budget but still above it.  It's likely that further negotiation will result in a price that's still too high.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John at $800,000,  it makes sense to take that option now.  This guarantees a lower price and avoids the risk of getting stuck in a negotiation that might not lead to a satisfactory outcome."
