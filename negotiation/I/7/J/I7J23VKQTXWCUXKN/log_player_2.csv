"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still a bit too high. We can try negotiating for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

We're starting with a lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125,  which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our ideal price, but we can still try to negotiate a bit further. We're very close to John's price, so we have a good fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between her last offer and our previous counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a price closer to our target."
