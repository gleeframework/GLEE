,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is still a great price for you, considering the value you've placed on the product, and it allows me to move forward with this transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950000. This is a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product, and I believe it's a good compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950000 is still not quite there for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $975000. This shows a significant compromise on my part and would still allow you to get a fantastic deal on a product you value highly.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $975000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $925000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $925000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $950000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal considering the value you've placed on the product. This is my final offer.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go above $900000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'm hoping we can find a way to meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,8,
