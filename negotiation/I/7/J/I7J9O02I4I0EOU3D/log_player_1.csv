Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This allows room for negotiation and hopefully maximizes my potential profit. I'm also framing the message in a positive and engaging way to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $70 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $80 and allows for some potential negotiation.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of the offer to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob has shown interest and a willingness to negotiate, the price he's offering is still below my minimum.  Selling to John for $80 guarantees I meet my minimum price, and it avoids further negotiation with Bob."
