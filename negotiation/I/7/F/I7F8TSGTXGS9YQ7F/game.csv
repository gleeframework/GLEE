"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. This is a rare and valuable item, and I believe it would be a great asset to your operations. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find the value to be worth it.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay the full price. However, I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Let me know your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
