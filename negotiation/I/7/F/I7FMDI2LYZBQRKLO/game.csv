"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for this product. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties looking at this product, and I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,025,000 and $975,000, so I'll offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
