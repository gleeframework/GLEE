{""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $17,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value and gives Bob some room to negotiate. I'm confident I can get at least $15,000 from John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal."
