Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value and potential.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000) allowing for potential counteroffers from Bob. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and open to discussion, fostering a cooperative negotiation. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just the initial offer.  I will adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and any counteroffers. 
* I'll need to balance getting a good price with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and me having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you valuing the product at $1000000. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $800000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 matches my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No reason to risk further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee I can get a better price from Bob, and I risk losing him as a buyer.  
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Even though John is offering the same price, having the option to sell to him gives me peace of mind and prevents me from being stuck in a prolonged negotiation.

**By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at my minimum acceptable price with no further risk.**"
