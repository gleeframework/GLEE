{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm asking $125 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $125 is higher than your minimum of $100, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $150, so there's room for negotiation and a potential win-win scenario.
* **It's a fair opening offer:**  It's not too aggressive, allowing for a friendly and potentially successful negotiation.

Remember, this is just the first offer. You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and the negotiation that unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $100.  It's better to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

Here's why this counteroffer is good:

* **It's still above your minimum:** You're sticking to your principle of not selling below $100.
* **It's a compromise:** You're showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **It's a strong position:** $105 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $150.

This counteroffer shows you're serious about selling the product to Bob, but also that you value its worth. It gives Bob a good reason to consider your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $92.50 is still below my minimum value of $100. While it's tempting to keep negotiating, I've reached a point where it's more profitable to sell to John for $100. This ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price."
