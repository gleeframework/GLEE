"Bob, I understand that you're getting closer to the product's value, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $875000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'll sell it to you for $950000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1500000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,5,
