"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree that the product has potential, but the price point is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to move this negotiation forward. I believe this is a fair and competitive offer considering the value this product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price.  To be transparent, I have a standing offer for $1,200000 from another buyer.  However, I value our discussions and believe you would benefit greatly from this product. To close this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,150000. This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
