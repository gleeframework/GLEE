,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it. This would be a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential benefits for my business.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to engage in this discussion. Considering the value of the product and your expressed interest, I am willing to negotiate further.

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget constraints.  I believe this price is reasonable for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to move forward with this deal.",875000.0,Bob,6,
