"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can potentially get a better deal than $9,500. It's worth negotiating with Alice and seeing if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. That's a fair price for both of us, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than what you're aiming for. There's room for further negotiation, and you have more rounds to work with. It's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250.  I'm willing to go up to $9,100, which is a fair compromise. Let's make this happen before we both miss out on a great deal."", ""product_price"": 9100}
