"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I'm open to negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial price, but I think this is a great starting point.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, but also takes into account your concerns about the price.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to make a deal.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is well within Bob's budget. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiations breaking down and having to pay John's higher price."
