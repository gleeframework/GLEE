"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I'm open to negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial price, but I think this is a great starting point.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a little high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth, but also takes into account your concerns about the price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway Alice, but that's still a little too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to make a deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
