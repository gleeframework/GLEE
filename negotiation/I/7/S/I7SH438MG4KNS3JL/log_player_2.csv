You can do better than $90.  You should counteroffer and see if Alice will come down."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $87.50, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5

``` 
Alice is only willing to go down to $87.50, which is still a better deal than buying from John for $100. It's a good compromise and saves you some money."
