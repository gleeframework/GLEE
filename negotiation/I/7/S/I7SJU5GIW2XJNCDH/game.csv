"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product to me for $1,000,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about $1,100,000? This allows me to make some profit while still offering you a good deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, but  $1,100,000 is my final offer.  It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. ",1100000.0,Alice,5,
