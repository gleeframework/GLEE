"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to explore the possibility of buying the product, but I'd need to see a lower price. I'm willing to pay $700,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. ",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $800,000. However, I'm still open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price. If not, I'll consider other options.",800000.0,Alice,3,
