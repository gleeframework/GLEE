"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $150. I believe it will be of great value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer of $150 is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with the cheaper option."
