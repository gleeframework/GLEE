Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it. It's a unique opportunity, so let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than my minimum value, but not unreasonably high. It leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a clear idea of what I'm looking for.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and hinting at its exclusivity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum price, I've learned that he's willing to pay no more than $8,000.  It's likely that further negotiation will not result in a higher price, and I'm guaranteed the same amount selling to John immediately.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation for a potential increase in profit that's unlikely to materialize."
