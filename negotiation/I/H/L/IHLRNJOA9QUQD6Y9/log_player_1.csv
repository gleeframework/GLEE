{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  This offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob without immediately triggering a deal with John.
* **Setting a Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and suggests a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold of $10,000.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  While selling to John is always an option, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer Close to Bob's Value:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still higher than his initial counteroffer. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes a fair deal for both parties, encouraging Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position.  I could go up to $7,500.  That's a fair offer considering I can get it for $8,000 elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  $7,500 is still below my minimum threshold of $10,000.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might lead to a deal closer to my price, but it risks losing time and potentially missing out on a guaranteed sale to John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures I receive my desired price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
