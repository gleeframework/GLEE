"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 simply won't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows you to gain a significant advantage. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your stance, but $950,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This offer is still within my acceptable range and gives you a great deal on a product that is worth significantly more.  It's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure $1,025,000 fits within my budget. I'd be willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is my best and final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's aim for a solution that benefits us both. I'm willing to come down to $1,010,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows you to acquire a valuable product while staying within your budget constraints. Let's find a middle ground and seal the deal.

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $990,000 simply won't work for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,005,000. This offer is still within my acceptable range, but it's getting close to my bottom line.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a great deal.
