"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This price reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $11,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  It's closer to my ideal price and allows you to get more than what John is offering.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product.

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,750 is still a bit outside my budget. To make this work, I'm going to have to stick to my previous offer of $11,000.  This gives you a decent profit and is closer to my price point.  Let's try to close this deal before we run out of time.",11000.0,Bob,6,
