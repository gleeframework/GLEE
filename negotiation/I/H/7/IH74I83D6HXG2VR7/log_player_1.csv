Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can get him to come up closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm going to counteroffer with $13,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject it again.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,500. This is a final compromise, as it's only $500 above my absolute minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept, as I'm not likely to go any lower."
