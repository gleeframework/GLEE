{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows for potential counteroffers while ensuring I'm still making a decent profit. I can then adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and potentially use John as a backup buyer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. Would you be willing to consider $1200000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd like to sell the product, it's worth more than $1,200,000 to me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept a price that doesn't reflect the product's value. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."

I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price. How about $1,350,000? It's a compromise that still allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'd like to get.  I'll make one more counteroffer, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'll sell to John."
