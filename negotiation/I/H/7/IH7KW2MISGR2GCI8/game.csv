"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $75?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $75 is just too low for me. How about $85? This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $85 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'll offer $80.  This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",80.0,Bob,4,
