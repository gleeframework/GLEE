``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. It's closer to my maximum than her minimum, but there's room for negotiation. I'm going to try and get a better price before considering John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In light of that, I am willing to consider a middle ground. How about we agree on a price of $900,000 for the product? This still reflects its true value while accommodating your budget.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still not happy with the price. I'm going to counteroffer again and try to get closer to my target. I can still get a better deal than John's, so I'm not ready to give up on Alice yet."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your offer of $875,000. While it's closer to my original asking price, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. I propose a final offer of $890,000 for the product. This acknowledges the value you see in it while keeping a reasonable margin for us. I hope this proposal is acceptable.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly, and her final offer of $890,000 is very close to my ideal price. It's still a bit more than I'd like to pay, but it's a fair deal considering the value of the product. It's also much better than buying from John for $1,000,000."
