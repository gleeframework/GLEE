"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we compromise at $14,000? It's a great price for a fantastic product, if I do say so myself.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13,000? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really love it.",13000.0,Alice,5,
