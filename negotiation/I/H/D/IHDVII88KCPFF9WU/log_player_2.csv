# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

You can likely get a better price than $1,150,000, so it's worth negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is already a competitive price considering the value this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

While $1,100,000 is better than the initial offer, you can still try to push for a lower price. There's room for negotiation, and you can likely get closer to your target price."
