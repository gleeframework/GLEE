"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  How about $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $8,500 is still too low for me, and I think I can get closer to my target price of $10,000 with some more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $8,800?  That would be a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8,800 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $8,600.  Let's split the difference and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $8,600 is a good compromise, and it's closer to my target price than his last offer.  I'm confident we can close the deal."
