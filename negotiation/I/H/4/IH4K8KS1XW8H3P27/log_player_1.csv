"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,800,000. This is a fair price considering its unique value. I believe it's a great opportunity for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,800,000, significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Highlighting value:** My message emphasizes the product's unique value to make it seem more appealing to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm framing the offer as a starting point, implying I'm open to negotiation. 
* **Safeguard:** If Bob rejects, I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less than $1800000. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I have 9 more rounds and can potentially get a better deal. By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my ideal value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is still below what this product is truly worth.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which reflects its unique value and the potential it offers you. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by counter-offering at $1,600,000. This is a reasonable compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Framing for closure:** I'm emphasizing the potential for a ""good deal"" for both parties to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1600000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1520000 for it. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,520,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,520,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,520,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers as the opportunity to sell to John is still on the table.  Accepting this offer guarantees a profit for me and minimizes the risk of losing a sale."
