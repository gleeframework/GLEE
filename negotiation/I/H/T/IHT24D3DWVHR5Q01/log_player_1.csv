Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept $1,500,000 from John, so you have a buffer to work with.
* **It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate:**  By offering a price, you show Bob you're open to finding a solution.

Keep in mind, this is just the first step. Be prepared to negotiate further based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets within your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept $1,100,000, you can potentially get much closer to your target price with John.  

It's better to counter Bob's offer and see if you can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our negotiation, $1,100,000 is still below my acceptable range. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but unfortunately, I cannot go above $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it provides. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge much further. While you could counteroffer again, the risk of going through more rounds and potentially lowering your price even further is high.  

John is offering you your minimum, and selling to him guarantees you the best possible outcome."
