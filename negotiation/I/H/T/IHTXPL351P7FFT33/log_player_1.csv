Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with even less."
