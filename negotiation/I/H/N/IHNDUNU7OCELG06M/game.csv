"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $1,100,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still reflects the value this product brings.  Let's bridge the gap and make this happen.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product and my budget constraints.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see your point about the price, but $1,250,000 is still too far below the product's true value. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000, which reflects a substantial compromise on my part. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm appreciative of your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the value I place on your product.  Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",1275000.0,Bob,8,
