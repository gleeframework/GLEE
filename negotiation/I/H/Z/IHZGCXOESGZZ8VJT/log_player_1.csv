Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to move this forward.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now offering $1,050,000. This is more than your guaranteed sale to John ($1,000,000). While you'd ideally like to get more, continuing to negotiate risks Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Taking the sure profit now is the best decision."
