"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's full value, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to move this forward.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
