"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This allows for some negotiation space while ensuring I get as close to my desired price as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is better than Bob's initial value, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500.  This is a fair price given the value of the product to both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're able to continue negotiating, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my target, I'm still not at a point where I'm comfortable accepting it. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm confident that my product is worth more than $13,200.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,400.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13300 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm now only $100 away from my last offer, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale, and selling to John would only net me a higher price of $100.  I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future, and it's better to secure a sale now."
