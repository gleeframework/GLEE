"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. The product looks great, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $145. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product!",145.0,Alice,5,
