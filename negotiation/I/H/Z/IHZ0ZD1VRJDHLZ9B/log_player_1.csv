"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its true worth. Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a high price to establish a strong starting point and leave room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:**  Highlighting the ""true worth"" of the product subtly emphasizes its value to Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counter, acknowledging that negotiation is expected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget, I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** I believe there is still room for negotiation with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **John is a backup:**  While John offers a safe $800,000, I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  This product is worth considerably more than that.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** My counteroffer of $900,000 is significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price. 
* **Reiterate value:** I emphasize the product's value to reinforce my stance and justify the price.
* **Focus on finding common ground:** I use language like ""middle ground"" and ""fair compromise"" to emphasize the need for collaboration and a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $900000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation continues:**  Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, suggesting there's room for further negotiation.  I'm not ready to settle yet.
* **John is a solid backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 gives me the flexibility to continue negotiations with Bob without immediate pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to go down to $850,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll receive.  Let's finalize this now."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but not too much:**  I've lowered my price to $850,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This demonstrates flexibility while maintaining my target. 
* **Highlight value:**  I emphasize the ""true value"" again to remind Bob of the product's worth and justify my stance.
* **Finality:**  The message conveys urgency by saying ""Let's finalize this now,"" creating a sense of urgency to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that $800000 is a fair price for both of us. It's my final offer, and I hope you'll accept it.  This will allow us to both walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 finally reaches my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Final offer:**  He has stated it's his final offer, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal entirely.
* **John's offer is the same:** John's offer is also $800,000, so there's no advantage in choosing him over Bob.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure the deal and avoid further rounds of negotiation."
