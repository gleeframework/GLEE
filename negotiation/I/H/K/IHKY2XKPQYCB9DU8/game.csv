,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is around $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to $13,000? ",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $13,000 is a significant drop from my asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
