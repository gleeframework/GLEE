Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high ($1,100,000) allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing a price higher than John's offer.
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** Offering it too close to $1,200,000 risks immediate rejection. Offering it too low leaves potential profit on the table. $1,100,000 aims for a sweet spot."
