"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further and exploring possibilities that benefit us both.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that's more realistic. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to make this a win-win. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and its potential for you.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a big gap for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  I think that's a fair offer considering I could buy it elsewhere for $800,000.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This offer takes into account the product's unique value while acknowledging your budget considerations.  Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need you to come down further for this to make sense for me.  How about $850,000?  That's a significant increase on my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest.",850000.0,Bob,6,
