"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm countering with $95. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm still holding out for a higher price, but I'm showing flexibility to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $90. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, we're already four rounds in, and it's getting close to the point where selling to John might be the better option.  $90 is a decent profit, and it seems like Bob might be more interested in getting the product than negotiating further."
