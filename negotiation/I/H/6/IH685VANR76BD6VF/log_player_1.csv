Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. While it's unlikely he'll accept immediately, it gives us room to negotiate.
* **John as Leverage (Implicitly):**  We don't explicitly mention John, but suggesting the product is in high demand and we're offering Bob an exclusive opportunity subtly implies we have other options.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still staying above our minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening move. How we proceed depends on Bob's response. We might need to adjust our strategy based on his counter-offers or willingness to negotiate."
