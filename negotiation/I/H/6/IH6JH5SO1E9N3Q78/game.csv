"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit high for me right now. How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value I see in it.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $800,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I see in it. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
