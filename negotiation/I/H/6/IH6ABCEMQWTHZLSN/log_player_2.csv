"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is way too high. It's best to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a good value for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is considerably below the value of what this product brings.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a competitive advantage.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's better than her initial price, I can likely get it lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it's a significant step closer to where we both need to be."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
