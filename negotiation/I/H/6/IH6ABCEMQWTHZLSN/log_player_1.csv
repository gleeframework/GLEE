"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  We want to anchor the negotiation high, significantly above both your minimum price and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a premium.
* **Justifying the Price:**  While we don't want to reveal all our cards, hinting at the product's ""unique features"" and ""potential"" provides some justification for the high initial price.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The tone is positive and collaborative (""mutually beneficial agreement""), encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than walk away immediately.

This strategy balances ambition with the understanding that this is just the opening move. We expect a counteroffer, which will give us more information about Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a good value for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While he's moved up slightly from his perceived value, there's plenty of room for negotiation.  It's too early to accept his offer or sell to John at this point. We'll use the next round to counter and see if we can draw him closer to a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is considerably below the value of what this product brings.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a competitive advantage.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession from our initial price to show Bob we're serious about negotiating. However, we're not meeting him halfway just yet.
* **Reiterating Value:** We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's benefits (""competitive advantage"") to justify the still-high price. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** Ending with ""What do you say?"" invites Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation flowing.

This counteroffer aims to find a balance: demonstrate willingness to negotiate while holding firm on a price significantly above Bob's current offer and closer to your minimum acceptable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it's a significant step closer to where we both need to be. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could try to push for a bit more in the next round, there's a risk that Bob might reduce his offer or walk away altogether.  Accepting this offer guarantees you a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
