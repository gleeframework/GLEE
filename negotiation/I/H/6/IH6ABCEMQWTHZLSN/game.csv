"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product, which is still a good value for both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is considerably below the value of what this product brings.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This reflects the true worth of the product while still offering you a competitive advantage.  What do you say?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $1,900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it's a significant step closer to where we both need to be.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
