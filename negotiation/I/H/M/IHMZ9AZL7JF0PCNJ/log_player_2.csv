"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

The goal is to save as much money as possible. Since the product is worth $100 or less to me, accepting Alice's offer of $120 is not a good deal.  It makes sense to reject the offer and see if I can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $90?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price.  By offering $90, I'm leaving room for negotiation and testing her willingness to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I can do $105, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above my maximum value of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and see if I can get her to come down further.  While John offers a guaranteed price of $100, it's worth seeing if I can do better with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a little high for me.  Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm continuing to negotiate by offering a price closer to my maximum value of $100, but leaving some room for Alice to compromise.  By emphasizing my interest in the product, I'm hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage her to accept my counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob. I can meet you halfway at $100, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 matches my maximum value for the product. While I could potentially keep negotiating, there's a risk that she might reject further counteroffers and I would be forced to buy from John for the same price.  It's more efficient to accept her offer and finalize the deal."
