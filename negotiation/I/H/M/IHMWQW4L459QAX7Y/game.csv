"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. Can we meet in the middle at $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $1250000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping to receive. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price considering the unique value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is unique, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet in the middle at $1225000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about the budget, but $1225000 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1275000. This is a small step closer to your offer, and it's a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1275000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1275000, which would be $1187500. Can we consider that price?",1187500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your perspective and your budget constraints. However, $1187500 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to offer a final counteroffer of $1220000. This is a fair price considering the unique value of this product, and it's also a compromise from my previous offers.  Let's finalize this deal, or we'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
