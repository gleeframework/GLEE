"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is far too low for me. I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to go down to $9,000. That's a significant price reduction from my initial offer and still allows you to get a good deal on a valuable product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $9,000 is closer, but still a bit of a stretch. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $7,000 is tempting, it's still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This gives you a good deal, and it allows me to move this product without having to go with another buyer.  Let's close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
