"Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still offers you a good deal. It's a compromise that allows us both to benefit. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - $1,012,500. It's a fair price that's closer to your offer but still reflects the value of the product. This is my final offer, so let me know your decision.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
