Alice's offer:

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $187,500 less than John's price.
* **Alice's Firm Stance:**  Her language (""final offer"") suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further negotiation might only yield small savings and risk the deal altogether."
