"Hi Alice, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still a decent profit for you and within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
