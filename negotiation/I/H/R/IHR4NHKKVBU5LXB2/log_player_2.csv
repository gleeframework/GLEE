"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $15,000. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  There's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it's still a decent profit for you and within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $13,000 is closer to his budget than $15,000, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He can still get the product from John for $10,000."
