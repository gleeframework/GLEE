"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for both of us - it's significantly less than what I could get from another buyer, and it's a fantastic price for you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Even though Alice's offer is lower than her product's worth, it's still more expensive than John's offer. Bob can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
