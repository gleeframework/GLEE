"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to propose a price of $675,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be comfortable with.",675000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the value this product holds. However,  $675,000 is significantly below its true worth and potential for profit. Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $1,100,000 is still above my target budget. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'd like to propose a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the potential profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",900000.0,Bob,4,
