"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it truly valuable, and I'm confident you'll be willing to make a serious investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, Bob can potentially save more by negotiating with Alice.  There is still room for a counteroffer that could result in a lower price, potentially closer to Alice's desired price of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to invest a bit less. Would you consider $950,000 for the product? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  This strategy aims to:

* **Show Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating:** A significant counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Open the door for further negotiation:** Alice is likely to counter with a price closer to Bob's offer, leading to a potential compromise. 
* **Minimize risk:** While Bob could offer a lower price, this counteroffer keeps the negotiation within a range where Alice is more likely to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $950000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product for $1050000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and meets your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise, and a significant improvement from her initial offer of $1,100,000. Accepting this offer saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John. While Bob might be able to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower counteroffer and ultimately forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings."
