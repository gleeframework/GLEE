Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so $120 is a significant increase but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to accept no less than $150, but this initial offer leaves you room to negotiate upwards if Bob is interested.

By starting with this offer, you:

* **Show you're open to negotiation:** This sets a positive tone for the interaction.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:** If Bob counteroffers, you have space to work with. 
* **Set the stage to potentially get closer to your desired price:** If Bob is interested, you might be able to nudge the price higher through subsequent negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and attempt to counteroffer.  It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a little lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $110.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $95 is a more reasonable price for me. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved up to $95, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I've already been through a couple of rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely that Bob will come much higher. At this point, I'm better off selling to John for the guaranteed $150. This ensures I reach my minimum goal and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
