"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a premium price of $12,000. I believe in its value and think it could be highly beneficial for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It's highly unlikely she's genuinely willing to sell it for anything near your range with that opener. You should counter-offer with a much lower price to gauge her real flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider buying it for $5,000."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This establishes a low anchor point for the negotiation. While $5,000 is significantly below Alice's asking price, it leaves room for you to negotiate upwards towards your $8,000 limit.
* **Gauge Reaction:** This counter-offer will help you understand Alice's flexibility. If she's willing to come down significantly, there's potential for a deal. If she's completely unwilling to budge from the $12,000 range, you can always walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $5,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, which is a good sign. However, $9,000 is still above your maximum price. You're very close to John's offer, so it's worth trying to negotiate a bit further before resorting to buying from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $7,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:**  This counter-offer aims for a price comfortably below your $8,000 limit while still being a significant increase from your initial $5,000 offer. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning your budget and acknowledging the product's value, you're demonstrating seriousness while also subtly pressuring Alice to move closer to your range.
* **Leaving Room:** This offer leaves some room for a final compromise (e.g., meeting in the middle at $7,500), should Alice be unwilling to go as low as $7,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I need to get a reasonable price for this product.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your maximum price. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, since you've achieved the best possible outcome."
