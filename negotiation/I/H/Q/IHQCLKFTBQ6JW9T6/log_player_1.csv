Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $925,000. I'm confident this price reflects the significant benefit it offers."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).

Offering the product at $925,000 creates a win-win scenario:

* **Bob's Gain:** Bob gets the product for $75,000 less than its value to him.
* **Your Gain:** You make a $125,000 profit above your minimum sale price.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
