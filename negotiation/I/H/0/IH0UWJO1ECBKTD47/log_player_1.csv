"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it allows room for negotiation. I believe it's a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is a decent amount, it's still lower than my initial asking price and I believe I can get closer to my desired value. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still a good amount for me.  I believe it's a fair price that might entice Bob to accept, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's still slightly lower than my desired price, it's getting closer.  Further negotiation may not yield a significantly better outcome, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'll take the $13,500 and move on."
