"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10250? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to earn a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested!",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $10000? This is the highest I can go, but I'm really interested in the product. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Bob,4,
