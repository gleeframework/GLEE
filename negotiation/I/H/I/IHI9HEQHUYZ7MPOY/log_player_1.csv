"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I can lower the price in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's my minimum value and I want to see if I can get a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering the price slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a profit. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while hopefully still securing a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $125, which is above my minimum value of $120. It's a decent profit margin, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely by continuing to negotiate."
