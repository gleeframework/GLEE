{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love! I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is strategic:

* **It's not too aggressive:**  $13,000 is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's still a good deal for me:** I'm aiming to get a price closer to my $10,000 floor, but I'm willing to be flexible.
* **It signals my willingness to negotiate:** The message clearly implies I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. 

I'll keep an eye on Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I'll try to understand his reasoning and see if I can make a better counteroffer. I'll also remember I have a backup option with John if negotiations don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than my floor price, I'm not going to accept it just yet. Bob is clearly willing to pay more than $10,000, and I want to see if I can squeeze a little more out of him.  I'll try a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  While $11,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $12,000 for the product.  That way, we both get a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,000. How about we try $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was aiming for a higher price, $11,500 is still a good deal for me. It's above my floor price of $10,000, and I'm confident that further negotiations might not get me a significantly better price. 

It's important to be realistic and recognize that sometimes a good deal is better than a potentially better deal that might not happen.  I'm happy with this outcome."
