"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  While $11,000 is a good offer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $12,000 for the product.  That way, we both get a good outcome.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $12,000. How about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
