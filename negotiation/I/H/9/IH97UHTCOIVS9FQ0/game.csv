"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my own budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This is a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. ",887500.0,Alice,5,
