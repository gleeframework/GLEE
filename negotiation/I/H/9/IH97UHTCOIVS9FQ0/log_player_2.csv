"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering. You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I want to pay.  While she's showing some flexibility, there's still room to negotiate. I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and her offer is closer to my maximum, but it's still too high. I'll try to get her down further with another counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $875,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still a little below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $887,500. This is a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is just slightly above my last counteroffer of $875,000.  It's still within my budget and a good deal considering my willingness to pay up to $1,000,000.  It's likely that if I reject, Alice won't budge further and I'll end up buying from John at a higher price.  It's better to accept this offer and save some money."
