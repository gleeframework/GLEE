"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Would you like to make it yours for $25000?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $25000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8000.  Let me know if that's a starting point for us.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $18000, which is a significant discount from the original price. Is that something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8000.  If that doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I can meet you at $12000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still beyond my budget. I'm going to stick with my offer of $8000. If that doesn't work, I'll have to move on.",8000.0,Bob,6,
