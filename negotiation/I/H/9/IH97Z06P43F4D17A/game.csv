"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit above what I can comfortably spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still stuck at $10,750.  This is my final offer before I need to consider other options.  Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $10,750.  My final offer is $10,900. This is a very fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let me know your decision.",10900.0,Alice,5,
