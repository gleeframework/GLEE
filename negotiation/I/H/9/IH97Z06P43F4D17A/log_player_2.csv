"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, Bob has 10 rounds and can likely negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counteroffer process and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit above what I can comfortably spend right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This signals his seriousness in negotiating and sets the stage for a potential back-and-forth.  The $10,500 price is still above Alice's value of $10,000, leaving room for a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has 7 rounds left and can potentially get a lower price. Rejecting allows Bob to counter and continue exploring a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $11,000 is getting closer, but I'm still stuck at $10,750.  This is my final offer before I need to consider other options.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise while staying within his budget. The offer is still below Alice's value, creating potential for a deal. The message emphasizes this is Bob's final offer, potentially pressuring Alice to accept or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $10,750.  My final offer is $10,900. This is a very fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $10,900 is within Bob's budget and a good deal for him.  With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might raise her price again or Bob could end up buying from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids potential risks."
