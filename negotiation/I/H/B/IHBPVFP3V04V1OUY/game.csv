"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It's valued at $800000 to you, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable. My initial offer is $1000000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me at this moment. I am really interested in this product but my maximum budget is $800000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly below my minimum price, I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $900000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me and represents my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I still need a bit more to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really pushing my budget here, but I'm willing to go up to $875000.  This is a fair price considering our previous negotiations, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  However,  $875000 is still significantly below my minimum asking price.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering the product for $925000. This is a fair price given the value it holds for you.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know what you think.",925000.0,Alice,7,
