Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer above Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and the potential for others to be interested (""list it publicly""). 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 provides a safety net.  I don't need to go below that price. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Excellent! I get a price significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** We can bargain.  I have flexibility down to $15,000.
* **Bob Rejects:**  No problem. I proceed with selling to John at my desired minimum."
