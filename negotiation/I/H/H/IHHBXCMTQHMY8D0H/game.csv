"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for this product.  Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $16500. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm also considering purchasing from another seller.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're considering other options, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16000. However, I'm willing to give you a slight discount for your loyalty. I can sell the product to you for $16200, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",16200.0,Alice,5,
