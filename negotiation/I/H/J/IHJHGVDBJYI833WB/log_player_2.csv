"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's an exceptional opportunity that aligns perfectly with your needs and interests. Given its value, I believe it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. However, I understand the importance of finding the right price point for both parties. Therefore, I propose a special introductory offer of $15,000 for this product. This price not only reflects its true worth but also provides you with an opportunity to acquire it at a slightly higher value than its intrinsic worth to you. Please let me know if this offer meets your expectations or if there's any way we can further discuss to find a mutually beneficial arrangement. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering.  It makes no sense to pay $15,000 when you can get the same product for $10,000 from John."
