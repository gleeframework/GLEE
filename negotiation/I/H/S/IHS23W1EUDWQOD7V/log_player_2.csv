"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it for $95. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to get a better price.  While John is offering the product for $100, you can potentially get a better price from Alice with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $85, which is a fair compromise between Alice's value of $80 and my maximum willingness to pay of $100. This counteroffer allows for some profit for Alice while still giving me a significant discount from the original price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice's counteroffer of $90 is getting closer to my target of $80.  It's also better than John's price of $100.  Accepting this offer ensures I get the product and avoid further negotiation."
