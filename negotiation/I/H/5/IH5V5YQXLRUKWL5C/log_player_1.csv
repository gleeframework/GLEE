{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate if he counters.  I'm also being friendly and positive to create a good rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm a bit flexible, but I'd like to save as much as I can. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counter with a price closer to my target, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115? That's still a good deal for you, and it's fair for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $110 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120 and it's likely that further negotiation will only lead to a lower price."
