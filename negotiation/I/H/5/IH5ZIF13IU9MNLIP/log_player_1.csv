Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $115 for it."",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

Offering the product at $115 gives Bob a good deal while still allowing you to maximize your profit. This approach aims to secure the sale with Bob, avoiding the need to settle for John's lower offer."
