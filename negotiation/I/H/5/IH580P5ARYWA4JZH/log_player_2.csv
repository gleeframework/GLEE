{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a significant discount.  This is a risky strategy, but it demonstrates Bob's commitment to getting a good price and might encourage Alice to negotiate."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  There are still rounds left, and Bob can continue trying to negotiate a lower price.  If he rejects the offer, he might get closer to his ideal price or at least get a better sense of Alice's bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

This could lead to a quicker negotiation and potentially a successful outcome."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  With several rounds remaining, Bob can continue to negotiate and attempt to get a lower price.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to compromise further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is incrementally raising his offer again.  $10,750 is still within his budget and shows he's willing to negotiate, but also indicates a clear price range that he's comfortable with.  By demonstrating flexibility and offering a price close to his maximum, Bob is showing a commitment to closing the deal while still trying to secure a good price."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is back at $12,000, which is the same as her initial offer.  This indicates that she may not be willing to negotiate further.  With only three rounds remaining, the potential for a successful negotiation is decreasing.  Given this,  Bob is better off buying from John for $10,000.  He's guaranteed to get the product at his desired price, and he doesn't need to risk losing more time with Alice."
