"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still well below my minimum price and a great value for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price we're both comfortable with.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using language that emphasizes the value for both of us.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate, which encourages Bob to participate in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum price of $15,000 and even my initial offer of $12,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss. 
* **There are still rounds left:** I have 9 rounds left, which gives me ample time to negotiate a better price with Bob.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed option:** If I can't find a price that works with Bob, I can always sell to John for $15,000.

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round with a price closer to my minimum, but still acknowledging his budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still gives me a good margin and should be a great price for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price from $12,000 to $11,000, showing willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the value of the product to emphasize why this price is still fair.
* **Open to Discussion:** I end with a question to encourage further negotiation and keep the conversation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While $10,500 is closer to my minimum price of $15,000, it's still significantly lower. I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.
* **More negotiation time:**  I have 6 rounds left, giving me ample time to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **John is a guaranteed buyer:**  Selling to John is a backup option, ensuring I'll get my minimum price.

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, trying to push the price closer to my minimum while still acknowledging his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident this will be a great investment for you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price again, but this time only by $500. 
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value and potential return on investment for Bob.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, hoping to keep the negotiation productive.
* **Open to Compromise:**  I'm making it clear that I'm still open to further negotiation, but I'm also trying to set a firm bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While $10,800 is getting closer, it's still considerably less than my minimum price of $15,000 and my starting price of $12,000. 
* **Time is running out:** I only have 4 rounds left. It's important to push for a better price or consider selling to John.
* **John's offer is a safe option:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and provides a safe alternative to potentially accepting a low offer from Bob. 

I will make a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get closer to my desired price. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll likely need to sell to John to ensure I don't lose out on a good deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $10,800 is still a significant distance from my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and drop the price to $11,150. This is a final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other options. I'm confident this price will be a great value for you, considering the potential of this product."", ""product_price"": 11150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm lowering the price again but only by a small amount, making it clear that I'm pushing my limits. 
* **Final Offer:** I'm emphasizing that this is a final offer to increase the pressure on Bob to agree.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the potential of the product to encourage him to accept.
* **Alternative Options:**  I'm hinting at selling to John, which might motivate Bob to agree.

This is a crucial round. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll likely sell to John in the next round to ensure a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $11150 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $10900, but that's my absolute maximum. I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 8, leaving only two rounds left. 
* **Insufficient gains:**  $10,900 is still significantly below my minimum price of $15,000 and my starting price of $12,000. It's unlikely that Bob will budge much further in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $15,000, which is my minimum requirement.

While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, the risk of ending up with a lower price than I need is too high. It's better to secure the guaranteed profit from John."
