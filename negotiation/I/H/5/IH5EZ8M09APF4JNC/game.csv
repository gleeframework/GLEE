"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still well below my minimum price and a great value for you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $9000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11000. This still gives me a good margin and should be a great price for you considering the value of the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $10500. Can you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise. However, $10500 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $11500, which is a fair price for both of us.  I'm confident this will be a great investment for you. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $11500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",10800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $10800 is still a significant distance from my minimum price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and drop the price to $11150. This is a final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider other options. I'm confident this price will be a great value for you, considering the potential of this product.",11150.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $11150 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $10900, but that's my absolute maximum. I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement on this price.",10900.0,Bob,8,
