"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's a good deal for Alice, it's still above your maximum price point of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiating is worthwhile.** There's room for negotiation, and you have 10 rounds to try and get a better price.
* **John's offer is a fallback.** It's good to know that you have another option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:**  This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing you're serious about negotiation. However, it's still above Alice's minimum price point, making it a potentially acceptable compromise.
* **Justification:** You've provided a clear reason for your counteroffer, emphasizing the value of the product to both parties and your budget constraints.
* **Open to compromise:** You've ended the message with a positive tone, suggesting a willingness to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $850,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value you'll gain. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

* **More negotiation is possible.** There's still room to negotiate further, especially since Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** It's reassuring to know that you have an alternative if negotiations with Alice fall through.

**Next steps:**  You should send Alice a counteroffer that is lower than $900,000 but still within your budget and potentially appealing to Alice. You can also try to highlight the benefits of a deal that benefits both parties."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a middle ground. Let's try $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and keeps us within a reasonable range. Let's keep this momentum going and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $875,000 still doesn't meet my minimum requirements.  Let's try $890,000. This is a fair compromise, and it keeps us both within a reasonable range. Let's work towards a successful conclusion to this negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
