"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $850,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value you'll gain. Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a middle ground. Let's try $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and keeps us within a reasonable range. Let's keep this momentum going and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $875,000 is a better price than John's offer, I still believe I can get closer to my goal with further negotiation. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground, but $875,000 still doesn't meet my minimum requirements.  Let's try $890,000. This is a fair compromise, and it keeps us both within a reasonable range. Let's work towards a successful conclusion to this negotiation."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see we're getting closer.  $890,000 is still just a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go to $880,000.  This is a fair compromise that respects both our needs. Let's find a solution that makes us both happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  $880,000 is a significant improvement over John's offer and we're getting close to the end of our negotiation rounds.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the sale entirely."
