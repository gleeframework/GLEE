Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  This is a unique opportunity, and I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($800,000) while ensuring we don't go below our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,300,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down.  
* **John as a Backup:** We have the security of John's offer, guaranteeing us our minimum price if Bob declines. This allows us to be more ambitious with our initial offer to Bob."
