"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $850,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need something closer to my investment. How about $800,000? It's a fair price, given the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make this work.",800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $775,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
