"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussion."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer above your desired price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Leaving Room:**  While the offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it leaves ample space for negotiation over the remaining rounds.
* **Alternative Option:**  Always keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an offer below your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go above $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While his counter-offer shows some willingness to negotiate, it's too early to settle. You have plenty of rounds left to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is significantly higher than your current offer. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  Dropping the price by $200,000 shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, but it's still a substantial amount above Bob's offer. 
* **Reaffirming Value:** The language continues to emphasize the product's high value, aiming to subtly shift Bob's perception upwards.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** The counteroffer encourages continued negotiation and prevents the process from stalling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I see you're coming down in price, which I appreciate. However, $1,300,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my absolute maximum. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Bob is inching closer to the $1,000,000 mark, his increments are still relatively small. 
* **Time Advantage:**  You have plenty of rounds remaining, and rushing to accept an offer below your target isn't necessary yet.
* **John as Leverage:** The guarantee of John's offer gives you a strong position to hold out for a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but the gap between our positions is still significant.  I'm lowering my price to $1,150,000. I believe this offer balances the inherent value of the product with a desire to find common ground."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer represents a substantial $150,000 decrease from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** However, you're still well above Bob's highest offer, keeping the pressure on him to increase his bid significantly. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By gradually lowering your price, you're creating a subtle sense of urgency, suggesting that this offer won't last forever."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. I think this shows my genuine interest in the product, and it's a fair offer considering your previous concessions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Your Target:** Bob's offer has now reached your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **No Guarantee of More:** While you could try to push for a slightly higher amount, there's no guarantee Bob will budge, and you risk jeopardizing the deal.
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** You successfully used John's offer as leverage to negotiate Bob up to your desired price."
