"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum value ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit. 
* **Message:** I'm being polite and professional, emphasizing the product's value and inviting Bob to discuss the offer. 
* **Strategy:**  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play the negotiation game. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,250,000? I appreciate your understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer is closer to his value ($1,000,000) than my minimum value ($1,500,000).  Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **My strategy:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round.  I'm not willing to sell below my minimum value unless I have no other options. 
* **Selling to John:** While John is offering my minimum value, I still have 9 rounds to negotiate with Bob. I believe I can potentially get a higher price from Bob, or at least come close to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still below what I need to accept. I understand you're working within a budget, but my product's value warrants a price closer to $1,500,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($1,250,000) and my desired price ($1,500,000). 
* **Message:** I'm being firm but still polite, acknowledging Bob's budget while emphasizing the product's value. I'm also using ""meet in the middle"" language to make the offer seem more collaborative.
* **Strategy:** I believe this counteroffer is fair and gives Bob a good opportunity to come closer to my minimum value. If he rejects again, I'll have to re-evaluate my options, but for now, I'm confident that I can secure a better price than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've been considering your product carefully, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. I propose $1,350,000 as a compromise. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints. I hope you'll consider this proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:** Bob's offer is slightly higher than his initial offer, but it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **My strategy:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. I've only had four rounds so far, and I'm not willing to sell for a price that's so far below my desired value. 
* **Selling to John:** While John is offering my minimum value, I still believe I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I understand your budget constraints, $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This reflects the product's value and gives us both some room for agreement.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but not by much. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give in completely.  The $1,450,000 price is still above my minimum but indicates a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's budget and emphasize the product's value. I use positive language like ""move forward"" and ""room for agreement"" to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Strategy:**  I'm testing the waters to see if Bob is willing to budge further. If he rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John, but I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've thought about it, and I believe we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. I propose $1,425,000 as a compromise. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. I hope you'll consider this proposal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:**  Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value ($1,500,000) and is only $25,000 away. While it's tempting, I believe I can still get a better price.
* **My strategy:** I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. We've only had 6 rounds, and I'm still confident I can get a more favorable deal.
* **Selling to John:**  Even though John's offer is my minimum value, I want to exhaust all options with Bob before settling for that. I'm motivated by the possibility of getting closer to my desired price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,425,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to reach a price that's slightly closer to my desired value. How about we meet in the middle one last time at $1,437,500? This is a small increase, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth.  Let's try to find a final solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1437500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm raising the price slightly, aiming for a price midpoint between my previous offer ($1,450,000) and Bob's offer ($1,425,000). This small increase shows I'm still aiming for a better price but demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the product's worth and using positive language like ""final solution"" and ""both of us"" to keep the negotiation amicable. I'm hoping this final compromise will be enough for Bob to accept.
* **Strategy:**  I'm using a tactic of making a small increase, hoping it will be enough to push Bob toward acceptance. If he rejects, I will seriously consider selling to John.  However, I have 3 rounds left, so I'm not giving up on reaching a deal with Bob yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence in trying to find a mutually agreeable price. I've considered your latest offer, and I believe we can reach a fair compromise. I propose $1,430,000 as a final offer. This is the highest I can go while still adhering to my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,430,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,430,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer:**  This offer is only $7,500 away from my minimum value of $1,500,000. Considering it's my eighth round, and I only have two rounds left, accepting this offer is a good strategy.
* **My strategy:** I've been able to negotiate Bob's price up significantly from his initial offer of $1,000,000. With two rounds left, it's unlikely I'll be able to get a much better offer. 
* **Selling to John:** While John is offering my minimum value, I'm comfortable accepting Bob's offer as it's a good price and allows me to avoid the risk of not reaching a deal."
