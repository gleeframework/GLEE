,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still interested in the product. Can we meet at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can agree on this.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to stay within my budget. Can we try $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $825,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $850,000.  This is the lowest I can go, but it still allows for a fair return on my investment.  If you're truly interested, I encourage you to reconsider.",850000.0,Alice,7,
