"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds. Let me know what you think!",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,475,000? This is a fair price for both of us and ensures a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1475000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1,475,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in between?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is still too far off from my desired price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $1,400,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,300,000 and $1,400,000, which would be $1,350,000. Can we make a deal at this price?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I'm determined to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to lower my price one last time to $1,375,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's make this deal happen.",1375000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,375,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000 for the product. Let's see if we can meet at this price.",1325000.0,Bob,8,
