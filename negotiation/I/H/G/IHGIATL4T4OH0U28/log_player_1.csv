``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  It also frames the product as desirable to pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

``` 
 
Bob's offer is only $10 less than my initial offer and above my minimum price. Accepting this offer is the best option as I can still earn a decent profit."
