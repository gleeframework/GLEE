"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

It's better to reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for $100 from John, so anything higher than that is a bad deal for you. By rejecting, you open the door to potentially getting a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This offer is a good starting point.  It's below Alice's asking price but still likely above her desired selling price. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still giving you a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $87 is a good deal for you. It's below your maximum price of $100 and closer to your desired price. You're likely not going to get a better offer from Alice, so accepting now makes sense."
