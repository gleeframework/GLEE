"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000, considering its unique features and benefits. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product from John for $10,000.  There's no reason to accept this initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I see the value in this product, $20,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. This offers a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price of $17,000 is a fair reflection of that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than his $10,000 ceiling. It's worth continuing to negotiate, especially since he has 7 rounds remaining.  There's a good chance Alice will come down in price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is still too high for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $14,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering it's worth $15,000 to you, and it's within my budget. "", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
