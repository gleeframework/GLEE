"Alice, while I see the value in this product, $20,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. This offers a fair deal for both of us. ",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe a price of $17,000 is a fair reflection of that.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is still too high for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $14,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering it's worth $15,000 to you, and it's within my budget. ",14000.0,Bob,4,
