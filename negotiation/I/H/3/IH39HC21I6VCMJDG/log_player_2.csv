"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price of $14000. This is a special opportunity to acquire a valuable asset worth significantly more than this amount, tailored specifically for your needs. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. Alice values the product at $12,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy this product. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm prepared to pay $13,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I am pleased to counteroffer at $13500 for the product. This price still represents a significant discount compared to its value, while also reflecting the current market conditions and your interest in the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is still a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next offer and he'll be forced to buy from John. It's better to secure the product at a price lower than John's while still saving a little money."
