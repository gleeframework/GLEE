{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for slightly less than $15,000 (Bob's valuation), aiming for $14,000 maximizes your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down a bit, while still ensuring you get a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Clear and Direct:** The message is concise, highlighting the product's value to Bob and presenting the offer as fair."
