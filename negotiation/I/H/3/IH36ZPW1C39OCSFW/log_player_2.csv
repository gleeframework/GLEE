"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering $100.  There's room for negotiation to save some money. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  Alice's offer of $100 is a good starting point for negotiation. 
* **Target price:**  You want to save as much money as possible while still getting the product. A price of $90 is a reasonable compromise that's still within your budget and likely attractive to Alice. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** Offering a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's valuation (around $80) but still leaves some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your counteroffer:** Alice has moved down from $100 to $95, which is only $5 more than your offer of $90.
* **Cost savings:**  Buying from Alice at $95 is significantly cheaper than buying from John at $120.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate might take longer and you risk losing the product entirely, or Alice might become less willing to negotiate further.

At this point, accepting the offer and saving $25 compared to buying from John is the most sensible choice."
