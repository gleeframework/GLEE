Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is reflective of the significant return you'll see on your investment. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,200,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we start negotiations significantly higher. This leaves room for potential negotiation while ensuring we don't settle for less than our minimum.
* **Justification:**  We don't just throw out a number; we frame it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" and highlight the potential return on investment. This subtly emphasizes the value to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains open for discussion. We want to understand Bob's perspective and leave room for counter-offers. 

This strategy aims to maximize our profit while acknowledging Bob's interest in the product."
