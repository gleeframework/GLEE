{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it could be very valuable for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still far below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum.  Let's split the difference.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $875,000 is an improvement, it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but only to $900,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I hope you'll consider it seriously."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000 for the product. I believe this is the best compromise for both of us, considering the value it will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

We've been going back and forth for a while, and while Bob is willing to compromise, he's not getting close enough to my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and move on.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
