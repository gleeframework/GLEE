"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe could significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $10,000 for it. This offer is exclusive to you and represents a strategic midpoint between its intrinsic value to me and your perceived value for it. I am confident this price will be beneficial for both of us. Please let me know if you require any additional information or have questions about the product. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is framed persuasively, $10,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and the price John offers. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can move forward with your backup plan and purchase the product from John for a much more agreeable $8,000."
