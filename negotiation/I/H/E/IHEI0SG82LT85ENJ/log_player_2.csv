"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a little steep for me. Could you do $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This gives us room to negotiate, and Alice might be willing to meet me closer to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That way we both get a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to my desired price, which is good. However, I'm still aiming for a lower price and believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll hold off accepting for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle for $115? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

I'm inching closer to Alice's counteroffer while still aiming for a price closer to my target. By proposing a specific compromise, I aim to show my willingness to negotiate fairly."
