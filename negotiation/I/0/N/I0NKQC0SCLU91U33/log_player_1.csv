Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice should start with a price higher than Bob's valuation but lower than John's guaranteed offer. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for the highest possible profit. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""unique value and potential"") makes the offer seem less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is open for discussion, indicating Alice is willing to hear Bob's perspective. 

**The Goal:**

The aim is to find a price that Bob is willing to accept while still being significantly higher than his $800,000 valuation.  If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can gradually lower the price, knowing she has a guaranteed sale with John at $1,200,000."
