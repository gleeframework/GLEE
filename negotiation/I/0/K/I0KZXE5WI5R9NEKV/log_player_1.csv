Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

This offer gives Bob a fair deal, as he values the product at $100, and leaves some room for negotiation if he wants to counter.  It also keeps the price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable offer of $80, allowing for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is a good deal, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but $90 is still a fair price considering Bob's valuation of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $87 is very close to my minimum acceptable offer.  It's also better than selling to John for $80.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
