"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $1,800,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  Let's find a middle ground - how about $1,900,000? I'm confident this product will bring a lot of value to your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I can be flexible, but I need to see a number closer to my previous offer. Would you be willing to consider $1,850,000?",1850000.0,Alice,5,
