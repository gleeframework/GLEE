Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a little higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can adjust the price based on his counteroffer or decide to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe $100 is a fair price considering my budget. Could you possibly meet me halfway at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation,  I'm not willing to go much lower than my minimum. John is a sure bet for a price that meets my minimum, so I'll sell to him."
