"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me. I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price considering the value it holds for your business.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,200,000. I am willing to pay up to $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  This product is worth a lot more, and I'm confident that you'll agree it's a valuable asset for your business.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's true value, while also being fair to both of us.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for coming down to $1,100,000. While I respect the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable to you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I understand your budget constraints, but I'm confident that this product will generate significant returns for your business. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price is still a great deal for you, considering the product's potential, and allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your flexibility, but unfortunately, $1,150,000 is still beyond my budget. I believe we've reached our limits here. I would like to suggest a final offer of $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be more within your range, allowing us to close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
