"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is significantly lower than my starting price, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $850,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you.  $750,000 is still a bit too low for me, considering the product's true value.  Let's split the difference - I'll come down to $800,000. This is my final offer, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept.",800000.0,Alice,5,
