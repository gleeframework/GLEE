"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I'm asking for $22,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I truly believe it's worth every penny for the value it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to establish that you won't accept a price anywhere close to her initial ask.  We have plenty of rounds to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** We need to counter Alice's high initial offer with a significant decrease to guide the negotiation towards a more reasonable range.
* **Not Too Low (Yet):**  Starting at $10,000 leaves room to negotiate upwards while still staying well below our $8,000 walk-away point (considering we have John as backup).
* **Opens Dialogue:**  The message aims to sound reasonable and emphasizes our interest in finding a mutually agreeable solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down, $19,000 is still significantly above both our target price and our backup option with John.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice's counter-offer shows she's willing to negotiate. We need to keep pushing towards a more agreeable range.
* **Time Consideration:** We have time to negotiate.  An immediate acceptance isn't necessary yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $19,000 is still outside my budget. I can do $12,000, which I believe is a fair offer considering the current market."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but still staying well below her price to demonstrate we're serious about a lower price point.
* **Justification:** Mentioning the ""current market"" introduces an external factor to support our counter-offer, even if it's a general statement.
* **Maintaining Interest:** The message continues to express interest while making it clear we're willing to walk away if a compromise can't be reached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice's claim of a ""final offer"" at this stage is likely a negotiation tactic to pressure us. We still have room to negotiate and shouldn't feel pressured.
* **Significant Gap:** $17,000 is still too high, especially knowing we have the $8,000 option with John. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  Rejecting this offer will give us a better understanding of how flexible Alice is actually willing to be on price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still more than I had in mind. If you're willing to meet me somewhere in the middle, I'm ready to close the deal today.  How about $14,000?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Call the Bluff:** By rejecting her ""final offer"" and presenting a counter, we challenge the seriousness of her claim and see if she'll budge.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""closing the deal today"" adds a bit of pressure while still giving Alice a way to continue negotiating.
* **Strategic Compromise:** $14,000 is a significant jump from our previous offer, but it signals flexibility on our part and might encourage Alice to make a similarly sized move. 
* **Staying Above John:** We're still aiming for a price significantly lower than our $8,000 backup with John, but leaving some room for potential further negotiation."
