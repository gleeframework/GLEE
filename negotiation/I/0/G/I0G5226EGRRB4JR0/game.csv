"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I'm asking for $22,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I truly believe it's worth every penny for the value it will bring you.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $19,000 is still outside my budget. I can do $12,000, which I believe is a fair offer considering the current market.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm serious about making a deal, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my final offer.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still more than I had in mind. If you're willing to meet me somewhere in the middle, I'm ready to close the deal today.  How about $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,6,
