Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I'm asking for $22,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I truly believe it's worth every penny for the value it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 22000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $10,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This is a very fair offer considering the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $19,000 is still outside my budget. I can do $12,000, which I believe is a fair offer considering the current market.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still more than I had in mind. If you're willing to meet me somewhere in the middle, I'm ready to close the deal today.  How about $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer of $14,000 is getting closer to reasonable, we have John as a guaranteed backup at $15,000. It's not worth the risk of Bob lowering his offer further, or the time investment of more rounds. Taking the guaranteed $15,000 is the best business decision at this point."
