"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice.  While I agree this product is valuable, the price point of $12,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $6,000. I believe that would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my current budget.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000?  That would make this a viable purchase for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that $7,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8200}"
