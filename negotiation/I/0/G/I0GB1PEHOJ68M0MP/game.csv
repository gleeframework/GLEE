"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
