"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its features and benefits, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price to leave room for negotiation and signal my budget. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message remains polite and expresses interest while clearly stating my price point. This keeps the negotiation open. 
* **Strategic Consideration:** I'm aware that Alice wants $12,000 and I have a backup option at $8,000. This offer tests the waters and gives Alice a chance to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I can offer it to you for $13,000.  This takes into account the quality and benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice came down slightly, $13,000 is still significantly higher than both my target price and my alternative option with John.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to move closer to a price I'd consider.  I want to see how low she's willing to go.
* **Leverage:** I still have the option of buying from John at $8,000, which gives me leverage in this negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate you working with me.  I could possibly go up to $7,000, but that's really the absolute highest I can go right now. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm doing it gradually to avoid overshooting.
* **Firm Limit:** Stating  $7,000 as my ""absolute highest"" adds some pressure and signals a point beyond which I'm less likely to budge.  
* **Open for Counter:**  I'm still leaving room for Alice to counter if she's truly not willing to go that low. This keeps the negotiation going."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding the value of this product. To be frank, $7,000 is too low for me to consider.  If I were to let it go for anything less than $11,000, I'd be losing money. So, here's my final offer: $11,000.  This is a really great deal, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is using a common negotiation tactic by declaring this her ""final offer.""  It's designed to create a sense of urgency, but it doesn't mean it's her absolute bottom line. 
* **Still Above Target:**  $11,000 is still significantly above my target price and my alternative option with John. 
* **Testing Resolve:**  I want to test Alice's resolve by rejecting this offer and seeing if she's willing to make any further concessions. I'm betting she'll be more flexible than she's letting on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I have to be honest, $11,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  That feels like a fair compromise to me. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** Offering $9,000 splits the difference between her ""final offer"" of $11,000 and my previous offer of $7,000. This is often a compelling negotiation tactic as it feels like a ""fair"" solution.
* **Staying Firm:** While I'm moving closer to her price, I'm still below her $11,000 and well below her initial asking price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but staying firm within a reasonable range.
* **Gauge Her Response:**  This offer will be a strong indicator of how flexible Alice is truly willing to be. If she rejects this, I may consider going up slightly, but I'll be prepared to walk away and take the $8,000 deal with John."
