"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its features and benefits, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this. What do you say?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $6,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I can offer it to you for $13,000.  This takes into account the quality and benefits it offers.  Let me know your thoughts.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate you working with me.  I could possibly go up to $7,000, but that's really the absolute highest I can go right now. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding the value of this product. To be frank, $7,000 is too low for me to consider.  If I were to let it go for anything less than $11,000, I'd be losing money. So, here's my final offer: $11,000.  This is a really great deal, what do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I have to be honest, $11,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  That feels like a fair compromise to me. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,6,
