"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for a great price of $140. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason: While $140 is close to my budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is likely willing to go lower to make a sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

Reason: I'm starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her value. This leaves room for negotiation while signaling I'm serious about buying but looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $110 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Alice is getting closer to her minimum, but I'm still willing to negotiate a bit further. There's room to go down before hitting my $110 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  How about $118? That's a fair price that works for me."",
""product_price"": 118
}
```

Reason: I'm inching closer to Alice's likely minimum while staying below her current offer. This keeps the negotiation moving and signals I'm willing to compromise, but not at the expense of a good deal."
