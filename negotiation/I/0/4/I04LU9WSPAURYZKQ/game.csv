"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. However, $12,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
