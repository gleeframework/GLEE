"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm open to negotiations. However, I do need to make a profit, so I'll start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $975,000.  This is a fair compromise and gets us much closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this work.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about making a deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
