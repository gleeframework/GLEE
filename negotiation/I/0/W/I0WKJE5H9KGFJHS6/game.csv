,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to take it off your hands for $90. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $95 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $92.50. That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us finalize the deal quickly.",92.5,Bob,4,
