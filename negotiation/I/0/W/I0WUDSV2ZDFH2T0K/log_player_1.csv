{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm trying to maximize my profit while still being reasonably competitive.  If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer, keeping in mind John's offer of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is too low to consider. I'll counter with a higher price, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $125?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to my value for the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
