"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $1,100,000. This is a good starting point as it's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if I want to continue negotiating with him or take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'd prefer to get the deal done, I'm not willing to settle for $900,000 when I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to John. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a compromise, as it's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John. While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.  I believe I can get a better price with another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm offering $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  This is the price John is offering, so I'm essentially giving Bob a last chance to buy the product at a fair price. If he rejects, I'll go with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is still not willing to meet my minimum price. With only 4 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation is too high. I'm going to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price, it's better to guarantee a fair price than risk losing out on the deal altogether."
