"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, while still getting a good price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we both can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $12,000. I'm feeling the pressure of the limited rounds and the fallback option of John's offer, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial goal.  This offer is a compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $10,500. While it's not ideal, it's significantly better than selling to John for $10,000. With only four rounds left, the risk of further negotiation is high, and I don't want to risk ending up with John's offer.  I'm closing the deal with Bob to secure a better price."
