"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity. My product is worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be even more valuable in your hands.  I'm prepared to let it go for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $850,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
