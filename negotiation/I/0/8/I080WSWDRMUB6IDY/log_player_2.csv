Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,750,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product,  which reflects its value and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,400,000 is below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my budget.  I can try to negotiate a bit further to see if I can get it down to my desired price. There are still rounds remaining, and there's a chance we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000.  This would allow for a significant profit for you while still staying within my budget.  Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it reflects my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to go above $1,500,000.  Since I have the option to buy from John for that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. I'll try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This would allow you to sell the product at a fair price while still meeting my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
