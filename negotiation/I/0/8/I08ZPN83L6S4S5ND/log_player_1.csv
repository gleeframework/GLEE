Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, given my financial situation, I can't go above $12500 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It seems like Bob is unwilling to go above $12,500, which is still below my minimum value of $15,000. With only 4 rounds remaining, it's getting increasingly difficult to get closer to my desired price.  

To avoid further negotiations and ensure I get a fair price, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
