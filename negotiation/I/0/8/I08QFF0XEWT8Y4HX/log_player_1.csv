{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I can sell to John for the same price."
