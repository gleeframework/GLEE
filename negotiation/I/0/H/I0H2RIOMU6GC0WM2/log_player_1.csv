{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be extremely valuable to your business. My initial asking price is $1,200,000. This reflects the product's high quality and potential for significant ROI.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, I think $1,200,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.

This price still offers significant value for your business, and I'm confident it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is closer, but I'd need to be closer to $950,000 to make this work. Would that be feasible? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
