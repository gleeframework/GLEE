Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm also trying to be friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $65 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 
I'm offering a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for some potential negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to hopefully encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $90 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $70. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Rather than continue to negotiate with Bob, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  This is a better outcome for me than accepting Bob's offer, and it ensures that I don't have to continue negotiating with Bob."
