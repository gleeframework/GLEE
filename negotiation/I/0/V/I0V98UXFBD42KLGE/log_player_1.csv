Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little steep for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer.  While $70 is better than nothing, I can likely get more if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $78?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $78 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'll counteroffer one more time."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $78 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit away. How about we settle on $82? This is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 82}
