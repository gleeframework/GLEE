"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $12000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm willing to offer $9500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a compromise at $11000. This is still a great deal considering the value the product can bring to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $10500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be valuable to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you $11200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value the product can bring to you. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
