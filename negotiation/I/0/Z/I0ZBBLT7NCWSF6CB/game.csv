"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to save some money, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $6,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but I'm willing to compromise to make a deal.",6000.0,Alice,3,
