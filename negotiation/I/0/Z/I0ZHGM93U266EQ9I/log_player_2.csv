# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1200000. What are your thoughts?

Bob should reject the initial offer.  He's aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, and Alice's offer is still too high. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you a price of $1175000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm seeing if we can bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal.  Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm not willing to go any lower than this. This is a compromise, but I think it's the best we can do. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been negotiating with Alice for a few rounds, and while they're getting closer to a deal, Alice is still unwilling to go lower than $1,150,000.  Bob's goal is to get the product for under $1,000,000, and it's looking increasingly likely that Alice won't budge. 

Given this situation, Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  This guarantees him the product at his desired price, and it saves him the time and effort of continuing to negotiate with Alice."
