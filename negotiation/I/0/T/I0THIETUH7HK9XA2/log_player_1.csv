**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to our acceptable range, his offers are increasing in smaller increments.  At this stage, it's unlikely we'll be able to negotiate a price significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000.  Therefore, it makes the most business sense to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
