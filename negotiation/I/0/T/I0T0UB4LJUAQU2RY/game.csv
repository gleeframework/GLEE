"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is unfortunately higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is my maximum.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $13,500 for the product. Can we meet at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm committed to buying this product, but I can't go beyond my budget of $10,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. Would you be willing to consider $11,000 as a compromise?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're committed to buying the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Can we meet at $13,750?",13750.0,Alice,5,
