"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

This counter-offer aims to bring the price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $11,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but there's still room to negotiate before reaching our walk-away price. We'll counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,750?"", 
""product_price"": 10750
}
``` 

We are inching closer to Alice's valuation and offering a seemingly 'fair' middle ground. This approach aims to entice Alice while keeping us well below our walk-away price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,750 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $10,900.  This is my final offer, and I really believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and while it's not the absolute lowest we could potentially go, it's a good deal. Accepting avoids the risk of pushing her away and having to settle for John's higher price."
