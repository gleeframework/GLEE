Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $18,000, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counter-offer is more likely to be favorable than if you had started lower.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John, so there's little risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, he'll try to get it for less. Understanding his negotiation tactics and potential constraints would be beneficial in real-world scenarios.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a positive long-term relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive starting price might be more appropriate."
