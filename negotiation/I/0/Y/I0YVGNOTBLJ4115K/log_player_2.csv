"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $11,500. I think it would be very valuable to you, and this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $11,000.** This is still better than John's price of $12,000.
* **Bob has already rejected a lower offer.** This shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product and willing to pay a fair price.
* **Further negotiation might be time-consuming.**  There's no guarantee that Bob can get a lower price from Alice, and delaying the purchase could risk losing the product altogether.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer at $11,000 is the best option for Bob to maximize his savings while still securing the product."
