Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $95 is slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still a tempting discount from your guaranteed price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $95, there's a slight chance Bob might counter-offer, giving you an opportunity to still sell above your minimum. 

This approach aims to balance maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
