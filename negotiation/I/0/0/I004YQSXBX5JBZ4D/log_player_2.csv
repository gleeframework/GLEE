Round 9

This is the best move at this stage. Here's why:

* **Alice has reached her bottom line:** Alice has explicitly stated this is the lowest she'll go. 
* **Saving $200,000:** Buying at $800,000 is a significant saving compared to John's $1,000,000 offer.
* **Time is running out:**  You only have one round left, and there's no guarantee you can get a better deal in that time. 

Accepting Alice's offer now secures the best possible price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
