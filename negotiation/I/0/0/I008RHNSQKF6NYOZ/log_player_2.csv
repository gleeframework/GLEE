(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

While $1,250,000 is closer to your budget, it's still a significant amount above John's offer. There's still room for negotiation with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's a significant amount lower than Alice's current offer, but still higher than John's price, indicating your willingness to negotiate further. This might convince Alice to come down a bit more, or at least gives you a better price than John's."
