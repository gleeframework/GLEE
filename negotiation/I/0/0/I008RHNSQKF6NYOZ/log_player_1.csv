Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  I'm hoping Bob values it even more, but I'm also prepared to negotiate.  This offer gives me room to adjust the price down if needed without sacrificing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not willing to settle for Bob's initial offer. I know the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, and I'm going to try to get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm coming down from my initial offer, but still holding out for a price that reflects the value of the product.  $1,250,000 is a fair compromise, and I'm confident Bob will see the value in that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up from his initial offer, and while it's not my ideal price, $1,100,000 is a significant improvement.  It's a good deal, and I'm willing to accept it rather than risk further negotiation with Bob or selling to John for a lower price."
