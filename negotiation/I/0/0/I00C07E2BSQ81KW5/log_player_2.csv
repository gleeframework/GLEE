# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that my initial price was a bit high. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm confident you'll find it's worth that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $140 is still a bit out of my budget. How about $100? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. $100 is a bit too low for me to accept, but I'm willing to come down to $125. This is my final offer, as I know I can sell it for a similar price elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $125 is close to your budget, you know you have the option to buy the product from John for $120.  It makes more sense to secure the lower price with John rather than risk Alice not budging from her ""final offer."""
