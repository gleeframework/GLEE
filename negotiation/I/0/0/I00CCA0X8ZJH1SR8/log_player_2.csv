{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price.  There's also the option of buying from John, so you have leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. This is a strong starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down. I am also keeping in mind the option to buy from John for $1,000,000."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it is still above my maximum budget. I will continue to negotiate to see if I can get a better price. I can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $900,000, which is still within my budget and closer to Alice's last offer.  This shows that I am serious about buying the product but am still trying to get a good deal. I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option of buying from John for $1,000,000."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  However, we are getting closer to a price I'm willing to accept.  I want to see if I can get Alice to come down even further before I buy from John.  It's a risk, but I think I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a smaller amount. This shows that I'm getting closer to accepting, but still want a price lower than Alice's last offer. This also leaves some room for negotiation if Alice is willing to come down a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally come down to my maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's no point in continuing to negotiate as I can get the product for the same price from John. I'll accept the offer and avoid further negotiations."
