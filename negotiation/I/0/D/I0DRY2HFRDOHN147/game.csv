"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $90 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $95. This would be a fair price for both of us and a great value for you. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $80, so I'm thinking $92.50. Would you be willing to meet me there?",92.5,Bob,4,
