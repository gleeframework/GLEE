Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob, emphasizing potential value.
* **Room for Compromise:** By starting at $110, I have room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, potentially reaching a price that benefits both of us.
* **John as Backup:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay $100, so I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum price of $100, but still below what I ideally want. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to $100, hoping to reach a compromise.
* **John's Offer:**  While John's offer of $100 is tempting, I'm willing to take a slight risk to see if I can get a better price from Bob.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $90 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $95. This would be a fair price for both of us and a great value for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Fair Value:** I'm framing the $95 as a ""fair price"" for both of us, emphasizing mutual benefit.
* **Strategic Approach:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation but also sets a clear limit, moving us closer to a potential agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $80, so I'm thinking $92.50. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer of $92.5 is very close to my desired price point of $100, especially considering he's already rejected my previous offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might become less willing to compromise, or that I might ultimately need to sell to John for $100. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** Accepting this offer minimizes potential losses and ensures a sale at a price that's close to my minimum.

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to avoid further risk and secure a sale at a price that's beneficial to me."
