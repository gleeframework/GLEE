"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to make you an offer. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a reasonable cost. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's a good price for her, it's still over your budget.  You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for my product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for more than you're willing to pay.  While she's moved closer to your counteroffer, $900,000 is still outside your budget. You're better off rejecting and trying to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This price allows for a fair deal for both of us, and it's the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for my product. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your target price, but $875,000 is still a bit high. You're only $75,000 away from your maximum budget, and you've already shown a willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $875,000 is still just a little out of my reach. I'm willing to go to $860,000. This is my absolute final offer, and it gives you a solid price for your product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I still think the product is worth more than $860,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $880,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, her final offer of $880,000 is still too high. You're only $80,000 away from your maximum budget, but the risk of further negotiation not yielding a better result is high. John's offer of $800,000 is within your budget and a sure thing.  Therefore, it's in your best interest to close the deal with John and save the time and effort of further negotiation."
