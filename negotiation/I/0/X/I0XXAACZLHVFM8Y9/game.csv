"Alice, your offer is still a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for my product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that I believe will benefit both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This price allows for a fair deal for both of us, and it's the maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $850,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for my product. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the value of the product.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $875,000 is still just a little out of my reach. I'm willing to go to $860,000. This is my absolute final offer, and it gives you a solid price for your product. Let's close this deal!",860000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I still think the product is worth more than $860,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $880,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",880000.0,Alice,7,
