"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle on $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $95, Bob. I think the product is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here. $100 is my limit for this product. If you're willing to sell it for that price, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $100. However, I'm willing to meet you at a price that's very close to that. I can offer it to you for $110, but I'm not budging from there.",110.0,Alice,7,
