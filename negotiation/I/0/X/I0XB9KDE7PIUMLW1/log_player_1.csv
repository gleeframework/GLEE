Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price gives Bob some wiggle room to counter without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **Protecting my Value:**  I'm not willing to go below $12,000, as that's my minimum. John is a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and am willing to pay $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $12,000 I need. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I'm not desperate for a sale.  I believe I can potentially get a higher price from Bob by counteroffering.
* **John is my Safety Net:**  If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can still get my minimum price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down to $9,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within a reasonable range:** My counteroffer is a small decrease from my initial price, showing flexibility while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I reiterate the value of the product, hoping to persuade Bob that $9,750 is a fair price.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I end the message with a question, keeping the negotiation open for Bob to potentially accept or counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $9,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is stagnant:** Bob has stuck with his $9,500 offer, and I believe further negotiation will not yield a higher price.
* **Risk of deadlock:**  If I keep counteroffering, I risk reaching a stalemate and losing valuable time. 
* **John offers a guaranteed minimum:** By selling to John, I guarantee myself my minimum price of $12,000.  This is a safer and more profitable option than continuing the negotiation with Bob."
