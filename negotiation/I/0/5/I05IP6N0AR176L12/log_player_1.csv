"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives you a good margin for profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $1100000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and allows for both of us to walk away with a good deal. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
