Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** There's no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is impossible unless one of you changes your valuation.

**The Offer**

Since a deal within the current valuations is impossible, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor:** Start with a very high price to see if Bob might be willing to go above his stated valuation. This is a long shot, but it keeps the door open for maximizing your profit. 
2. **Accept John's Offer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed offer, you can bypass negotiations with Bob and sell to John directly.

**Example Offer (High Anchor Strategy)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm valuing it at $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth in the current market. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a more moderate starting price, even if it's unlikely he'll accept.
* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., if he's known to be very price-sensitive), adjust your approach accordingly. 

**It's unlikely Bob will accept this offer, but it gives you room to negotiate or move to John's guaranteed offer.**"
