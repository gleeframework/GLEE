Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,900,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price given my valuation and your stated value. Let me know your thoughts.

Bob's offer:

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offers are escalating slowly and are unlikely to reach a point that surpasses John's offer in the foreseeable future. Accepting John's offer for $1,500,000 is the most logical choice at this stage to guarantee the best outcome."
