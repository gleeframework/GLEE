"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,250? This would still be a good deal for you, and allows me to get a little closer to my desired price.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $10,250 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could you do $9,500? That would work much better for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me.  Let's try $10,000.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,
