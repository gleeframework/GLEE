"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to both of us, and I'm confident we can find a price that's fair.  Let's start with $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is tempting, I need to stay above $1 million to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise at $1,050,000. This gives us both a good return. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000, but I'd like to see if we can do even better. What do you think?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
