Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to both of us, and I'm confident we can find a price that's fair.  Let's start with $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or at least find a middle ground.  It's too early to sell to John, as I haven't exhausted all options with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is tempting, I need to stay above $1 million to make this worthwhile.  Let's compromise at $1,050,000. This gives us both a good return. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,025,000, but I'd like to see if we can do even better. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'd prefer a higher price, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to ensure I secure a sale. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still an option, but I believe I can achieve a slightly better outcome with Bob."
