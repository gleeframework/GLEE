Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to make a serious offer. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still slightly above it. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can still buy from John for $800,000 if the deal doesn't work out with Alice."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm not willing to go below $820000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $820000. If not, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above Bob's target price.  It's unlikely that further negotiation will result in a lower price. With only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal increases.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to purchase the product from John for $800,000, ensuring he gets the product within his budget and avoiding further negotiation uncertainty."
