{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a bold move, but it establishes my willingness to negotiate and sets a clear target for a lower price.  I'm hoping to entice Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $12,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can reach a mutually acceptable price. There are still several rounds remaining, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to meet her halfway. $11,500 is a reasonable compromise that's still within my budget while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, but $13,500 is still over my budget.  I want to see if I can push for a price closer to my maximum.  I'm also aware that if I don't close the deal within the next few rounds, I have the option to buy from John.  However, I still believe there's room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again to $12,500. This is a significant compromise, bringing me closer to Alice's price.  However, I believe this offer is still reasonable considering my budget and the fact that there are only four rounds left. I'm aiming to make a final push to see if Alice will accept this offer. If she doesn't, I'll be prepared to either buy from John or make a final counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $12,000. However, we are close to a deal, and I want to see if I can still negotiate a lower price. There are only three rounds left, and I believe a counteroffer with a slight increase from my last offer might be enough to reach an agreement. If she rejects my offer, I'll have to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final counteroffer, slightly increasing my previous offer to $12,750. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the remaining rounds. 

My reasoning is:

- **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, I need to make a strong move to incentivize Alice to accept.
- **Closing the gap:** $12,750 is a relatively small difference from Alice's offer, making it more appealing than my previous counteroffer.
- **Avoiding John:** While I can still buy from John, I prefer to get the product from Alice if possible, as the negotiation process has been engaging, and we're close to a deal.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enough to convince Alice to accept and finalize the purchase."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is within my budget and is the closest we've come to a deal. With only one round left, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid the risk of losing the deal altogether. While I would have preferred to get the product for $12,000, accepting this offer is the best option to ensure I get the product within my budget and before the deadline."
