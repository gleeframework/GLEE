"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will benefit your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm afraid I can't accept an offer of $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. To be completely transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $950,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to compromise further, though. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my own minimum acceptable price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but to show I'm serious, I can offer $1,000,000.  I need to stay firm at this price point.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer of $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my own minimum acceptable price.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
