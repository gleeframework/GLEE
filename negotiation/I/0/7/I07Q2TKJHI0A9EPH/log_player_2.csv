Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm afraid I can't accept an offer of $800,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,025,000.  Continuing to push for a lower price could annoy her and risk the deal. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable price for you."
