"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I believe it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob should reject the offer.  $10,000 is too high, and he can likely get a better price.  He should counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $10,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his ideal price. He should continue to negotiate.  It's possible Alice is willing to come down further, or Bob can buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested, but $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
