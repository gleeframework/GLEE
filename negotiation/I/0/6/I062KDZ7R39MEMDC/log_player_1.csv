Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before anyone else. I believe it's a great deal at $11,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to sell ourselves short.  There's always a chance he might be willing to go higher, especially if he perceives a sense of urgency or exclusivity. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $11,500 allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. We can always go down, but we can't go up from our initial offer.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a secure offer from John at $10,000.  This gives us leverage in knowing we don't *have* to go below that price."
