Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to counteroffer at $95. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's risky to sell to John for $80 when Bob has already shown a willingness to pay more. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $95 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm confident this price is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position. I'd like to counteroffer at $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $100 is a good deal. It's much better than selling to John for $80.  While I could try to push for more, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
