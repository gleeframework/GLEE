I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum of $1,500,000, but it gives Bob room to negotiate. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum price. This strategy aims for the best possible outcome, maximizing my profit while leaving space for a deal."
