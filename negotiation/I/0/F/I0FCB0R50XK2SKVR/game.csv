"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $750000. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a new price of $775000. I think this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. I propose a price of $825000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your willingness to make one more counteroffer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $775000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers and propose a new price of $800000. I think this is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",800000.0,Bob,6,
