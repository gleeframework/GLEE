"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I'm confident that you'll find it's worth every penny.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a good price, but I'm still not convinced that it's enough to cover the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,100,000, which would be $1,175,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my needs.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
