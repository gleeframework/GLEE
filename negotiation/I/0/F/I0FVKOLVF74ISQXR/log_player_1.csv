Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price of $130, which is above my minimum and leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially make a good profit while giving Bob a chance to get the product at a price that's still advantageous to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm counter-offering at $115,  which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Since John is willing to pay the same amount, I'll choose to sell the product to John and avoid further negotiation."
