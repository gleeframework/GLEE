Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I am offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's incredibly valuable to you, potentially worth $1,000,000.  I'm willing to make this deal happen for $1,900,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both you (Alice) and Bob, aiming high initially gives room for negotiation. 
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer in John at $1,000,000 provides a strong fallback position. Bob doesn't need to know this specific amount, but implying you have other options can encourage him to accept a higher price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perception:**  This strategy assumes Bob doesn't know your absolute bottom line. If he knows you'll accept $1,000,000, he'll never offer more.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive starting price might be preferable."
