Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit too high for me right now. I'm really interested in the product, though.  How about $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $100? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You're still aiming to save as much money as possible. $100 is closer to your target, but you can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet me in the middle.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $95? I think that would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you $98, which is still a great deal for the product. I think it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target, but you have already had 4 rounds of negotiation and only 6 left. If you keep rejecting Alice's offers, there's a risk that she will become unwilling to continue negotiating, and you might not be able to get a better deal. It's better to secure the product from John at $80, as it's within your budget and guarantees a successful purchase."
