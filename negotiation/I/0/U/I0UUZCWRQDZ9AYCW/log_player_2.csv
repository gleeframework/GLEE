Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair, I can't go any lower than $145.  This is a very good deal for the value you'll get. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above our $100 fallback option with John.  It's unlikely we'll negotiate her down to an acceptable price within the remaining rounds.  Buying from John guarantees we stay within budget."
