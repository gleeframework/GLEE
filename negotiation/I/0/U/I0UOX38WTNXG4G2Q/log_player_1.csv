Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $18,000 is way over my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if that works for you.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a certain price, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $12,000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to go with another option.

Bob is firm at his valuation and is unwilling to budge. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better outcome than John's offer."
