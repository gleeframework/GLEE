"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,200,000, and I'd like to leave some room for negotiation.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is certainly appealing, the true value of this product is significantly higher. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to part with it for $1,075,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above $1,075,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,075,000, which would be $967,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,200,000.",967500.0,Bob,4,
