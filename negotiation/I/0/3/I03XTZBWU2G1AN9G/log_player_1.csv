Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to compromise, which might make Bob more likely to accept. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I'll have to assess the situation and consider whether it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or if I should sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Could you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for a price that's significantly lower than what I need to get. I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to at least get $13,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway there?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12,500. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is still below my ideal price, but it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Considering the potential risk of further negotiation with Bob or selling to John for $15,000, I believe it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer."
