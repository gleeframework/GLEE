"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's above your maximum budget and you can get the product for significantly less from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, but if she doesn't come down to a reasonable price, you have a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's close to my maximum price. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  While it's closer to my budget, it's still not a great deal.  I'm going to continue to negotiate with Alice in hopes of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise.  However, I'm still staying below my maximum price point. This is a reasonable compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not going to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still slightly above my maximum budget. I'm not willing to go over $1,200,000, so I'm going to continue negotiating. There's still a good chance she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but I'm still staying below my maximum budget. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while also showing Alice that I'm serious about making a deal. It's a risky move, but I believe it's the best way to get Alice to lower her price even further."
