"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,700,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe that by starting high, I can establish a good starting point and hopefully secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm reducing my price to $1,600,000. This is still a significant profit for me and closer to Bob's perceived value. I'm hoping that by showing some flexibility, I can encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not happy with the offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating with Bob. There's still room for improvement, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement that is more beneficial to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm making a final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob.  This offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If Bob rejects this offer, I will move on to selling the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not confident that I can get a better offer from Bob.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  This ensures I get the value I want for the product."
