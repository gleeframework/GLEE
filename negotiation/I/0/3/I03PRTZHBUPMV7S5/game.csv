"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that starting price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This price reflects the value it holds and leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we need to find a price point that works for both of us. While I appreciate the reduction,  $1,400,000 is still too high. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
