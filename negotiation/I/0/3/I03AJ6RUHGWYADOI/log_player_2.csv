"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $150. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers. It's best to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $150 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that you're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The message is polite and acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating your budget constraints.
* **Targeting a Win-Win:** The goal is to land on a price that's good for you but also potentially acceptable to Alice (remember, her value is $120)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price and what John is offering. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate the compromise.  To be honest, $100 is the absolute highest I can go. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer makes it clear that $100 is your maximum price. Being upfront avoids unnecessary back and forth.
* **Justification:** By stating it's the ""absolute highest"" you can go, you add weight to your offer.
* **Opens the Door:** Phrasing it as a question (""Would that work for you?"") keeps the conversation going and invites Alice to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your absolute limit, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $115. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise to find a deal that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached a Stalemate:** Alice is unwilling to meet your maximum price of $100.
* **Better Alternative:** John offers the product for $100, which aligns perfectly with your budget. 
* **Avoid Further Negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice might not yield a better outcome and could waste time."
