"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering, Alice. I appreciate the compromise.  To be honest, $100 is the absolute highest I can go. Would that work for you?",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is your absolute limit, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $115. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise to find a deal that works for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
