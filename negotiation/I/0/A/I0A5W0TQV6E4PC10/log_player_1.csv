Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $120 initially leaves room for negotiation and ensures you're not giving away too much value right away. 
* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  Since you know the product is worth $150 to Bob, there's potential for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Protecting Your Minimum:** The $80 minimum from John gives you a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  While $100 is closer to your minimum, there's still room to negotiate.  You know the product is worth more to Bob, so you can try to bridge the gap further.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to explore a higher price, potentially getting closer to your desired range.
* **Avoiding ""Selling Low"":**  Selling to John for $80 is a last resort.  Since you're still in a strong negotiating position, it's better to explore other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? It's still a fair price for the value of the product, and it's closer to your target."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  Offering $110 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, demonstrating a good-faith effort to close the deal.
* **Strategic Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while getting closer to Bob's preferred price. 
* **Building on Rejection:** Since Bob rejected $100, this counteroffer presents a more appealing alternative that might be more likely to be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose $95 as my maximum offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching Minimum:**  $95 is only $5 away from my minimum of $80. 
* **Potential Loss:** If I reject and try to counter, Bob may walk away, leaving me with only the $80 offer from John.
* **Closing the Deal:** Accepting $95 ensures a sale and a profit, which is better than risking a stalemate or selling to John for less."
