Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $987,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so my counteroffer is $1,012,500. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's getting close to the wire, and Alice seems firm on her price. Accepting the offer at $1,012,500 is a good deal considering your alternatives:

* **Continuing Negotiation:**  You risk Alice sticking to her guns, leaving you with a worse outcome than the current offer.
* **Buying from John:** Paying $1,200,000 is significantly more expensive.

Taking the deal now secures a significant saving compared to John's price."
