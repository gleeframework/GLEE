"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we settle around $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far off from what I had in mind.  Would you consider $950,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so my counteroffer is $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm definitely still interested.  How about we split the difference and call it $987,500?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",987500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $987,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, so my counteroffer is $1,012,500. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",1012500.0,Alice,7,
