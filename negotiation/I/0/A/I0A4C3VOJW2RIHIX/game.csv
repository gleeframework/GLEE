"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,100,000. I'm willing to consider $950,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which still gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. ",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. Can we shake on it at this price?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
