"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $850,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $975,000. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's try to reach an agreement here.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on this product. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
