"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. It's too high, and you can definitely do better.  You'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to pay $850,000 for this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit high for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $975,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

While Alice has lowered her price, $975,000 is still higher than your maximum. You should reject the offer and try to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's try to reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm thinking of offering you the product for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, you should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still higher than your ideal price, it's close to your maximum.  Continuing to negotiate risks that Alice will walk away, or that you'll spend too much time haggling.  It's better to secure the product at a price that's still within your budget."
