Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  It leaves room for negotiation, but is still attractive to Bob.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  By not immediately asking for the full $150, you're signaling to Bob that you're flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than $80, I'm going to try and get closer to my ideal price. I'll counter with a price closer to $100.  I can still sell to John if I don't get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $100? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get closer to $100, $95 is a good price and it's still better than the $80 I'd get from John.  I want to avoid further negotiation and get the sale done."
