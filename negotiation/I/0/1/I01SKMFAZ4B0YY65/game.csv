,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $95, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you at $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I really appreciate you being flexible, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $98, which is closer to my budget. Would you consider that?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $105 is too high, but I can do $102. What do you think?",102.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, but $102 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's meet in the middle at $99. I'm confident we can close this deal if we can find some common ground.",99.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $99, but I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $101. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",101.0,Alice,9,
