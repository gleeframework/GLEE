Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a special price of $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $11,500 is still significantly below my minimum but above Bob's perceived value. This creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays with John or other buyers.

**Important Note:** This offer assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limitations beyond his perceived product value."
