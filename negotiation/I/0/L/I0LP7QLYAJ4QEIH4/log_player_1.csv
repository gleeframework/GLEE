Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) sets an anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the final price is more likely to be closer to your desired range.
* **Exclusivity:**  Framing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds perceived value and might make Bob more inclined to accept a higher price.
* **Confidence:** The language used is confident and emphasizes the product's worth, further justifying the high price. 

**Important Note:**  While this strategy aims for a higher profit, there's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, having John as a backup mitigates this risk."
