Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts high, but it's still below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the value proposition for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I can't afford $9,500 for the product. Could you consider lowering the price to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I can still try to get a better price.  It's risky to sell to John immediately, as I might be able to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm open to $9,000. This would still be a great price for you, as you'd be getting the product for less than its value to you.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
