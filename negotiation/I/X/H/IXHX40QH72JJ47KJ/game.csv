"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that's worth $10000 to you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value. How about we split the difference and go with $8500? ",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to pay closer to the product's value, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $9200? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to come down from my initial offer.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9200 is still a bit high for me. Since we both want to make this work, I'm proposing $8750. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to come out ahead.  What do you think? ",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $9000. How about we meet at $9100? It's a fair compromise that still leaves room for both of us to make a profit.",9100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  I'm ready to make a final compromise, but I need to stay at or under $8900. How about we settle on $8900? It's a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals. ",8900.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to find a final compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8900. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above $9000. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9050. It's a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to make a profit.",9050.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up to $9000, which is my absolute limit.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it will let us finalize this transaction. ",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above my minimum price of $8000 that I can get from John. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9050. It's a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to make a profit.",9050.0,Alice,9,
