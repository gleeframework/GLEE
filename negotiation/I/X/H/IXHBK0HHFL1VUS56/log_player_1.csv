Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Alice's Minimum:** Alice won't sell for less than $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice should aim for a price closer to Bob's valuation while staying above her minimum. 
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering the product at $12,000 splits the difference between Bob's valuation and a profitable price for Alice. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still ensures Alice a significant profit.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a multi-round negotiation, Alice might start with a higher offer."
