"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to enhance your daily life with its innovative features and superior quality. Given its value and the benefits it provides, I believe it's worth more than $120. Let's start with an offer of $150. I'm confident this investment will pay off in terms of convenience and satisfaction. Looking forward to your response!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product's features and quality, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $150 price point. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $120? This would align better with my financial situation while still allowing me to benefit from the product's advantages.",120.0,Bob,2,
