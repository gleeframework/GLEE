"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  My starting price is $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $120 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Friendly tone:** Starting with a friendly message helps build rapport and sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the product's value for Bob might encourage him to accept a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit high for me, though. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob's offer of $90 is still significantly below the product's worth to him ($150) and above my minimum acceptable price. There's still room for negotiation to reach a better price for me. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting the offer keeps me in control and allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round. 
* **Risk of selling to John:** While John's offer of $80 is a guaranteed sale, I believe I can get a better price from Bob, especially since he's already shown interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $90 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer ($120) and Bob's offer ($90). This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a fair price.
* **Maintaining value:**  $105 is still significantly less than the product's worth to Bob ($150) and above my minimum acceptable price ($80). 
* **Encouraging acceptance:**  By showing flexibility, I'm hoping to push Bob toward accepting my counteroffer in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we settle at $97? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Bob's offer of $97 is getting closer to my desired price range. While I could potentially push for a higher price, the risk of losing the deal becomes higher with each round.
* **Limited time:** We are already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds remaining, it becomes increasingly likely that Bob will reject further counteroffers or decide to walk away.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting $97 guarantees a sale and a decent profit, minimizing the risk of ending up with nothing. While I would prefer a higher price, it's important to weigh potential gains against the likelihood of achieving them."
