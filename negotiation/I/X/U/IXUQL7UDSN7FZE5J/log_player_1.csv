Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $10,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at $15,000. Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation and potentially securing a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at broader value (""perfect for your needs"") and scarcity (""before I list it publicly"") to justify the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room:** While the offer is high, it's not so outrageous as to be immediately offensive to Bob. It leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, starting a negotiation.

**Important Note:** Alice needs to be prepared to potentially lower her price slightly if Bob negotiates. However, her guaranteed sale to John gives her leverage in the negotiation."
