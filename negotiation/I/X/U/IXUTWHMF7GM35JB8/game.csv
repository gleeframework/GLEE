"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. This is the maximum I can afford, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm sticking with my offer of $12000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $12000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $13000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
