"Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you're interested.  I'm happy to come down a bit, but I'm not able to go as low as $90. How about $100? That's still a great price for the product, and it gives us both a good deal.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $100 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  But I can't go lower than $105.  That's a fair compromise, and it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,5,
