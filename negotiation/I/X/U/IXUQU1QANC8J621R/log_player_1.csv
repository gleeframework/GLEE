Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $16,000 for this product.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I have 6 rounds remaining with Bob, and I believe I can get closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000."

{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $15,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 15000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $15,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $14,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  It's my minimum acceptable price, and I'm only halfway through the negotiations with Bob.  There's no guarantee that he will meet my price, and I don't want to risk losing a sure thing with John."
