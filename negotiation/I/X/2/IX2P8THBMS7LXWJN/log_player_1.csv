"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially get closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm  countering with $10,500, which is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to my desired price point.  I'm hoping this will incentivize him to move closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will get me closer to my desired price. Since John is offering my minimum acceptable price, it's a safer bet to sell to John and guarantee my desired profit."
