Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's better than nothing, I can still try to get closer to my minimum price of $150."

``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer of $140.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my $150 minimum, it's getting late in the negotiation and selling to Bob is still better than selling to John for $150.  There's also a chance I could get a better offer in the next round, but it's risky to keep going."
