,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $7500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8500. That's a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $8500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $8250. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",8250.0,Bob,4,
