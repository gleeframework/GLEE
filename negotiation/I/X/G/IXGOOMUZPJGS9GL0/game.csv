"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider a price closer to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. If you're genuinely interested, let's close this deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,275,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my means. Can you meet me at that price?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
