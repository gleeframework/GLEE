Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum value of $80.
* **Lower than Bob's value:** This leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win outcome. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting this offer allows me to counter-offer and hopefully close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit low for me. How about $110? That's a fair compromise, and we can both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my initial offer but still lower than Bob's value. This shows flexibility and a willingness to find a middle ground, which could increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $105? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $105 is a good compromise.  It's significantly higher than selling to John, and it seems like Bob is firm on this price.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a reasonable profit."
