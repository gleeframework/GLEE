"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe the value it brings to your business will far exceed the price. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While selling to John for $1,000,000 is tempting, there's still potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob. Rejecting his offer allows for another round of negotiation, potentially leading to a deal closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I need to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the true value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I must stick to my budget. I am now offering $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. By continuing to negotiate, I might be able to push Bob to a price closer to $1,100,000. There are still 6 rounds left, which gives me enough time to try to close the deal at a more profitable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer.  However, $1,050,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering the product for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I am willing to go up to $1,025,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and Bob's offer is still not reaching my minimum desired price.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't have enough time to close the deal with Bob at a more profitable price.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I reach my minimum goal."
