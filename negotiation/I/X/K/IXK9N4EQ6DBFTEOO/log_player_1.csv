Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and the unique benefits it offers. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000 and it's worth the same to me even if he refuses, we have room to negotiate. Starting high allows for potential negotiation downwards.
* **Justification:**  Simply stating a high price isn't enough. The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""immense value"" to create a perception of higher worth.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, opening the door for a mutually agreeable price that's still potentially higher than our guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes we have no prior information about Bob's negotiation style. If we knew he was particularly averse to high starting prices, a different approach might be necessary.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If there's a time constraint, we might adjust our strategy to be more aggressive or flexible depending on the urgency."
