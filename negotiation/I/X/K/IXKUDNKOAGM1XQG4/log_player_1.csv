Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my valuation.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 

By starting with a strong offer, I increase the likelihood of securing a deal with Bob at a price that's beneficial for both of us. If he rejects it, I can always fall back on my agreement with John."
