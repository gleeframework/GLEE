Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's higher than your minimum price of $12,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a clear incentive to accept, knowing he'll still make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway. I'm confident Bob will accept, as it's still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get closer to my original offer, Bob's counteroffer is only slightly lower than my last offer.  It's better than selling to John, so I'll accept it."
