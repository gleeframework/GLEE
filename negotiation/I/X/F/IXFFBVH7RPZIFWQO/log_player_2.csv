"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. It's a steal at this price, and I think it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth exploring if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you showing me the product. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I still believe the product is worth more than $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. It's a compromise that I think will benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my budget. I'm still hoping to get the product for closer to my $8,000 limit. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and your previous offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is still above my budget, and we're only halfway through the negotiation process.  It seems unlikely that we'll be able to reach an agreement at a price I'm comfortable with. It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John for $8,000 rather than risk losing the product altogether."
