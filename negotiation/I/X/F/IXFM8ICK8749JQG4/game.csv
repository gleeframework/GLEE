"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a price closer to $1,050,000. This product has significant value to me, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to stay within budget. However, $1,050,000 doesn't quite cover the value and potential of this product. Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,100,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,075,000. I'm confident this price is fair for both of us and allows us to move forward with the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
