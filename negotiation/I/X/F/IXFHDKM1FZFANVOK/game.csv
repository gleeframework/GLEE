"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value you'll get from owning this product. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $700,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $550,000?",550000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $650,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While I agree the product is valuable, $650,000 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you be open to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $650,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'll offer it to you for $620,000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options.",620000.0,Alice,5,
