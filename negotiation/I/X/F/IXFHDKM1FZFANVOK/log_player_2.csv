"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $700,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value you'll get from owning this product. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $650,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $650,000, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'll offer it to you for $620,000. This is the final offer I'm willing to make. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $620,000.

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better price.  $620,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer."
