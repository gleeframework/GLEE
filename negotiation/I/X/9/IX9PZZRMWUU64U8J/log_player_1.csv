Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss something closer to $1000000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe the product has more value than that. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,000,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $1,250,000? This price acknowledges your needs while still allowing me to profit from the sale.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, could we aim for $1100000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 reflects the true value of the product. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more equitable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,150,000.  This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the product's value and my financial constraints, could we discuss $1125000 as a potential price?

I'll accept Bob's offer. Although I was hoping for a little higher, $1,125,000 is a good compromise and closer to my target than John's offer."
