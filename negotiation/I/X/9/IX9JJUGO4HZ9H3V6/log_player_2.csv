Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $65 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $75. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and I think you'll really enjoy it.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to settle yet. I can do $72 for the product, which is still a great deal considering its value to you. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is only $2 above your ideal price.  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a better result, and there's a risk Alice could increase the price again. Taking the $72 offer is a good compromise."
