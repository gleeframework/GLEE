"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned the product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understanding the value this product brings.  While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're getting closer. While $1,250,000 is still a bit under what I'd be comfortable with, I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to make this deal work.  Let me know if this works for you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice, and I'm glad we're getting close. However, I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really close to walking away and buying from John for $1,000,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
