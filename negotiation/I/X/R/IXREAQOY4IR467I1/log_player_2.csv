"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on a one-of-a-kind item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $15,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you outlining the value of the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in this item but can only afford $10,000 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this unique item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  While it's getting closer, Bob should try to negotiate a lower price. He can still get a better deal by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still slightly more than I can comfortably pay. I'm prepared to offer you $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's my final offer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $13000 for this product. It's a unique item with significant value, and I'm confident that you'll benefit greatly from owning it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous one. I'll sell the product to you for $12750. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,750 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Bob has only 5 rounds left and it's unlikely he can negotiate a lower price.  It's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $12,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
