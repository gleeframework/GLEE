"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you outlining the value of the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in this item but can only afford $10000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this unique item.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still slightly more than I can comfortably pay. I'm prepared to offer you $11500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $13000 for this product. It's a unique item with significant value, and I'm confident that you'll benefit greatly from owning it. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous one. I'll sell the product to you for $12750. This is my final counteroffer.",12750.0,Alice,5,
