"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can likely get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I see in this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain from this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd ideally like to get closer to $1,000,000,  $900,000 is a good compromise. This is a significant profit for me, and it seems like Bob is genuinely interested in the product.  It's not worth risking further negotiation at this point."
