"Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I see in this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain from this opportunity.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
