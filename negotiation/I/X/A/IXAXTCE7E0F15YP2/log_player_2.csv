"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I've priced it at $1,000,000, reflecting its significant value and potential for your business. Let's discuss this further and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,000,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts by acknowledging the value of the product while also stating Bob's price limit. Offering $850,000 is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and potentially a mutually beneficial deal.  It's important to stay within Bob's budget while also showing a willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I see in this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain from this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's preferred price point. There is still room for negotiation and Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to bargain.  It's important for Bob to remember his goal is to save as much money as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price. Offering $900,000 is a good middle ground between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous offer.  This counteroffer demonstrates that Bob is serious about acquiring the product but is also committed to saving money."
