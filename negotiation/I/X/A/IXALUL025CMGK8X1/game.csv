"Alice, your offer is significantly above my budget.  Given my research and what I'm willing to pay, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. I'm eager to work with you to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a significant gap from what I have in mind for this product's value.  I'm willing to move down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's potential.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still beyond my price point. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
