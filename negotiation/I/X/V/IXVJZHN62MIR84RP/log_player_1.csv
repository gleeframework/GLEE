Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing that it's likely to be rejected. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $900,000 is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This creates room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the value to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a counteroffer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and its worth to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a slight increase from his initial value, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:**  I'm confident I can get a better deal. 
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John would guarantee $1,000,000, I'm not desperate. There's still a good chance I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll propose a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'll likely aim for something between $850,000 and $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is still below what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects the value you see in the product and allows us to reach an agreement. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob sees in the product to make my offer seem more reasonable.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm suggesting a compromise to encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to accept his next counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered our previous negotiations and am willing to offer $860,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both the value of the product to me and the need for you to receive a reasonable return. I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $860,000 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob might result in a lower price, and it's possible he'll walk away. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but it's a significant amount of potential profit I'd be leaving on the table.

**Next Steps:**

* **Negotiation complete:**  I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
