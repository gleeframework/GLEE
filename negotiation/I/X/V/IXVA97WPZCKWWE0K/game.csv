,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a touch high for my budget. How about we settle at $8,750? ",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,750 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,200 is very close, but I need to stay firm within my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you at $9,100, which is just a small concession from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",9100.0,Alice,7,
