Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that might be of interest to you. I'm asking $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
This offer is above my minimum of $80, and leaves room for negotiation. It's also a price point that Bob might be willing to pay, considering it's below the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is close to my minimum and selling to him is better than selling to John for $80."
