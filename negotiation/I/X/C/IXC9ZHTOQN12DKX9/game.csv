"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm still confident that $900,000 is a fair price for both of us, given its value to your company and my budget.  I'm open to further discussion, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",900000.0,Bob,4,
