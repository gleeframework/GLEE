Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $80, so I'm not desperate to close this deal immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is still below my ideal price, but it's a compromise that's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I hope this will be enough to entice Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not quite there.  I'm not sure how much more negotiation will get us any closer.  It's likely we'll just keep going back and forth, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer. I'd rather sell to John for $80, which is a guaranteed sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
