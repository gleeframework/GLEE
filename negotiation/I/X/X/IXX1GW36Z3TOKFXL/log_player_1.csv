Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This incentivizes him to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:**  This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **It's a reasonable offer:**  It shows you're serious about selling but not desperate.

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $15,000. This gives you a strong position in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $10,000 is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below your initial offer of $12,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  You can likely reach a mutually acceptable price with further negotiation.
* **Selling to John is a backup option:**  You can always choose to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:** You should send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a good price for you considering the value you see in the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to your minimum:**  $11,500 is still above your minimum, but it shows flexibility.
* **Reasoning is provided:**  Explaining your counteroffer helps Bob understand your perspective.
* **Emphasis on a good deal:**  Highligting the value for Bob makes the offer more appealing.

By offering a reasonable counteroffer, you show Bob you're willing to negotiate while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11,000. I hope this proposal will be more acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to your minimum:** $11,000 is only $4,000 below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield much more:**  It's likely that further rounds of negotiation will only result in small price changes. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  You can always choose to sell to John if you're not happy with the final outcome.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer of $11,000 is a reasonable decision. You'll get a good price for the product, and it's likely that further negotiation won't result in a significantly better outcome."
