{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 if Bob declines.

By offering the product at $9,500, we're aiming for a price that's:

* **Significantly higher than Bob's valuation:** This maximizes potential profit.
* **Slightly below our guaranteed sale price:** This gives Bob an incentive to act quickly and potentially secure what he might perceive as a ""deal"" compared to us selling it to John."
