"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $15000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to $12000? I believe this would be more in line with what I can afford while still allowing me to benefit from the product's features.",12000.0,Bob,2,
