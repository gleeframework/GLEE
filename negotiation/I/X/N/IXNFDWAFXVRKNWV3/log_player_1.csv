Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** Offering it at $145 is a reasonable markup from Bob's perceived value ($120) and gives you a chance to earn more than your minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $145, there might be a slight possibility of negotiation with Bob if he's interested but finds the price a tad high."
