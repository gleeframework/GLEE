Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $500,000 is quite a bit below what I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to consider your product, but I need to see a price closer to its true value.  Let's start with $700,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $650,000 is still a bit lower than where I can comfortably go.  I'm confident that we can find a solution that benefits both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000? This price acknowledges the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable margin for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway again. However, $675,000 still doesn't quite reflect the value I'm seeing in this product.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000 to make this happen. This would be a good deal for both of us and avoid any further back-and-forth.
