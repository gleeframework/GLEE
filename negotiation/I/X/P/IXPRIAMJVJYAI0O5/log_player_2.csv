"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  Bob knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $9,000 is better than John's price, there's still room to negotiate. It's likely Alice will be willing to come down a bit more to secure the deal with Bob."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,900. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has successfully negotiated the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer of $9,500. At $8,900, the price is within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John. There's a chance Bob could continue negotiating, but the risk is that Alice might walk away, leaving Bob with only the option of buying from John at a higher price.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and secure the product at a favorable price."
