"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,500 is a fair price, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial offer.  Would you consider $10,500? This feels like a good compromise that reflects the true value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you consider $10,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a commitment to purchase it if we can agree on this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
