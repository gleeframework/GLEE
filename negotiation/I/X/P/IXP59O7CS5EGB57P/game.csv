"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to acquire this unique product. It's a game-changer in its industry, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1200000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it.  This is a fair price considering my  maximum budget and the potential value of the product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is your maximum budget, but I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's potential and the value it can bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go. Considering my budget and the price John is offering, I'm willing to pay $950000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a balance between your budget and the product's value, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $980000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's potential.",980000.0,Alice,5,
