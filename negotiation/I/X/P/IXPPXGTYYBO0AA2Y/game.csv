"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I acknowledge your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's value.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,600,000. This reflects a reasonable price point for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could meet you halfway at $1,400,000.  Would that work for you?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,400,000 is still below the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value and potential of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
