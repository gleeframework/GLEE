"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price for a valuable asset like this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring if we can bridge the gap, but it's not there yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Let's try $1,050,000. It's a good compromise, and it gives us both a chance to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my maximum budget, but I still think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $975,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm also aware of John's offer, which is a safe and guaranteed option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're close to your budget, but I'm still a bit higher. Let's compromise at $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. It's a good middle ground that's worth considering."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back and forth, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'd be willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

While I'm not entirely happy with the price, Bob seems unwilling to meet my minimum. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price and avoids further negotiation."
