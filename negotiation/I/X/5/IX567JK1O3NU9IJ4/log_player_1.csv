Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,500, but I'm still hoping we can get closer to my target price. Can we try $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  Bob is holding firm at his maximum value for the product ($15,000).  It's unlikely he'll go any higher. Since you have a guaranteed offer from John at $15,000, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Bob. You'd be risking losing a sure thing for a potentially worse deal."
