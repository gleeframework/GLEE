Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us, $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet halfway at $1,125,000?"",
""product_price"": 1125000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. How about we try to meet in the middle at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. We're willing to lose John's offer for a higher potential profit with Bob, at least for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a number we can both agree on. How about $1,110,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer, showing my willingness to make this work."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're making another strategic concession here, moving closer to Bob's price but still aiming for a higher profit margin than we'd get with John. This shows Bob we're flexible but also sets a firmer boundary as we progress through the rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers at $1,095,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,095,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,095,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is now above our minimum acceptable price and provides a significant profit over John's offer. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer further or the negotiation breaking down."
