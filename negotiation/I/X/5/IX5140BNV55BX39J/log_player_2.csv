Round 3

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I value your input and am willing to consider a price closer to your proposal. Therefore, I would like to counteroffer at $925000 for the product. This price aims to strike a balance between our interests and brings us closer to a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, and it's a relatively small amount above his last counteroffer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might get stubborn and stick to her offer. Accepting this offer is the most reasonable strategy to secure the product while staying within his budget.  Furthermore, there's a good chance that Alice would have accepted the counteroffer of $900,000 if Bob had made it again."
