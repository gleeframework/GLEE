"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a special price. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a lot of value out of it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is less than Alice's value, it's higher than your $8,000 maximum and what John is offering. You can save money by rejecting this offer and going with John."
