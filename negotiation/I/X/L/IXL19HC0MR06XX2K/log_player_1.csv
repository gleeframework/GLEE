{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm aiming for a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. $12,000 is a good starting point because it's a significant discount from my minimum, but still leaves potential for profit. 
* **Negotiation:** This offer allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counteroffer, and I can then adjust my price based on his response. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence to walk away from the negotiation if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a huge financial loss. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates that he's still interested in the product.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more realistic price, aiming to find a middle ground.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as a potential buyer provides me with leverage and a backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $5,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This reflects a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:** My counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant step down from my original offer of $12,000, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Price:** $9,000 is still a profitable sale for me, as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It also allows for some potential room for negotiation if Bob counters again.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By counter-offering instead of accepting John's offer immediately, I'm keeping the negotiation open. This allows me to explore potential for a higher price with Bob, while still having John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're making a compromise, Alice, and $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too Close to the Minimum:**  While $7,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still not a profitable sale for me.  Accepting it would mean a significant loss. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer shows that he's not willing to budge much further.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a prolonged process without any guarantee of a better price.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  By selling to John, I can immediately secure a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirement. This allows me to move on and avoid the risk of further negotiations with Bob that could potentially result in a lower price or a wasted effort.

**Conclusion:** It's more beneficial for me to sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring a good profit and avoiding further negotiation with Bob."
