"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is significantly below what I need to sell, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.  Let's make this happen!",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,250,000, which would be $1,075,000. How about we try $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're committed to getting a good deal, and I respect that.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $1,062,500.  It's a compromise that's closer to your offer, but still ensures I get a fair price for the product. What do you say?  Let's wrap this up!",1062500.0,Alice,5,
