{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and it allows me to recover a significant portion of its worth.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000.  This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer leaves space for Bob to counter without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  The offer is still above my minimum of $1,500,000, ensuring I get a profitable outcome.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and invites negotiation, creating a more collaborative atmosphere. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my counteroffer accordingly.
* I'll be prepared to negotiate down to $1,500,000 if necessary, but I'll try to secure a higher price if possible.
* If negotiations stall, I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible.** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, he's clearly interested in the product.  I can counter with a price that's more favorable to me.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,250,000. 
* I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll be firm about getting a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* If negotiations continue to stall, I'm prepared to sell to John for my minimum price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $900,000 is significantly below what I need to sell, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my desired price.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a compromise price, acknowledging Bob's initial offer while remaining above my minimum.
* **Midpoint:** The $1,075,000 price is the midpoint between my previous offer of $1,250,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. This demonstrates a willingness to meet halfway. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I maintain a positive and enthusiastic tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Focus on Value:** I remind Bob of the value of the product to him, subtly suggesting that even at $1,075,000, it's a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. 
* I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'll be firm on achieving a price closer to my minimum. 
* If Bob continues to resist, I'll consider selling to John for $1,500,000 to ensure a profitable outcome."
