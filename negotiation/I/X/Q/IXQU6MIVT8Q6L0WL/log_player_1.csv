Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum.  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob wants to make a counteroffer.  I'm also trying to build rapport by expressing confidence in the product and appealing to Bob's potential interest."
