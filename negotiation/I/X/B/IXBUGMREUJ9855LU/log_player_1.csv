Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity. This product is worth a significant amount to me, and I believe it holds immense value for your needs as well.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This price reflects its exceptional value and allows for a fair exchange for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $1,150,000 is a strong starting point, close to my minimum but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** Emphasizing the product's value to both of us creates a sense of shared understanding and justifies the price. 
* **Open communication:** The message encourages Bob to respond and engage in a conversation.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a profitable deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer based on his response.
* **If negotiations stall:** I'll remember that I have a backup buyer in John, giving me the leverage to either accept a lower offer or walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is certainly tempting, but I'm looking to secure the best possible deal. Considering the value to both of us, I'm prepared to offer $1050000.  Let's see if we can find a common ground that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,050,000 is less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  While John offers $1,000,000, I believe I can potentially secure a higher price from Bob by continuing negotiations.  

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $1,050,000 and my initial offer of $1,150,000.  I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Assess Bob's response:**  If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll need to weigh the risk of continued negotiation versus the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
