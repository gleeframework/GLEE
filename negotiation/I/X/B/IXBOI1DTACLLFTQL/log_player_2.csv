"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice:**  You pay $14,000, which is within your budget of $15,000 and saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** This forces you to buy from John at a higher price ($15,000), which isn't the best financial choice."
