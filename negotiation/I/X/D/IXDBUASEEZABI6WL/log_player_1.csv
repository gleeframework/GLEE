Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves some profit margin if Bob accepts.  It's also important to note that John is a backup buyer who is willing to pay my minimum, giving me confidence in my position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's below my minimum acceptable value, and I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay significantly more.  I will reject this offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}

This counteroffer is a significant step down from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still giving me a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my acceptable value. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject this offer and make another counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my offer again, but still holding firm at a price above my minimum acceptable value.  This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while ensuring I still receive a reasonable profit."
