"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $150 to me, and Bob's offer of $120 is too low. I'll try to get a better price from Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $160?  I'm willing to be flexible to make this work."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not convinced that I can't get a better price from Bob. I'll try to get him to go a bit higher before settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $140 is still a bit too low for me. To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $145? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum price of $150.  While there are a few rounds left, I'm not sure I can convince Bob to go higher. To avoid risking further negotiation and a possible lower price, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
