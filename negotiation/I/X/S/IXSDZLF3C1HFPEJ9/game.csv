"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider selling the product for $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your desire to keep expenses low, but $850,000 is simply too far below the product's value for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair return. I'm prepared to sell for $900,000. This price still leaves significant room for you to profit, while ensuring a good deal for me. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I've considered your latest offer, Alice. While I respect your position, I believe we can find a middle ground. Could you possibly lower the price to $875,000? This would still provide a reasonable profit for you while keeping the cost down for me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $875,000 is closer, but I'm still not comfortable with that price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $887,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's reach an agreement.",887500.0,Alice,5,
