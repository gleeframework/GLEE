"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $110. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about $105? I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $108. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
