"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $20000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10000 for this product, but I'm not sure it's worth more than that to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $17000, but I think the product is worth more than that to you. Can you meet me in the middle?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try to find some common ground. I'm prepared to offer $12000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll need to look at other options.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is your maximum, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to come down to $16000, which is a $1000 reduction from my previous offer. Can you meet me at this price?",16000.0,Alice,5,
