{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you could be even greater.  I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, reflecting its unique capabilities. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $800000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth at least $1,000,000 to Alice, and John is offering that price.  It's better to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get closer to my own valuation for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price still reflects the significant value this product brings, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's continue the conversation."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950000 is still a bit outside my range.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer $850000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice still wants to aim for a higher price. Even though John is offering $1,000,000, it's worth seeing if a slightly better deal can be struck with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to drop to $900,000. This price is closer to your budget, while still acknowledging the unique value this product offers.  Let's aim for a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up to $875000.  This is a significant investment for me, but I believe the product's value justifies it.  Let's work together to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still aiming for a price closer to $900,000. Even though Bob's offer is getting closer, there's still room to negotiate.  There are four rounds remaining, and it's worth trying to get a slightly higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're both determined to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to come down to $890,000.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I understand the product's value, my budget is tight.  I'm willing to offer $860000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.  Let's finalize this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, the risk of failing to reach a deal with Bob is high.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,000,000, which is a much safer and more profitable option.  It's time to sell to John and secure a solid outcome."
