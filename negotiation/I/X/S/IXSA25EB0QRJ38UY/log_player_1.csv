Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, you want to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Perceived Value:** By starting at $15,000, you anchor a high price in Bob's mind, emphasizing the product's value.  
* **Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept your offer. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  While you aim high, the $15,000 starting point allows room for negotiation if Bob counters. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while acknowledging you have a guaranteed backup option."
