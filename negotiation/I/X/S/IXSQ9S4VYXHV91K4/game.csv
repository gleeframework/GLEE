"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for a final compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us and ensures we can finalize this deal. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
