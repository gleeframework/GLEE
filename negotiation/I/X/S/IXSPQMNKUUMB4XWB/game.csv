"Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is a fair compromise considering its value to you. I'm open to discussing it further if you're still interested.",15500.0,Alice,5,
