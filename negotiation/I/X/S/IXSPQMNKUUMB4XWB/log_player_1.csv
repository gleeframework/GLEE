"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for something worth so much to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept right away.  This allows me to gauge his interest and see how much he's willing to negotiate. It's important to build a relationship while staying firm on my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with it. I'll reject his offer and try to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,500, which is a fair compromise considering its value to you. I'm open to discussing it further if you're still interested."", ""product_price"": 15500}
