"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. This is a price that allows both of us to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

This is a great deal!  Bob's offer of $10,000 matches the value of the product to him and is my minimum acceptable price. I'm happy to accept and close the deal."
