"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $12000. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it's a great deal for you too, considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  While the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, he's aiming to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $9000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm offering it to you for $10500. This is a price that allows both of us to be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $10,500 is still above Bob's target of saving as much as possible. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  Additionally, buying from John for $10,000 is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
