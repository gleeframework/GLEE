"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $1,300,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000. This would allow us both to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know if this works for you.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
