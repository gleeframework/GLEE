This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll make a smart investment with this purchase.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John at a lower price."
