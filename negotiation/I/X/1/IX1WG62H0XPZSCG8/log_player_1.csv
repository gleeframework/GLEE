Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me somewhere in the middle. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $12,000?

Bob's offer:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000. Accepting his $13,000 offer means losing out on $2,000 that John is guaranteed to pay.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
