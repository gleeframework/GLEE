Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $975,000 is a significant concession, but I'm still not willing to go that low.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the final price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $1,025,000 and has stated this is her final offer.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely she'll go much lower. Accepting this offer secures a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,500,000."
