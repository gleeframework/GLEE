"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer $1,800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,800,000 is still significantly below my initial assessment of the product's value.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This reflects the product's unique capabilities and the potential return on investment it offers. ",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. Considering your initial offer was $2,250,000 and you're now at $2,100,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $2,025,000. This is my best and final offer. What do you think?",2025000.0,Bob,4,
