"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,000,000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'll counter with $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers? I'd be willing to go up to $1,125,000.",1125000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is closer to your last offer. This price reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable profit for me. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
