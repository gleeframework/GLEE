Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,000,000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'll counter with $1,250,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us.  What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,200,000, which is closer to your last offer. This price reflects the value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable profit for me. Let's see if we can find common ground here.
