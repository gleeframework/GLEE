I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $80 but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum price of $80. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

I'm counter-offering at $85. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer."
