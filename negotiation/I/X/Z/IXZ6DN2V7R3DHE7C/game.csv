"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $13000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to meet me at $11000?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price reflects its value.",11000.0,Bob,4,
