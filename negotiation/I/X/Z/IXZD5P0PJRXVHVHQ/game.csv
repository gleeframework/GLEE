"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,025,000?  This gives you a good deal and allows me to earn a reasonable profit.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle.  While $1,025,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $1,000,000. That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
