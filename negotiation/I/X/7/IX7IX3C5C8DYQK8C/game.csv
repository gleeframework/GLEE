"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand you're looking for a lower price,  $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $105?",105.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I hear you. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $107.50.  This is a fair price that's closer to both of our desired numbers.  What do you think?",107.5,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than $105. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider buying from someone else. Can you meet me at $105?",105.0,Bob,6,
