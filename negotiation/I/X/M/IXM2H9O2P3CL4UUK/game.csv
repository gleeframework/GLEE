"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know its value to you is even higher. Let's make this happen!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is definitely worth the price you're asking, but I'm not quite ready to go that high. Let's start with $1,200,000 and see if we can find some common ground. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  I'm confident we can close this deal quickly and amicably.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  While $1,300,000 is getting closer, I'm still a bit stretched at that price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  I'm confident we can finalize this quickly if we agree.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is still a bit below what I need.  Let's meet in the middle again at $1,275,000. I'm confident that this price is fair, and we can finalize this deal quickly and amicably.  Let's close this deal and move on.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
