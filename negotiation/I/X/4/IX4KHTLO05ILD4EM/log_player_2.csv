# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product. I believe it's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for the same price.  This is a great deal for both of us, as I know you'll find significant value in it. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
