Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, and it's a bit closer to my original price. Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your original offer of $8,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  I'm better off buying the product from John for $8,000, even though it means missing out on potentially negotiating a slightly better price with Alice."
