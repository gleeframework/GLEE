# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her previous offer, it's still higher than what he can get from John. There's room to negotiate further with Alice, aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $9,200. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from it.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's offer is still higher than his target, and continuing to negotiate might drag on and risk losing John as an option. It's best to take the guaranteed lower price from John at this point."
