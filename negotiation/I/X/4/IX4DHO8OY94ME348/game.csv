"Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8000, which is the minimum value I'm willing to accept for the product. I'm willing to make a small compromise, though. I'll sell the product to you for $8100. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",8100.0,Alice,5,
