Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to start the price at $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $14,000?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I could potentially go up to $7,000, but that's the absolute most I'm willing to spend. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to drop to $12,000, which is the very lowest I can go for this product.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, and I respect that. However, $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This offer stands for the next two rounds. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has indicated that $9,000 is his upper limit, and even that offer stands for two rounds.  It's unlikely further negotiation will get you closer to your $12,000 minimum. Accepting John's offer ensures you get your desired price without further risk or time spent haggling."
