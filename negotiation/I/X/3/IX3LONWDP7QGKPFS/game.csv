"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I could potentially go up to $7,000, but that's the absolute most I'm willing to spend.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're still quite far apart. I'm willing to drop to $12,000, which is the very lowest I can go for this product.  This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, and I respect that. However, $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $9,000.  This offer stands for the next two rounds. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Bob,6,
