"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. My starting price is $1,450,000.  Let me know your thoughts!",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to meet at $1,175,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but  $1,175,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
