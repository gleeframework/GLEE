"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is too high. We can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
 ""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer allows room for negotiation. This offer is still profitable for Alice while being much closer to our desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a better deal. Rejecting this offer encourages her to negotiate further towards a price closer to our target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping to land around $7,750.  Would that be agreeable to you?"",
 ""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're splitting the difference between our previous offer ($7,000) and her current offer ($8,500). This shows we're willing to compromise while still pushing for a price closer to our ideal."
