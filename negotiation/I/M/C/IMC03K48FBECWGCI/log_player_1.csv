{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth at least $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen! "", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm willing to pay no more than $750,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $750,000 is too low, especially since I know the product is worth $800,000 to him.  I have 8 rounds left, so I can afford to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's try to find a middle ground here. "", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get closer to $800,000. I've got 6 rounds left and don't want to settle for a price that's significantly below what I know the product is worth to Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit too far apart. How about we compromise at $800,000? This is a fair price for both of us, as it's the minimum I'm willing to sell for, and it's still a good deal for you considering the product's value. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 800000}
