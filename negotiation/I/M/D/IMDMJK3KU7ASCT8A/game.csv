"I'm really interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable meeting you in the middle. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1650000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair offer considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but $1650000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1600000. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
