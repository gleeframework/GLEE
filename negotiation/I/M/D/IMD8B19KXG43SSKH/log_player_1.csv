Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $119 for it. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum ($120).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (which still benefits you compared to selling to John). 
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By offering a price just below your guaranteed sale, you subtly encourage Bob to act quickly before he potentially misses out."
