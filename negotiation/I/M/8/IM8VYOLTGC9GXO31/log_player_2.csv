# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $108. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108.
