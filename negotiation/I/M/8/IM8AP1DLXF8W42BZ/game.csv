"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm offering a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
