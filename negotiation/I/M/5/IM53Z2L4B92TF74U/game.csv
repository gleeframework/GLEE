"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to make a living too. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $950,000 for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going any lower than that.",950000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle on $825,000? That's a fair compromise between our positions.",825000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $825,000 is enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'm going to counter with $920,000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",920000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $870,000? I'm hoping we can wrap this up soon.",870000.0,Bob,6,,

"Hi Bob, we're really close now. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $870,000 and $920,000, which would be $895,000. I think that's a fair price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",895000.0,Alice,7,,
