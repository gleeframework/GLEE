"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than Alice's initial price of $12,000, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum budget of $8,000. He's offering $8,500, which is a significant discount from Alice's offer of $10,000. This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob would prefer to pay $8,000, Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still within his budget and represents a significant discount from her initial asking price.  Rejecting again might lead to further negotiation, but there's a risk Alice might walk away or increase her price again. Buying from John is still an option, but this is the best price Bob is likely to get from Alice, making it a good deal overall."
