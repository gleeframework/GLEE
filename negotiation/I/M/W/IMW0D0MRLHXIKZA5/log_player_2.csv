"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always better to try to negotiate and see if Alice is willing to go lower than $10,000. There's no downside to rejecting the initial offer and exploring the possibility of a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer that is 20% lower than Alice's initial price is a good starting point. This shows that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to make a significant offer, but it also leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved down in price, but it's still worth pushing for a lower price. Bob can likely get the product for less than $9,000, and there are still several rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. This counteroffer is still significantly lower than Alice's current price, but it shows Bob is serious about buying the product while also trying to get the best possible price."
