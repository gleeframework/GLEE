"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 10000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. This is a bold move, but it establishes my starting point and allows room for negotiation. If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to negotiate down from this price.  If he rejects, I'll adjust accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer just yet. He knows my minimum, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product and believe it's worth more.  Hopefully, Bob sees this as a reasonable middle ground and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is a decent compromise. It's above my minimum of $8,000 and gets me closer to my desired price. I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds, so it's best to accept and secure the sale."
