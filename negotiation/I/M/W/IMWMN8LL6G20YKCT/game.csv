"Bob, I'm delighted to offer you this incredible product. I know it's worth a great deal to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,750,000.  Let's see if we can make this work!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to  $1,100,000.  Would that work for you?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $1,600,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something more affordable. How about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1,300,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close!  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,375,000?",1375000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  $1,375,000 is getting closer, but it's still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000.  I feel like this price is fair,  reflecting the value of the product and  leaving room for both of us to be happy with the outcome.  What do you think?",1425000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,400,000. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my limit.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
