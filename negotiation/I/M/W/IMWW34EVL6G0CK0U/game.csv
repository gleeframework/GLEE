"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  $1,050,000 is my absolute minimum.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000, which is $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
