Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to make more than $1,000,000, and this offer achieves that.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving you with a profitable sale.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** This sets the tone for a professional and efficient negotiation.

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate a higher price.  Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price. While you could accept and get $950,000, that's still lower than your guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to counter with a price closer to your desired range, or to sell to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  $1,050,000 is my absolute minimum.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a price closer to your desired range:**  This counteroffer is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000,  demonstrating your willingness to compromise while still ensuring a good return.
* **Highlight the value for Bob:** Remind Bob that the product is worth $1,200,000 to him, making the offer still a good deal. 
* **Keep the door open for negotiation:** By stating your ""absolute minimum,"" you allow for further discussion without completely closing the door."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000, which is $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally reached your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  This is a good outcome because you are achieving your goal of earning at least $1,000,000, and you have also avoided the hassle of further negotiation.  While there's always the possibility of potentially getting a higher price, the risk of further negotiations dragging on or leading to a deadlock is not worth it."
