"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the market value of the product. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is the lowest I can go without compromising my business's bottom line.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns about making a profit, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1350000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1300000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1380000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",1380000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1420000. This is the best I can do without losing too much profit. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1420000.0,Alice,7,
