"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth a lot more. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is my best offer, let me know if it works for you.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,250? This still gives you a good deal and leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let me know what you think!",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $10,750, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
