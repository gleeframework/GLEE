"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $65?",65.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, $65 is a bit too low for me. I understand you want a good deal, but I need to make a reasonable profit. How about we split the difference at $72.50? That's still a great price for you, and I can make a decent profit.",72.5,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  How about we settle at $70 even? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",70.0,Bob,4,
