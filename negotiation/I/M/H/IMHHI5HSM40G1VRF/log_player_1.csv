"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $115 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is better than Bob's initial valuation of $100, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I have 8 rounds left, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more flexibility."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to pay $108 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved a bit closer to my desired price, $108 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I have 6 rounds left, and I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to take a risk and keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate that. However, I can't go lower than $112. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 112} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $112 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to pay $106 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $106. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $106
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 4 rounds left, Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I've tried to negotiate, but it seems like we're at an impasse.  It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $120, which is my minimum price. I can't risk further negotiation with Bob, as he's unwilling to budge significantly, and I'm already close to my deadline."
