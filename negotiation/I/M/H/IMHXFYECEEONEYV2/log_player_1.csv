{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. I believe it's a fantastic value considering its potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than your minimum, leaving room for negotiation. The message also tries to establish a reason for the price, framing it as a good value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try and get a price closer to your initial $18,000 asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 doesn't quite cover the value I'm placing on the product. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This allows for a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $13500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value I'm getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is closer to my initial asking price of $18,000 and is still significantly higher than the guaranteed $12,000 from John.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the best option in this situation."
