"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, and I'm willing to make a slight concession. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $1250000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential return on investment it can bring to your business. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
