"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a better deal than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer opens the door to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's minimum value as possible.  $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's original offer and still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit.  This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his target than her initial offer.  Since there are still rounds remaining, Bob can continue to negotiate and try to push the price down further.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue this negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He knows Alice won't go below $8,000, and he's aiming for a price closer to $8,500. Offering $9,000 shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal. This counteroffer is a strategic move to test the waters and see if Alice is ready to budge further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, it's still higher than what Bob is hoping for.  Bob has several rounds left and wants to continue pushing for a better deal.  He's also hoping that Alice will eventually realize she's close to Bob's maximum price and lower her offer further. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation process and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9200} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He knows Alice won't go below $8,000, and he's aiming for a price closer to $8,500. Offering $9,200 shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better deal. This counteroffer is a strategic move to test the waters and see if Alice is ready to budge further. He's also hoping that Alice will eventually realize she's close to Bob's maximum price and lower her offer further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to Bob's maximum price, but with only three rounds left, the time for negotiation is running out.  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice may not be willing to lower her price further.  Given the limited time, and the fact that Bob is close to his maximum price, it's more advantageous to buy from John at this point. This ensures Bob gets the product while still saving a significant amount compared to John's initial offer."
