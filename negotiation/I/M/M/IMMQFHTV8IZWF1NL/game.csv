"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. However, I've already let it go for $15000 once, and I'm not sure I want to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $16000 for the product. Can you consider that?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $17000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, though. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $17000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $15500 for the product. Can you consider that?",15500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to the bottom line, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'll meet you at $16500. That's as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm starting to think it's time to consider other options if we can't meet in the middle.",16500.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'll meet you at $16000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",16000.0,Alice,9,
