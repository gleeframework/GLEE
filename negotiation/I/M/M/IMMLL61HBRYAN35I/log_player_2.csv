Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $125 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130?  I think that's fair considering the value of the product to you.

Alice has come down to $130, which is still a good deal for me. I can save $20 compared to buying from John."
