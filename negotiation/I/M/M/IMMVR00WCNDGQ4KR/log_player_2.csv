Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $775,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $825,000. This is my last offer before I consider other options.

It's time to switch to John.  Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000, and you have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000.  There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice when you can save $25,000 by going with John."
