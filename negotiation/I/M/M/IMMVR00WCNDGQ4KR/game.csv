"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for starting the discussion. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a little too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $850,000. This is my final offer on the higher end of the spectrum. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we both want to make a deal here.  $850,000 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $775,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $825,000. This is my last offer before I consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,7,
