"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  You can likely get a better price than $900,000.  Buying from John is always an option, but it's best to see if you can get a lower price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price well below my maximum. Alice is likely to reject this, but it sets a strong starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering my maximum price.  This should be a good compromise for Alice, as it's still above what she'd get from John.  If she rejects this, I'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to my limit, but I'm not willing to go higher. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John and secure the product for my desired price.  Further negotiation with Alice might lead to a lower price, but it's not guaranteed, and I'm risking running out of rounds."
