# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize the value this product holds for you, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,800,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget. While it's closer to his target, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue bargaining and hopefully secure a lower price."
