Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a bit above my minimum value of $80, giving me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to counter if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is close to my minimum acceptable price and leaves me with a decent profit. Accepting his offer is the best option in this situation."
