Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a strong initial offer is key. Since Bob values the product at $100, offering it at $95 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price close to his maximum valuation. This strategy maximizes potential profit while acknowledging Bob's potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer of $85 is closer to his valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open, and I can try to steer him closer to a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've come down from $95 to $90, signaling a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Middle Ground:**  This price point aims for a compromise, splitting the difference between his offer ($85) and my previous ask ($95).
* **Still Profitable:**  $90 remains above my minimum acceptable price of $80, ensuring a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:** $87.50 is still a profitable price, exceeding my minimum of $80.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains, while risking Bob walking away. 
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal now means I secure the sale and avoid potentially lengthy negotiations."
