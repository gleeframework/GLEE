Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial. It's a steal at $1,200,000.  I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer and we can make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a significant discount for Bob:**  $1,200,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as he values the product at $1,500,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, which is likely.
* **It provides a good buffer against John's offer:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, you still have a backup buyer in John who will pay $1,000,000. 

This approach is strategic, aiming to maximize your profit while keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to John's offer, there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price.  Here's why rejecting the offer is the best move:

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so there's still a significant gap between his current offer and his perceived value.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting the offer shows Bob you're not desperate for a quick sale and that you're willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This gives you more leverage in future negotiations.
* **Gaining Information:** By rejecting the offer, you can learn more about Bob's willingness to pay and adjust your counteroffer accordingly.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you should counteroffer with a price higher than Bob's offer, but lower than your initial offer. This will show Bob you're willing to negotiate while maintaining your desired profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a strategic compromise:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:** It shows you're willing to negotiate, but not at a major discount.
* **Lower than your initial offer:** It demonstrates flexibility while still maintaining a substantial profit.
* **Reasonable compromise:** It aims to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both parties.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while still keeping the potential for a higher profit."
