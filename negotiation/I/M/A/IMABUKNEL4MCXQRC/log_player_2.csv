"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a price that's sure to be mutually beneficial. It's a steal at $1,200,000.  I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer and we can make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's better to reject and counter-offer to try and get a better price.  Bob can still buy from John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's within his budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $1,500,000. There's a good chance Bob can still negotiate a lower price in future rounds, but the risk of losing the deal entirely is greater. It's a calculated risk to accept the offer and secure the product."
