You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $120 to Alice, so I'm sure she's making a profit even at $95. I'd rather wait and buy it from John for $80.
