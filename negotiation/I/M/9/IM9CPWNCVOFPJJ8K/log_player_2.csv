"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your budget of $8,000. There's room for negotiation, and you have 10 rounds to try and get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $12,000, but it's still within a reasonable range given that the product is worth $15,000 to Alice.  This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm also trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating.  I believe I can get a lower price, especially since Alice already rejected my counteroffer, indicating a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $9,500. This shows that I'm willing to meet Alice halfway but still want to stay under my $8,000 limit.  Since Alice rejected my previous offer, I believe a slight increase could be enough to entice her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $10,500, it's still above my budget. I'm going to reject this offer and continue negotiating. I believe that I can still get a better price, especially since Alice has already rejected two of my counteroffers. I'm confident that I can reach a deal that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $9,800. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but it's still below Alice's latest offer of $10,500. I'm hoping that this will show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product and that I'm willing to meet her halfway. I'm confident that I can get a deal done within my budget, as we are getting close to my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $10,200, it's still above my budget.  I've already made several counteroffers, and Alice has rejected all of them. It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement.  Rather than continue to risk further negotiation, I'm going to buy the product from John for $8,000.  This guarantees that I get the product within my budget and avoids any further potential delays or disagreements with Alice."
