"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $2000000 for the product. I'm looking to make a more reasonable investment. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1400000 is simply too low for me to consider at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This price still represents a substantial value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1400000 again. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm looking for. Can you consider this revised offer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
