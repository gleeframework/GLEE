"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value of the product to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, and $850000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1000000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000, but I need to stay within my budget. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
