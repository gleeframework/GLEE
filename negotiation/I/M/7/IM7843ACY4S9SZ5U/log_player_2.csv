# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I need to make a profit on this sale, and $850000 is still a bit low for me.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has stated this is her final offer, and $1,050,000 is still outside of Bob's budget. It's better to secure the product from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
