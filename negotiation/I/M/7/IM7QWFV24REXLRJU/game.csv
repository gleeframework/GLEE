"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8250. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirement.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that price?",7800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $7800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirement.",8100.0,Alice,5,
