"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This aligns with its true value to me and allows for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $1,000,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its true value to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your flexibility, $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm confident we can find common ground.  I'm willing to offer $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a significant profit for you.  Let's make this deal happen.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
