"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm interested, but  $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $1,050,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more in the $950,000 range.  Would that be feasible for you?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your request, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,025,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
