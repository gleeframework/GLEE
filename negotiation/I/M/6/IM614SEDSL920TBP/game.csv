"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering both our needs. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000. However, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,075,000 is still a bit below what I need to accept.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,087,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product for both of us.  What do you think?",1087500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,087,500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay. I'm happy to go up to $1,080,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value we each place on the product. Let's close this deal.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
