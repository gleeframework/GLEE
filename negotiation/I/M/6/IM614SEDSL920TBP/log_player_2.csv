Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a good deal compared to the product's value to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering both our needs. What do you say?
