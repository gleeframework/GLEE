"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, but she's offering it to you for $900,000.  This means there's still room for negotiation. Since you have a better alternative with John, you should try to get a lower price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your budget. I believe this price will benefit both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's new offer of $875,000 is closer to your budget, but you can still potentially get a better deal. Since you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $825,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns and appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, it's not worth continuing to negotiate. Alice has come down to $850,000, which is only $50,000 more than what John is offering. Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal with Alice altogether, especially since she's indicated that she's not willing to go lower.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product and only pay $50,000 more than your best alternative."
