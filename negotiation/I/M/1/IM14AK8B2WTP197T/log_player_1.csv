"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in great condition and worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a backup option with John.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $8,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's still a great price for a product worth $10,000 to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with his offer. I have the option of selling to John for $8,000, which is only $200 less than Bob's current offer.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to see eye-to-eye on this price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,600. That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8600} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,300. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now only $300 more than what John is offering.  At this point, I'm getting close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price.  It's safer to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John."
