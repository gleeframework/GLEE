"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value and my minimum acceptable price. To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and considerable potential for your business.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but we're still quite far apart on price.  To be frank, anything above $1,000,000 is pushing my budget.  I could go up to $950,000 if that gets us closer to a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer a significant price reduction to $1,400,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal. I believe this price point offers significant value for a product of this caliber and potential.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated, but $1,400,000 is still beyond what I'm comfortable spending.  My absolute maximum is $1,000,000 for this product. If you can meet that price, we have a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
