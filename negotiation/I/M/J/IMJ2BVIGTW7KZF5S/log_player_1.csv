Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,500,000** is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* This offer allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal if he accepts. 
* It also allows for me to maximize potential profit.

**Strategy:**

By offering a higher price, I am aiming to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** If he's truly interested in the product and sees its value, he might be willing to pay a premium.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob finds the price too high, we can negotiate downwards, potentially still securing a price above my minimum.
* **Maximize my profit:** Even if Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed buyer in John, ensuring a good return on my investment."
