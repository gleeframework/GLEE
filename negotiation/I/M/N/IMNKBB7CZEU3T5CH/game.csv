"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate that.  Let's split the difference this time. How about $812,500?  That's a fair middle ground that should allow us to finally close this deal.",812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $812,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $790,000 for the product, which I think is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but  $790,000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's try $800,000 -  that's a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it's also the price John is offering.  This would be a win-win for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly.",800000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure why you're bringing up John's price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to pay $795,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can still come to an agreement.",795000.0,Bob,8,
