Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is your absolute best, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more offer: $14,000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings.

Alice is unlikely to come down further and getting a price below $14,000 seems unlikely.  It's time to cut bait and go with the guaranteed good deal from John."
