"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still a ways off from that number.  Would you be willing to do $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,500. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for working with me. $14,500 is closer but still a bit rich for me. My absolute best is $13,000. If that doesn't work, I think I'll have to pass this time. ",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is your absolute best, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more offer: $14,000. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings.",14000.0,Alice,7,
