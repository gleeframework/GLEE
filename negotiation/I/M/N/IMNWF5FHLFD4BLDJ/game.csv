"I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8,500 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This price still allows me to make a profit, and I'm confident the product will be worth it to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $8,500, so I'm offering $8,750. Can we meet at this price?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  Let's split the difference one last time.  I'm willing to go down to $8,875.  This is my final offer.  I believe the value of the product will far outweigh the price.  What do you say?",8875.0,Alice,5,
