""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as much as possible from Bob while ensuring he's likely to accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so any offer below that will be instantly accepted. However, you want to maximize your gain.
* **Your Safety Net:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a significant profit margin for you ($150,000) while still offering Bob a $150,000 discount from his perceived value. This makes it more likely for him to accept than a higher offer closer to your minimum."
