"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1,500,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, there's still room for negotiation. We'll aim higher in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm confident in the product's value at $1,400,000, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This offer represents a significant saving for you while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering the current market conditions and my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on a price closer to $1,275,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

We're getting closer, but we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. It's worth pushing a little further in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,300,000.  This price reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your investment considerations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest proposal. I've given this some thought, and I'd like to propose a price of $1,285,000. This seems to be a reasonable compromise considering both the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,285,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,285,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  

We've negotiated well, and while we're not getting the absolute maximum profit, securing $1,285,000 is a very strong outcome.  Further negotiation might only yield small incremental gains and risks losing Bob altogether."
