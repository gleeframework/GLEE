Alice's offer is way too high.  It's worth starting negotiations to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160.

Alice's offer is still too high. I can get the product from John for $100, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $160 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $140, Bob, but I'm not sure I can meet you there. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make a profit. How about $155? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. It's better to buy from John at this point since he's offering a lower price and I'm confident I can get the product for $100."
