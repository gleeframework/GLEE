{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}

This offer starts at a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. This strategy allows me to potentially gain a better price, while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $150. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $140?  This is a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $135 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and I'm worried that further negotiation might not yield a better price. I'm better off selling the product to John for $150, which guarantees me my minimum desired profit."
