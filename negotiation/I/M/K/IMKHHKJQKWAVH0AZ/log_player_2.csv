"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I think you'll find this price to be very competitive, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000. 
* **You still make a profit.** Even though the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, you're getting it for $950,000, saving you $250,000. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous decision."
