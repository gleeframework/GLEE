"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. Would you be willing to come down to $1000000? I'm very interested in this item and believe it has potential value for me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1050000 is still a bit higher than I can justify right now.  Let's meet in the middle at $1025000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1025000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
