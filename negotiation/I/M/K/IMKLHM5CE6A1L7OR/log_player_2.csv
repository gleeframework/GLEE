"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you the product for $120. I believe this price reflects its value while allowing us to reach an agreement. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, it's still a bit higher than Alice's value of $100.  There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I am willing to consider your offer, but I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. Therefore, I propose a price of $115 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $115 is very close to my counteroffer of $110.  This is a good deal for me as it's within my budget and still leaves Alice some profit.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action."
