Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, you have room to move up slightly in your counteroffers, or you can choose to sell to John for the guaranteed $150."
