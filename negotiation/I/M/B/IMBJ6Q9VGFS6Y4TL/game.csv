"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you than what I'm asking. Let me know your thoughts!",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which still gives you a substantial gain. Let's meet halfway and close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll propose $950000. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product.  While I appreciate your offer, $950000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, at $975000. This price ensures both of us get a good deal, and we can close this negotiation.  What do you say?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. I'll propose $955000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",955000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! $955000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $965000? This price would represent a fair compromise for both of us and bring this negotiation to a close.  Let's make this happen.",965000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $965000. I'll propose $960000, which is as close as I can get to your last offer. If you're willing to meet me here, I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",960000.0,Bob,8,
