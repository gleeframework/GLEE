Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However,  $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but need to stay closer to my original asking price.  How about $900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 900000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but my budget is firm.  I can go up to $750,000.  If that works, we have a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Reason: While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's anchored at a much lower price point than our minimum.  It's unlikely we'll be able to bridge the gap sufficiently in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees our minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation risk."
