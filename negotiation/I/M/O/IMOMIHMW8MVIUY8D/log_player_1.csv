Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really find valuable. I'm asking for $95 for it."", ""product_price"": 95} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $100.  Offering it at $95 leaves a small potential profit for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer seriously. 
* **Above John's Offer:** It's crucial to stay above $80, as that's our guaranteed sale price with John. 

By starting at $95, we give ourselves the best chance to maximize profit while still staying in a range where Bob is likely to engage in negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer for the product. I'm interested in purchasing it, but my budget allows me to spend up to $85. Could we possibly work something out? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $85 is close to our minimum, we still have some negotiating room. It's unlikely Bob would walk away from a deal over a small price difference, especially since he's expressed strong interest.  We'll aim to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is quite high.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This is a classic negotiation tactic that often feels fair to both parties. It shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher price.
* **Above Minimum, Below Initial Offer:**  This keeps the negotiation moving forward. We're conceding from our initial $95 ask while staying above our $80 minimum. 
* **Maintaining Value Proposition:**  We don't want to drop the price too drastically, as it might signal desperation or that the product is worth less than we're claiming."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand the value of the product, I believe we could reach an agreement closer to my budget. Would $87 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** $87 is a reasonable compromise and a decent profit over our $80 guarantee with John. 
* **Risk of Losing the Sale:**  Continuing to push for a higher price might frustrate Bob, leading him to walk away from the deal entirely. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting a good offer now avoids further hassle and allows us to move on."
