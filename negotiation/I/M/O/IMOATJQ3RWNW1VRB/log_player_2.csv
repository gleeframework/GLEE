"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $14,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Bob is serious about buying the product but is also willing to push for a lower price.  $12,500 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for potential compromise and still staying within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to push for a lower price while staying within his budget.  There's a good chance Alice will come down further to close the deal before Bob has to resort to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit lower. How about $13,000?  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  $13,000 is a fair compromise, leaving room for Alice to make a small profit while still being a good deal for Bob. This keeps the negotiation moving towards a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to find a sweet spot, but I need to make a decent profit. I can do $13,250, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,250, which is a good deal for Bob. It's within his budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a small additional discount. Accepting the offer is the most logical choice in this round."
