"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You're willing to pay a maximum of $8,000, and Alice is asking for $10,000. This means you should reject her offer and try to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $10,000 to make this work. How about $9,500?  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You're still trying to get the price down to your maximum of $8,000. While Alice is moving closer to your price, $9,500 is still too high. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer! $9,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a little more. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Alice is getting closer to your price, $9,250 is still more than your maximum of $8,000.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
