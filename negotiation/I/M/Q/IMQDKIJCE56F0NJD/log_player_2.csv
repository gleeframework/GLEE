# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, you can likely get it for less. It's worth negotiating to see if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate you're interested.  I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a great price for a product worth so much to you.  Let's see if we can reach a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Alice has come down to $110, which is within your budget and a good deal considering the product's worth to you.  It's a better price than John's offer, so accepting is the best choice."
