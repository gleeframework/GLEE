"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable item for a one-time price of $15000. It's a unique and exclusive product that I'm confident you'll find valuable, and I'm willing to let it go for this price. If you're interested, please let me know and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $12,000 to me, and Alice is asking for $15,000, which is too expensive. I'll look for a better deal elsewhere.
