"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering my needs and the market value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my initial offer. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we have different perspectives on the product's current value.  Perhaps focusing solely on the price isn't the most productive way forward.  Are there any other factors or possibilities that would make this deal more attractive for you at a price point closer to $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,800,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and demonstrates my genuine interest in this product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
