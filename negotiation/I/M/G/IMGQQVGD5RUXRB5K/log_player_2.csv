"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than my maximum budget and what John offers. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a low counter-offer to gauge Alice's flexibility. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my budget and John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice lowered her price, but it's still above both my target price and John's offer. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about $70? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm incrementally increasing my offer, showing Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but still staying below both my budget and John's offer. This keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $70 is still a bit low for me, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer to an acceptable price, but it's still above John's offer. I'll continue negotiating, but I'm ready to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't budge significantly in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm on a tight budget.  I can do $75, but that's my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm making a smaller counter-offer this time and setting a firm limit at $75.  This signals to Alice that I'm serious about my budget, but still open to a deal slightly better than John's offer. This is a crucial point in the negotiation, and I'm prepared to walk away if Alice doesn't meet my price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is your limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I'll throw in a special bonus that's worth $10. So, I'll sell the product to you for $75, plus the bonus. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is a great outcome! While I don't have concrete details about the bonus, getting the product for $75 effectively beats John's offer. It's unlikely Alice will go any lower, and this deal meets my needs."
