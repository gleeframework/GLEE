"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth the price of $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Let's negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit high for me though. Could you do it for $90?"",

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much wiggle room Alice is willing to give."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $90 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. Let's try to get a bit closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $90 might have been a bit low.  Would you consider $98?"",

}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice I'm willing to move upward, but still keeps me within my target budget."
