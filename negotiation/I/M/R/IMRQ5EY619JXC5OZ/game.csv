"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $10,000. This is a high-quality item that could significantly benefit you, given its value to you is estimated at $8,000. I believe this price strikes a good balance between our respective valuations.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product's quality, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? I believe it's a fair price that considers both our valuations.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must respectfully decline your offer of $6,000. Considering the product's value to you and my need to recover some of the investment, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $7,500. This price aims to bridge the gap between our valuations while still providing a reasonable profit margin for me.",7500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $7,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
