"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $12000. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, it's still more than the product's worth to Alice.  There's potential for further negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  How about $10,000?  I think that's a fair price considering your value for the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $11500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's goal, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11750. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get a better deal than $11,750.  While it's getting closer to his target, there's still a little room to negotiate. He can likely get a better price by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,750 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? I think that's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11750 again, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll also give you a 1-year warranty on the product. How about that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is still aiming for a lower price, the added value of a 1-year warranty makes this offer very attractive. It's a significant benefit that could justify paying a slightly higher price.  Additionally, with only 3 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep pushing for a lower price, especially as Alice hasn't budged much. Accepting this offer is a good compromise and likely the best outcome for Bob considering the limited rounds remaining."
