"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to go that high yet. I'd like to offer you $1000000 for it.  This price reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair starting point for us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the product's true value to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1150000. This is a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I'm interested in the product, $1150000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1050000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and it allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1080000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
