I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. This is an unbeatable deal, considering its true value to me is no less than $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price ($850,000 vs $1,000,000).  While it's possible Alice is undervaluing the product, accepting her offer saves Bob $150,000.  This is a good deal for Bob, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible price."
