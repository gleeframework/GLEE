"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial value of $1,000,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate the product's value, my budget for this purchase is significantly lower.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, $900,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Bob is better off continuing to negotiate with Alice to try to get closer to his desired price point of $800,000. There is still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're getting closer to your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm open to finalizing the deal.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, the negotiation has stalled.  Alice is unwilling to go below $925,000, which is still above Bob's budget.  Rather than continue to haggle and risk getting further away from his goal, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $800,000.  This ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation failure."
