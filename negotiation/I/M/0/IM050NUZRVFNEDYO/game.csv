"Alice, thank you for your offer.  While I appreciate the product's value, my budget for this purchase is significantly lower.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and is within my financial constraints.  I'm eager to work with you to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of the product. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $875,000. This price is a significant step closer to my budget, and I'm hopeful that we can reach a final agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
