"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1600000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and your initial offer. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1400000. Can you consider a price of $1450000? This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1450000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll counter with $1525000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and your previous offers. What do you think?",1525000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll counter with $1575000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
