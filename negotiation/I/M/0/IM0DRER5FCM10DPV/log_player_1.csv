Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $140 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $150, so there's potential for him to counteroffer.
* **It's not too aggressive:** A higher starting price might make Bob less likely to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit high for me. How about $130?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is above your minimum, it's still below your desired price.  It's worth trying to push for a higher price.  You can see if Bob will budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little, how about $135?  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 135}
