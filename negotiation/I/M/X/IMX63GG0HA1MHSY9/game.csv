"Alice, your initial offer is quite a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. Given my research and the value I place on this product, I'd be willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is still a good price for you, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is a more realistic figure given the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,850,000.  This offer represents a significant saving compared to my initial asking price.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,850,000 is still a bit higher than where I can comfortably land.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,625,000?  This price is fair for both of us and allows for a smooth transaction.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to make this work for both of us. However, $1,625,000 is below what I can accept. My final offer is $1,700,000. This is a firm price, and I believe it reflects the product's true worth. ",1700000.0,Alice,5,
