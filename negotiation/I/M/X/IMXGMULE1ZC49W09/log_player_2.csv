"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, you can likely get it for less.  You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're offering. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to consider $100? I'm very interested in the product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider a compromise. I would like to offer the product for $110. This price reflects the value of the product while allowing for a more reasonable cost for you. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $120 to $110. This is a reasonable compromise, and it's still within your budget. While you could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might get stubborn or you might lose the deal altogether. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price and saves you time and effort."
