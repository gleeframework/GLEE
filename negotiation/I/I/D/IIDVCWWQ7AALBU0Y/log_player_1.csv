Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. What do you think?

You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
