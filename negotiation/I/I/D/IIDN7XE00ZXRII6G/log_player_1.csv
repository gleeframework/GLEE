{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a rare opportunity and I believe it's well worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $800,000 to me.  I'll adjust based on Bob's response, but I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer meets my minimum, I'm not satisfied with just breaking even. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to make this deal work. This is still a fantastic price for a product of this caliber. Let's find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down.  $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $850000? It's a fair compromise that respects both our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than John's offer, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
