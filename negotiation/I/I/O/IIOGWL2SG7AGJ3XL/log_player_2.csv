"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth more to you than that and I'm still getting a good price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, you can potentially get a better deal. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of:

* **Alice making a counteroffer:** She might be willing to go lower to secure the sale. 
* **Sticking with John:** You have a guaranteed fallback option at $15,000. 

By rejecting, you're not losing anything yet and might save an extra $1,000."
