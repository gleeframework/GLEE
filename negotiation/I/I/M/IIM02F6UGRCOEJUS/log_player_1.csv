Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a bit lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob might be willing to accept it as it's still a good deal for him, considering the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. However, if he rejects, I'm prepared to counteroffer or go to John for the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $1,500,000. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm offering $1,350,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's a step towards meeting him halfway. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough to make the deal worthwhile. I'm confident that John will pay my minimum price, guaranteeing me a more profitable outcome."
