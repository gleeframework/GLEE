Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to come down to $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more offer: I'll sell it to you for $112.50. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",112.5,Alice,5,
