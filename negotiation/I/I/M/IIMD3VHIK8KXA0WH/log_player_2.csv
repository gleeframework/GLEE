Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to come down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more offer: I'll sell it to you for $112.50. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer.  While you'd prefer a lower price, $112.50 is within your budget and getting closer to your target price. There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer in the next round and it's possible Alice will walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
