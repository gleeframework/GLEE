Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Friendly approach:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By asking ""What do you think?"", I'm inviting Bob to respond with a counteroffer, allowing the negotiation to progress.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to Bob's value ($120) as possible, while still ensuring I make a decent profit. I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I won't go below $80 (my minimum) because I have a fallback option with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:** Bob's offer of $90 is close to my desired outcome. While I could potentially squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of continuing negotiation is that Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $80. 
* **Time Factor:**  There's no indication of a time constraint, but every round of negotiation takes time. Accepting Bob's offer is a quick and relatively profitable solution.

**Strategy:**

Accepting this offer secures a good profit ($10 more than my minimum) and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely. It's a pragmatic approach that balances my desire for profit with the need to reach a mutually acceptable agreement."
