Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I believe a price of $10,000 is fair, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down even slightly.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** The fact that you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000 gives you leverage.  You don't *need* to go below that price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is phrased to encourage Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open. 

**Important Note:**  While $10,000 is a reasonable starting point, gauging Bob's interest and potential counter-offers will be crucial in maximizing your profit."
