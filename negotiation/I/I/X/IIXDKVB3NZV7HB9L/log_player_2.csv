"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $110. This is a great deal for both of us, as I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer of $110 is less than your maximum price of $120 and also cheaper than buying from John for $120. This saves you money and gets you the product."
