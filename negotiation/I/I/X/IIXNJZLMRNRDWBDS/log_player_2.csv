{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly very good at negotiating, and is unlikely to go much lower than $109.  While you might be able to eek out another dollar or two, it's not worth the risk of her walking away or running out of rounds.  $109 is a good price and you should accept the deal."
