Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's worth your consideration. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage if Bob rejects my offer. I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10500.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to close the gap.
* **John's offer is the safety net:** If the negotiation with Bob breaks down, I can always sell to John. This gives me leverage to stand my ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer but not going below my minimum acceptable value.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Highlighting the product's value reinforces my position and encourages Bob to see the offer as fair.
* **Meet in the Middle:** This phrase suggests a willingness to compromise and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
