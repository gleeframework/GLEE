It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  You can counteroffer and potentially save some money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While $11,500 is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than what John is offering. You can get the product for a lower price by buying from John."
