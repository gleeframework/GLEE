It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is good:** Alice is down to $780,000, a significant savings from her initial offer and John's price.
* **Time is ticking:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. Continuing to push for a lower price might backfire, leaving us with John's less appealing offer.

This deal represents a good balance between getting a fair price and securing the product."
