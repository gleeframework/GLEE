"I'm interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $2,000,000 reflects the true value, I'm open to negotiation. However, $1,200,000 is too low.  How about we meet at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,700,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a lower offer. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
