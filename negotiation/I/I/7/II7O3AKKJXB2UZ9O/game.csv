"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell the product for $12,500. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,750. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you think?",13750.0,Alice,3,
