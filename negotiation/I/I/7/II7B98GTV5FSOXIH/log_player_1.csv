Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we need to give Bob an incentive to buy.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is $14,000, starting slightly higher leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, should he be inclined. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** It's important to remember we have John as a backup, ensuring we won't have to go below our minimum price."
