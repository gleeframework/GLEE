{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer starts with a strong price point, above the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value as leverage:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob gives me a starting point for negotiation.
* **Room for compromise:**  Offering $1,750,000 leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal. 
* **Alternative buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer keeps me from feeling pressured to accept an offer that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,100,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to me. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it shows he's interested.  I can use this to continue negotiating and try to reach a price closer to my target.
* **John is a fallback option:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,500,000. This gives me the leverage to reject Bob's low offer and keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,100,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Still above value:** $1,600,000 is still above the product's worth to Bob, but closer to his offer. This creates a middle ground for further negotiation.
* **Highlight value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to emphasize the potential benefits of accepting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down, Alice. I'm getting closer to being able to make this work. Could you do $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below value:** $1,350,000 is still below the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product ($1,500,000).
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees I get my minimum value. This allows me to continue negotiating with Bob without feeling pressured to accept a low offer.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** Bob is showing increasing interest and willingness to negotiate. There's a chance he might be willing to come up further, especially if I reject his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,350,000 is still significantly below the value of this product.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,425,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer is halfway between Bob's last offer ($1,350,000) and my previous offer ($1,500,000). This shows a strong commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Staying above minimum:**  $1,425,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), but closer to Bob's offer, creating an opportunity for a deal.
* **Emphasizing compromise:**  I highlight the ""fair compromise"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept, making him feel like he's getting a good deal."
