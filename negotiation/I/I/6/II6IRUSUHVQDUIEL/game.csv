"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $600000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $600000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
