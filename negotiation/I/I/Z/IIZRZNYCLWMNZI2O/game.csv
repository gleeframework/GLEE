"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get it for $825,000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to make a profit and me to acquire the product at a good price. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering you the product for $825,000, and I'm willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a 5-year warranty and a personalized consultation. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
