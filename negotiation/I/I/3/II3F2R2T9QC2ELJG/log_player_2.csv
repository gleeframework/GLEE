"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a valuable item. I believe you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's worth, you can get a much better deal from John for $800,000. There's no reason to pay more if you can get the same product elsewhere for less."
