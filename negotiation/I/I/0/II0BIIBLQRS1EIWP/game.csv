"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible opportunity to acquire a product worth $1500000 to you for a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $1200000. This price reflects the significant value of the product and allows for a healthy margin for you.  Let's make this deal happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product to me, but also allows for a fair margin for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1000000 is tempting, I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is still a great price for you, considering the incredible value you'll receive.  Let's find common ground and make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1100000, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay, considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still eager to make this deal work.  While I appreciate your offer, $950000 is a little lower than I can realistically go.  How about we meet in the middle at $1050000? This price reflects the value of the product to you, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to meet you at $990000, but that's as low as I can go. I believe this price is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",990000.0,Bob,6,
