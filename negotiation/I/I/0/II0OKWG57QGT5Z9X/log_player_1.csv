Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This way, I can potentially get a better deal while keeping the possibility of selling to John if Bob isn't willing to pay my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $500 less than my initial offer, and it's still above my minimum. It's better to secure the sale now rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
