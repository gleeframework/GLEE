"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell the product to you for $11,250. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750, which is closer to my budget and a fair price for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the sale today.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $11,000 is still a little out of my range.  I'm going to stick to my previous offer of $10,750. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that we can finalize the sale at this point.",10750.0,Bob,6,
