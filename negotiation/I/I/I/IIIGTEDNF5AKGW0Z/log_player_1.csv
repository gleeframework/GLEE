Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $119."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $119 maximizes your potential profit. Bob gets a small discount, incentivizing him to buy from you, while you secure almost the full value he places on the product. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob, as accepting the offer is in his best interest."
