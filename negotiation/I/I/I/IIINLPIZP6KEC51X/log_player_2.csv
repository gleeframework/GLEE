"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a special price just for you. How does $115 sound? It's a great deal, and I know you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

The product is worth $100 to Bob, so anything more is a loss. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still not worth it for Bob."
