Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're getting stuck. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $14,000? It's the last concession I can make.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to go below $14,000.  You have a guaranteed option to buy from John for $10,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice and potentially missing out on the guaranteed saving."
