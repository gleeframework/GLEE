"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be happy to pay $10000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're asking for $13500, but I'm still only comfortable with $10000. It's my final offer, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase if you're willing to accept it.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any lower than $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - I'll consider $12500. That's the best I can do. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
