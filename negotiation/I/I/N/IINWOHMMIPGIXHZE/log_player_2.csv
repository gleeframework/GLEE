"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's own valuation of $120. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the great price, but I'm looking to spend a little less.  How about $125?  I'm sure we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $135. It's a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $135 is still higher than her own valuation of $120 and closer to my maximum budget of $150. However, there's still potential for further negotiation. It's worth seeing if she'll come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still a little high. Let's split the difference. $130 is my final offer.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $135 again, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reiterated her offer of $135.  While I would prefer $130, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  If I reject this offer and counter again, there's a chance she'll stick to her guns, and I'll have to buy from John at $150.  $135 is a good price, and within my budget.  It's time to take the deal."
