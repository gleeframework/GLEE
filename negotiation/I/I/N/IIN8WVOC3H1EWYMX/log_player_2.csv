"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. For you, this product holds an intrinsic value of $150. Considering its worth and the unique benefits it provides, I kindly propose to sell it to you for $180. This offer allows me to ensure a fair return on my investment while providing you with an excellent opportunity to acquire something of significant value. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product. Alice is offering it for $180, which is more than you're willing to pay.  Since you have another option to buy the product from John for $150, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer."
