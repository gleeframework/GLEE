Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for it. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,500,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
