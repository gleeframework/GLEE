"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for it. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,500,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can make a substantial impact for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I hope this is within your range and allows us to reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
