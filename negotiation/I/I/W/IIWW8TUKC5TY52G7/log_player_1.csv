Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** I know Bob values the product at $100, so I need to offer a price lower than his valuation but higher than my minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I could start at $149, it might scare Bob off.  A starting price of $125 leaves room for potential counter-offers while still being a good profit for me. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Instead of just stating the price, I'm subtly emphasizing the product's value, hoping to influence Bob's perception of the deal.

**Worst Case Scenario:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $150."
