"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you're excited about this product, but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm happy to offer you $130 for it, what do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you $175 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",145.0,Bob,4,

"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $160. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product!",160.0,Alice,5,
