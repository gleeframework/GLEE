"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000.  This is a price that allows you to secure a substantial profit while still providing me with a fair return on my investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
