"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're sticking to your last offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $102. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's worth it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again!",102.0,Alice,7,
