Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to be mindful of your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring to you.

**Reasoning:**  Alice is very unlikely to go below $11,000.  While you *might* be able to negotiate her down a little further, it's not worth the risk of her digging in at this price. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, which is a better outcome than risking a higher price with Alice."
