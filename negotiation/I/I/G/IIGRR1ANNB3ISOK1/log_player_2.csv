"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can do better than $1,200,000. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  He has room to go lower before reaching his maximum price of $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering Alice a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her desired selling price of $1,000,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still potentially giving Bob a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000, and while he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his counteroffer and he'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product for a price he's comfortable with."
