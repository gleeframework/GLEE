Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200.  This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. I'll see what Bob's reaction is and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  $50 is significantly less than my minimum of $150. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is still higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  It's also a significant amount higher than my minimum, so I'm still in a good position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. Although it's closer to my minimum, it's still not worth it to sell for that price. I'll counteroffer again, but I'm starting to feel like John might be the better option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $160. This is still above my minimum, but it shows I'm trying to meet Bob halfway. However, if he rejects this offer again, I'll likely sell to John for $150."
