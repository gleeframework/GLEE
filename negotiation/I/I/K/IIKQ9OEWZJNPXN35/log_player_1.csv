"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The language used emphasizes that this is an initial offer and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation process.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value and potential, reinforcing its desirability.

This approach aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's willingness to pay:** His response will indicate how far apart your valuations are.
2. **Establish bargaining power:**  Starting high gives you leverage in subsequent rounds.

Remember, John's offer provides a safety net, ensuring you won't settle for less than your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's too early to settle.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a higher price, especially since you have ample rounds remaining and John's offer as a safety net.  Accepting now would leave potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,500,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and its potential. To find a mutually agreeable price, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This reflects the product's unique value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant concession ($250,000) to signal flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, we're still aiming high ($2,000,000) to maintain negotiating power and test Bob's upper limit. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's value to justify the higher price. 

By making a substantial move but not completely meeting Bob's offer, we aim to gauge his seriousness and encourage him to make a counteroffer closer to our target range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, moving his offer up by $250,000.  While $1,750,000 is a good offer, we're still in a strong position:

* **We have time:**  Plenty of rounds remain to negotiate.
* **Bob is engaged:**  He's responding with reasonable counteroffers.
* **John's offer is our safety net:** We won't be forced to accept a low offer.

It's worth risking another counteroffer to try and secure a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between the product's value and your budget considerations. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** This time, we're reducing our ask by only $100,000.  This signals that we're getting closer to our bottom line while still encouraging Bob to move upward.
* **Seeking Compromise:**  The message emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Direct Question:**  We're directly asking for Bob's input to encourage further engagement and gauge his willingness to meet us closer to our price. 

We're aiming to strike a deal above $1,750,000 without dragging the negotiation too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has increased his offer again, now to $1,850,000.  This is a strong price, exceeding our minimum and representing a significant gain from his initial offer.  Here's why accepting makes sense now:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield small incremental gains, but risks pushing Bob away or prolonging the deal unnecessarily.
* **Good Faith:**  Accepting demonstrates goodwill and a willingness to compromise, potentially fostering a positive relationship with Bob for future dealings.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays or unforeseen circumstances that could arise with further negotiation. 

While we might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the current offer represents a very favorable outcome."
