"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $1,080,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
