"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum value of $80. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm. However, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it, which is still a good value for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $100. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum value of $80.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price, but I also want to keep in mind the opportunity cost of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing the chance to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100.  I'm still not quite there.  How about $90?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95. It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is getting closer to my target price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice for one more round to see if I can get her down to my price. However, if she doesn't budge, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit more.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on this and offer $92.  It's a good price for both of us, and it'll help us close this deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still think I can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $94. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $94. While that's getting close to my desired price, I've already had several rounds of negotiation.  There are only a few rounds left, and I'm not sure if I can get her down to my price of $90, even if I counteroffer again. 

It's more efficient and less risky for me to simply buy from John at $80, as I'm guaranteed to get the product within my budget."
