Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $90 is closer to my budget, I can still try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $75 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer it to you for $85. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and $85 is within my budget. It's better to accept a slightly higher price than risk losing the deal and potentially missing out on the product altogether."
