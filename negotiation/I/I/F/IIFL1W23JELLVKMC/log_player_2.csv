"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to him, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still above his budget.  He should try to negotiate a lower price again."

Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer is still higher than Bob's budget.  While it's tempting to try to negotiate further, John's offer guarantees Bob the product for a price within his budget. It's better to secure the product at a known price than to risk further negotiation with Alice."
