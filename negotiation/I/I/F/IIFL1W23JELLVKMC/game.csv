"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850000 at this time. This is a fair price, considering the value I place on the product and my available funds.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product and the original price I had in mind.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair reflection of the value I place on the product.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
