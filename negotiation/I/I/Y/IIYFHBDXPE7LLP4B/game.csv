"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is still a little high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $105.  If you're willing to come down to that, I'll take it. Otherwise, I'll have to go with John's offer.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $108, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. I'm getting a little concerned that if we don't come to an agreement, I might miss out on the sale to John. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
