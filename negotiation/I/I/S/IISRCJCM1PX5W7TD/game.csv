"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I was really hoping we could do better than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,500, but I'll throw in a free additional feature that's worth $500?",10000.0,Alice,7,
