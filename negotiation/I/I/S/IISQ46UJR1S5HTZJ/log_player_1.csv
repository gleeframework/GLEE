"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Reason:Bob is offering $110, which is more than my minimum acceptable price of $100. While I could try to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee I'd get a better offer. Accepting now secures a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether.
