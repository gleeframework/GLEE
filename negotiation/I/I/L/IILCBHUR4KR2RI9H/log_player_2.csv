# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great value, considering the product's worth to me is at least $800000. What do you think?

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is at least $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget of $800,000. While it's closer, I'm still willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there yet. How about $800,000? This is my absolute top price, and it's also the price I can get it from another seller.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your top price. I'm willing to meet you at $795000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me is at least $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $5,000 above my maximum budget. This is a small enough difference that it's worth accepting the offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a higher price or a deal falling through.  It's also a better price than what I can get from John."
