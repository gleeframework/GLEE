"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I need to be closer to my initial price. How about $105? This would be a fair deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105.",95.0,Bob,4,
