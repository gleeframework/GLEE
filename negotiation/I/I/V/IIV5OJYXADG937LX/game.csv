"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the uniqueness of the product, but $12000 is my maximum budget. I'm willing to pay $10000. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to find common ground. However, I was really hoping to get closer to the original price I had in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to reach a number that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10500? This would allow us to close the deal quickly and fairly.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your position, but $11500 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $11000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to the final stretch, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I can offer it to you for $11500, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my absolute final offer. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we've been going back and forth, and while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11500 is still a bit too high for me. To make this a win-win for both of us, I'm willing to offer $11250. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal in this round.",11250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11500. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point of diminishing returns. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to feel like we're getting close to a mutually beneficial price. I'm offering it to you for $11750. This is my absolute last offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this exceptional product. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,9,
