Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $10,750?  Let's close this deal, I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll make a profit. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm running out of time, I'm not willing to settle for less than $10,750 yet. I'll make one more counteroffer to Bob in the next round. If he rejects it, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about $10,650? This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for both of us. I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 10650}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,650 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,600.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my minimum of $12,000, it's getting late in the negotiations and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. $10,600 is a decent price, and it's better than selling to John for $12,000."
