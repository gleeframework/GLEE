"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it's worth a lot, so I'm starting with a price of $100. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about $75?  I'm really interested in this product, but I have a strict budget.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little. How about $85?  I'm confident you'll find it worth the extra investment.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $85 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $80? I'm really eager to get this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
