"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than her value of $800,000. There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Since you have 10 rounds and John's offer is a safety net, it's worth exploring further negotiations with Alice."

I believe this is the minimum price I can accept for the product, considering its value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $910,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're sticking to your number, but I'm still not there yet.  Let's meet in the middle once more. How about $890,000? This would give us both a solid deal, and I'm confident it would be a good outcome for both of us."", ""product_price"": 890000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your enthusiasm, but I'm still not willing to go below $910,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $902,500. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are down to the last round, and Alice's offer is still above my target price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching a deal and having to pay John's higher price is too high.  It's more prudent to secure the product now from John, even at a higher price, to ensure I get the product I need."
