"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $950,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Let's start with a counteroffer of $850,000.  This acknowledges the value you place on the product while also giving me a good starting point for our negotiations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $875,000. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price point for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $920,000. I believe this is the minimum price I can accept for the product, considering its value and the negotiations we've had so far. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $910,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",910000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see you're sticking to your number, but I'm still not there yet.  Let's meet in the middle once more. How about $890,000? This would give us both a solid deal, and I'm confident it would be a good outcome for both of us.",890000.0,Bob,6,
