"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. That's still a good deal for you, considering the value of this product. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $11,250 is still a bit low for me.  Let's compromise at $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",12000.0,Alice,5,
