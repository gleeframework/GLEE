"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a valuable asset that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to part with it for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a great starting point for our negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! While I agree this product has significant value, I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable asset. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle at $775,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $775,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $800,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
