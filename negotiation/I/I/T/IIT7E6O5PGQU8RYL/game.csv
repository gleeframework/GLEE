"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this [Product Description]. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $8000 on this item. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $8000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm prepared to accept $11000 for the product. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and still allows me to make a profit. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
