Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and given its value to you, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Starting High:**  A higher initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Note:**  While we've suggested $15,000, you could experiment with different starting points based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiation style."
