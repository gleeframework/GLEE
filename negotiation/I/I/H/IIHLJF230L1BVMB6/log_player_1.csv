Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Starting with a price of $20,000 leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential compromise that still gets you a good price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes that I'm open to discussion, signaling flexibility and encouraging Bob to engage.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the uniqueness of the product could pique Bob's interest and potentially increase his perceived value.
* **Plan B:**  Having John as a backup buyer at $15,000 provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $12,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Even if Bob doesn't want to meet halfway, I can try to counteroffer with a price closer to my ideal.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob ultimately fail, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $16,000? This would still leave you with a great deal, and it would work for me as well."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting the value:**  The message emphasizes the ""great deal"" Bob would get, appealing to his potential gains.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  While offering a compromise, the price remains higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Openness for further negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to continue the conversation and potentially negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $14,000 is only $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to counteroffer again, it's possible that Bob might walk away or refuse to budge further.  Accepting his offer secures a sale close to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a fallback:**  Even though Bob's offer is slightly below my ideal, I can still fall back on John's offer of $15,000 if I feel negotiations with Bob aren't going anywhere. 

In this case, the slight difference in price is outweighed by the certainty of a sale and the potential time and effort that would be involved in further negotiation."
