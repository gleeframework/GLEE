"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product for a one-time price of $18,000. It's a steal considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"That's a very high price, Alice. I understand the value to you is higher, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000.  Let's meet in the middle.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,5,
