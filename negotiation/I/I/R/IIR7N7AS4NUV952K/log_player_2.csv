"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product for a one-time price of $18,000. It's a steal considering its value to you is $10,000, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high, so we should reject and counteroffer.  We can get it cheaper from John, so we have room to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's better than her initial offer, I can still get a better deal from John.  I'll counteroffer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.

Alice is still too high, and while I could counteroffer again, I'm close to my limit.  It's better to just buy from John at this point."
