At this point, Bob is very close to the halfway point between his initial offer and your ""final"" offer in round 5.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield significantly more profit and runs the risk of Bob walking away. Accepting the $956,250 ensures a very good profit and a successful deal closure."
