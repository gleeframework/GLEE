Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already met you halfway earlier, and I'm willing to give you a slight concession.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,500 is your final offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'll sell the product to you for $12,200. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.

It seems unlikely Alice will go much lower than $12,200. Accepting this offer allows you to purchase the product for significantly less than John's $15,000 price."
