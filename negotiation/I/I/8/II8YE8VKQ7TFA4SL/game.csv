"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,500. This offer is fair to both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about we meet at $9,800? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get closer to my target price.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're looking for a good price, and I'm trying to be fair. However, $9,800 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,150? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it's closer to my target price. What do you think?",10150.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about we meet at $9,900? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible.",9900.0,Bob,6,
