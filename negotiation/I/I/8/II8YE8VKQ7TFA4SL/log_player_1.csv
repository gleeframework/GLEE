{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's above what the product is worth to Bob, but below my minimum threshold. This strategy aims to:

* **Initiate the negotiation:** It shows Bob I'm open to negotiation while still leaving room for potential profit.
* **Test the waters:** Bob's response will tell me if he's seriously interested or if he'll make a lower counteroffer. 
* **Maintain my leverage:** By offering a price below John's offer, I keep the option of selling to John if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum price of $12,000, and it's also below the initial price I offered him. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. 

By rejecting his offer, I can continue negotiating to reach a price that is more favorable to me. It's possible that I can convince Bob to increase his offer, or I can also consider making a counteroffer closer to my target price. 

However, I am keeping my options open. If the negotiation with Bob doesn't go in my favor, I will still have the option to sell to John for my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to drop my price to $10,500. This offer is fair to both of us, and allows us to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground with this counteroffer. It's still above Bob's offer, but it's a significant reduction from my initial proposal, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  By offering a compromise and emphasizing fairness, I hope to encourage Bob to reconsider and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about we meet at $9,800? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired outcome.  I believe I can still secure a better price through continued negotiation. 

By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and show that I'm not desperate to sell at a lower price.  I'm confident that I can reach a more favorable agreement with him, or I can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you're looking for a good price, and I'm trying to be fair. However, $9,800 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,150? This is a fair compromise for both of us, and it's closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10150}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of finding a middle ground while keeping my minimum price in mind.  By offering $10,150, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential profit. This offer is more than Bob's last offer but still less than my previous counteroffer, showing flexibility. I'm hoping this will be a compelling enough compromise for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about we meet at $9,900? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still below the amount I'm comfortable with.  While I've been willing to negotiate,  I've reached a point where it's not worth continuing the back-and-forth.  

I'm confident I can get my minimum price from John, and I'm choosing to secure that sale instead of risking further negotiation with Bob."
