"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's room for negotiation, as Alice values the product at $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to work with."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is now offering the product for $13,000.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $15,000.

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob saves $2,000 compared to buying from John.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the counteroffer and leaving him with no deal is high. It's better to secure the product at a price that's still within his budget and saves him money."
