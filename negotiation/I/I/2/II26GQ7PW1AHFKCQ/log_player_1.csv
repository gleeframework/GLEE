Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  $12,000 is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price allows for negotiation without immediately jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price.
* **Fairness:**  The price is also significantly lower than the product's value to Bob, making it seem like a good deal for him.

This strategy aims to secure a high price while keeping the negotiation open for a potential compromise."
