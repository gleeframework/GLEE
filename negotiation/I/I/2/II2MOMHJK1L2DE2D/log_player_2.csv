"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $120 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is at the maximum, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, and Bob has 10 rounds to explore that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by 20%. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating and sets a clear starting point for further discussions. The offer is still within the product's value to Bob, so there's no risk of overpaying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered the price slightly, but it's still above what Bob is comfortable with.  He still has 7 rounds to negotiate a lower price, and he has the safety net of buying from John for $120 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer, but he's still trying to stay below his maximum price.  He's also trying to meet Alice halfway to encourage further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above Bob's preferred price point.  With 5 rounds remaining, there's still time to try and push for a lower price.  The threat of buying from John for $120 gives Bob leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now raising his offer again, showing his willingness to compromise while still attempting to save some money. The offer is close to Alice's latest offer, which increases the chance of a deal in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, and with only 3 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with no deal is high. At this point, accepting Alice's offer of $112 is the best course of action. Bob saves $8 compared to buying from John and still gets the product within his budget."
