"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,000,000. Would you consider accepting $950,000 for the product? I believe this is a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not able to meet the price of $975,000. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose $960,000 as a potential price for the product. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",960000.0,Bob,4,
