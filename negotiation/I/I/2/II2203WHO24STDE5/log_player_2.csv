"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1000000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly below its worth to you. Please consider this offer carefully, as I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so I'm sure she's not making a huge loss by selling it to me for $1,000,000. I can get the same product for $800,000 from John, so I'll reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead.
