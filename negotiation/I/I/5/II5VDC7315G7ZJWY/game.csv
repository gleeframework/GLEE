"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate the opportunity to buy this product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $90? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $100, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer, as I'm happy to buy the product from John for the same price.",100.0,Bob,4,
