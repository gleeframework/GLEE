"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since Bob's maximum budget is $150, and Alice's initial offer is at that limit, there's potential to save money by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer opens the door to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $125 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price:**  $135 is closer to Bob's target of $125 than Alice's initial offer of $150. 
* **There's little room for further negotiation:**  By rejecting Alice's counteroffer, Bob risks Alice either sticking to her price or escalating the negotiation, potentially leading to a price higher than $135. 
* **John's offer is not a better deal:** Buying from John would cost Bob $150, so accepting Alice's offer is still a better option in terms of price."
