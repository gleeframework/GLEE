"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit below that. How about we try $920,000? I'm getting close to my target, and I'd like to make this deal happen.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're committed to this deal, and I appreciate that. While $920,000 is closer, it's still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $935,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally get this transaction done.",935000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit below $935,000. How about we try $915,000? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",915000.0,Bob,6,
