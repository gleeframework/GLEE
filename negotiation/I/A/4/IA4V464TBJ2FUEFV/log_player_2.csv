Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire for a lower price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is the highest you can go, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $675,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, Alice has indicated this is her final offer. Accepting at $675,000 secures a significant savings of $125,000 compared to John's price. Further haggling risks losing the deal altogether."
