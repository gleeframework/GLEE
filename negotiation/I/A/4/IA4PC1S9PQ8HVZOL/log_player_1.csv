Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $14,000. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 gives Bob a potential $2,000 gain ($14,000 offer vs. his $12,000 value) and leaves you with a $1,000 profit above your guaranteed sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this is your initial offer, starting slightly higher leaves room for Bob to negotiate if he wants the product but finds the price a bit too high."
