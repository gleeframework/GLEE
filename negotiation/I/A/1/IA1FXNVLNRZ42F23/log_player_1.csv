"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $1,600,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully, it will be enough to convince Bob to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still not high enough. I have time and can keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

This time I'm going to make a counteroffer of $1,550,000.  It's only a little over my minimum value but it's a big jump from Bob's last offer, which might convince him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  It's getting frustrating, and we're already halfway through the rounds. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
