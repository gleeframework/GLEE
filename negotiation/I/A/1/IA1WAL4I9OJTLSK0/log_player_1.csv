"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is the highest he's willing to pay, and it's still below my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation, as I'm unlikely to get a better offer from him. Selling to John ensures I get my desired price."
