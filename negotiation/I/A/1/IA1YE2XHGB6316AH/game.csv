"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but I was hoping to spend a little less. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $6,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $6,800. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",6800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going up to $6,600. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a new price of $6,900. This is the final price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",6900.0,Alice,5,
