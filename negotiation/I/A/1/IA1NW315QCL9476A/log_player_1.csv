{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its market value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is a good starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit for Alice. It is also high enough to encourage Bob to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I can still aim for a better price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my ideal price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000. This would still be a great deal for you, as you'd be getting a valuable product at a price well below its true worth. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and consider $875,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to my ideal price and is significantly higher than what I would get from John. Accepting this offer is a good compromise and ensures a solid profit for me."
