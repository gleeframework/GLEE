Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I believe it's worth $10,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. This offer is valid for 24 hours."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Creating Value Perception:** By mentioning that you believe the product is worth $10,000, you subtly anchor Bob's perception of its value higher than his initial assessment.
* **Time Constraint:** Adding a 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly rather than overthink or negotiate the price down further.
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll get your minimum price if Bob declines. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that's likely attractive considering he values the product at $8,000."
