"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1500000 is at the very top of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential value. Let me know if you're open to discussing it further.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 is significantly below my minimum valuation. I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price still leaves room for you to potentially profit, and it's closer to what I consider a fair price for this unique item. Let me know your thoughts on this offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your price.  $1350000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm willing to offer $1250000.  This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.  What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
