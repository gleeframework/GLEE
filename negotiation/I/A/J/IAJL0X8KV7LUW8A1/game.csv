"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that? ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. Let's meet in the middle; how about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm really hoping to get this product for closer to my initial offer of $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I can't let this go for such a low price.  $13,000 is my final offer - it's a great deal for this product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
