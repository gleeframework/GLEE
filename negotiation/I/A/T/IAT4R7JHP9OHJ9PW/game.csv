"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with $1,000,000. Given my budget, I can only go as high as $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential savings for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $925,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for some negotiation room. Let me know if you're interested.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $925,000 is still slightly outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This represents a significant saving for you and allows me to stay within my financial limits. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
