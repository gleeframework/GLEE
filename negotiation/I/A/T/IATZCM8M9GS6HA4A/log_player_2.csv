Alice's offer:

This would still be a great deal for you, and allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $1,125,000? This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair and mutually beneficial price.  Let's close this deal!

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is a significant savings compared to John's offer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
