Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) than my minimum ($80). This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Profit:**  The $100 offer ensures a significant profit above my minimum selling price to John.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  While a higher offer might tempt Bob to reject it, the potential for a $20 profit over selling to John makes this a calculated risk."
