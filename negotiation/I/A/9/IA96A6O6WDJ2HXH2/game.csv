"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",19000.0,Alice,3,
