"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,500 is still below what I need.  How about we settle on $12,500? This is a fair compromise and would allow both of us to walk away satisfied.",12500.0,Alice,5,
