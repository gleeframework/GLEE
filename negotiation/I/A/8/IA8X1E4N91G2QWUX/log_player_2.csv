"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $1,100,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for Bob at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can see that you're interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to go down to $1,075,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice has come down to $1,075,000, Bob can still potentially get a better price. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially achieve a lower price closer to his goal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $1,075,000 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,062,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1062500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000 was a bit of a stretch for me, but $1,062,500 is getting closer to my minimum. However, I think I can do better than that.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While Alice has come down to $1,070,000, Bob believes he can still negotiate a better price.  He is committed to getting the best possible deal and isn't willing to settle just yet.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate allows him to potentially achieve a price closer to his target of $1,050,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you continuing to work with me.  While your offer of $1,070,000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,062,500.  I believe we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference again and agree on a price of $1,066,250.  This is a fair price for both parties, and I'm ready to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1066250}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,066,250, but I need to get a bit closer to my target. I'm willing to go down to $1,068,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,068,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,068,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,068,750 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $1,066,250.  At this point, continuing to negotiate may risk losing the deal altogether.  Alice has indicated that this is her final offer, and Bob has limited rounds remaining.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product while still saving a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
