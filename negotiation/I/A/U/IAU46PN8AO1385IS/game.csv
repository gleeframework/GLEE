,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $11,500.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go below $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $12,250.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",12250.0,Bob,4,
