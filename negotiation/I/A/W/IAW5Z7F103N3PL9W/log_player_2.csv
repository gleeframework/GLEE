# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $90. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $90. While this is a good deal, you can still get it cheaper from John for $100.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy it from John."
