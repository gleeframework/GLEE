"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly lower than its true worth.  It's a win-win situation for both of us!  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get a better deal from John for $1,000,000.  You should reject Alice's offer and proceed to buy from John."
