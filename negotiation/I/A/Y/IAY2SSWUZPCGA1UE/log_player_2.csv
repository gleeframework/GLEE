"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You have a lot of room to negotiate and can potentially get the price down closer to your ideal range. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to propose a price of $950,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $950,000 undervalues the product's true potential and the benefits it can bring to your business.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,050,000 is still above your ideal price range. You have time to negotiate further and can try to get a better deal. There's still room to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
