"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $6,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its market value.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still finding it a bit high. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
