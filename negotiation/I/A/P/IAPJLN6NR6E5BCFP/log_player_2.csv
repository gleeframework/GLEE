"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is way too high.**  You're only willing to pay $100, and her offer is $75 more than that. 
* **There's no reason to accept this offer.** You have other options, including a guaranteed price from John. 
* **Rejecting the offer gives you a chance to negotiate.** You can start with a counteroffer closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with your maximum price:** You're willing to pay $100 at most. 
* **Be direct and clear:** This establishes your position and leaves no room for ambiguity. 
* **Alice has incentive to negotiate:** She's already selling for less than her product's worth to her ($150)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's still $40 more than your maximum price.
* **You have a better option with John.** You can get the product for $100 from him without any further negotiation. 
* **Rejecting allows you to potentially get a better deal.** You can try to negotiate with Alice again, but there's no guarantee she'll go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase your offer slightly:** You're willing to pay a bit more than your initial offer, but still far less than Alice's last offer.
* **Show flexibility:** This demonstrates that you are willing to negotiate, increasing the chance of a deal. 
* **Still have a fallback option:** Remember, you can still buy the product from John for $100 if negotiations fail."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** It's $30 more than your maximum price.
* **You're close to a deal with John.** You can get the product for $100, which is much better than Alice's current offer.
* **Rejecting gives you time to see if Alice will come down further.**  You could potentially get a better deal, but it's risky."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increase the offer again:** You're slowly inching closer to Alice's price, but still maintaining a significant discount.
* **Show commitment to the deal:** This demonstrates your genuine interest in purchasing the product, making Alice more likely to negotiate.
* **Keep the fallback option in mind:** Remember that you can always buy from John for $100 if the negotiation fails."
