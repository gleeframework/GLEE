"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To meet you closer to your budget, I could let it go for $1,250,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer. While she might budge a little, it's unlikely she'll go as low as John's price of $1,200,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed option at your target price with John."
