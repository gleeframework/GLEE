""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, we want to see if Bob will pay a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

This offer aims to find a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a higher price and ensuring the sale doesn't fall through, leading us back to John's guaranteed offer."
