Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** It gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **It's a good first offer:** It shows you're open to negotiation, but you value your product.

If Bob rejects the offer, we'll need to consider his counteroffer and then decide if we want to accept, counter-offer, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. I've found another seller, John, who is willing to sell it to me for that amount. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm not going to accept $8,000 for a product I value at $10,000, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John. 

I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for this product.  Let's try to meet in the middle and make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $9,000, which is still above Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still not able to meet you at $9,000. Given the current market conditions and the value I place on this product, I believe $8,500 would be a fair compromise. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $9,000. I'll counter-offer again and see if we can reach a final agreement.  I'm still confident that I can get a better price, especially since I have John as a backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $8,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $8,750?  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
