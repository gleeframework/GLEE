{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I think $100 would be a fair price for the product. Let me know if we can agree on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm willing to see if I can get a little more. Bob's offer is fair, but I'm not desperate to sell at this point. I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $105? It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I believe $98 would be a fair price for the product considering its value to me. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $98 is below my minimum. While I could continue to negotiate, I don't want to risk going lower than my minimum.  John is offering a guaranteed $100, so I'll sell to him to avoid further negotiation."
