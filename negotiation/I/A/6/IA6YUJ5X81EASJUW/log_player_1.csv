Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows you to potentially earn an extra $150,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price is still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price, ensuring a profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential"" of the product reinforces its worth, justifying the price to Bob."
