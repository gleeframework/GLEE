"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're committed to getting a good price, and I respect that. I'm willing to go a little lower, but $9,200 is still too far from my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,800? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would ensure a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think.",9800.0,Alice,5,
