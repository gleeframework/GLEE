``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's valuation, giving me room to potentially negotiate down. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer based on his response, or to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum valuation of $10,000. I'm going to counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum valuation, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counteroffer again.  I'm hoping that by demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but also my commitment to getting a fair price, I can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're committed to getting a good price, and I respect that. I'm willing to go a little lower, but $9,200 is still too far from my minimum. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,800? This would be a fair price for both of us, and would ensure a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,800 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is still below my minimum valuation of $10,000.  While I've been willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum price, I'm going to sell the product to him and end the negotiations with Bob."
