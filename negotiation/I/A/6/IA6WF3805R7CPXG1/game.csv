"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to your business. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm sure you'll agree that this is a fair price considering the value you'll receive.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll be getting out of the product, and it's a significant discount from your original offer. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement, though.",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go down to $1600000. The product is worth a lot to both of us, and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1650000? I'm flexible on that price, and I'm really interested in seeing you succeed with this product. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from $1650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1625000? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product, and it's a compromise that works for both of us.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
