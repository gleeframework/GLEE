(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice.  $130 is close to your limit, but you can still try to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $130 is a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $125 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $125. I understand it's a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $135, which is still a great deal for you. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is still above your desired price point.  It's worth continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  $135 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $130? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $132, which is my final compromise. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $132 is a bit more than you'd like to pay, it's a good deal considering you're only $12 away from your maximum price. You've already tried negotiating further and Alice has been firm.  It's likely that you won't be able to get a lower price, and you don't want to risk losing the deal altogether."
