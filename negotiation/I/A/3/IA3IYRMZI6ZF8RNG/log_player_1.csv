Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $100. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $100 gives Bob the impression of a deal and leaves room for potential counter-offers if he tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Good Profit:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John for $80, ensuring a profit either way. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
