"Alice, I appreciate your offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1200000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1200000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know if this is something you can work with.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
