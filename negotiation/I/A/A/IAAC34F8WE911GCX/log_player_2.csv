"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your upper limit and Alice's value. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $120 is a bit high for my budget. Could you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and helps us understand Alice's lower bound.
* **Polite and Interested:**  The message aims to keep the negotiation collaborative. We acknowledge Alice's offer while expressing our price concerns.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By countering at $85, we're aiming slightly above Alice's product value ($80). This gives us some bargaining power while potentially securing a very good deal if Alice accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice moved closer to a middle ground, $100 is still significantly higher than her product value. We have leverage to negotiate further. 
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** By rejecting this offer, we're signaling to Alice that we're serious about a lower price. This helps us understand how much she's willing to come down.
* **Time Consideration:** We're still early in the negotiation process. We have time to make strategic counteroffers before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, I was hoping to spend closer to $90.  Would that price work for you?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:** We're moving in smaller increments now, signaling to Alice that we're getting closer to our target price. 
* **Direct but Respectful:** The message directly states our desired price range while maintaining a polite and respectful tone.
* **Targeting a Win-Win:**  $90 represents a good deal for both parties. Alice makes a decent profit, and we get the product well below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your target price, Bob. I can offer you the product for $95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $95 is a solid price, significantly lower than our maximum budget of $150 and a fair compromise from Alice's initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate for a slightly lower price risks Alice becoming frustrated or less willing to deal. We have a good offer on the table, and the potential savings of a few dollars might not be worth jeopardizing the deal.
* **Time Efficiency:**  We've successfully negotiated the price down in a reasonable number of rounds. Accepting now saves time and avoids potentially lengthy back-and-forth."
