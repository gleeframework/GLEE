"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit out of my range right now. I'm interested in the product but would need to come in a bit lower.  How about $7,500? ",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $8,500.  It's a fair price for a product this good.",8500.0,Bob,4,
