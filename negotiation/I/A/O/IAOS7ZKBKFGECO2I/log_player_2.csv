"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget. You want to save money, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit out of my range right now. I'm interested in the product but would need to come in a bit lower.  How about $7,500? "", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious interest in the product while still staying within your budget. It also leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point.  You want to try and get the price down further. Rejecting and counteroffering again will give you more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $8,500.  It's a fair price for a product this good."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a further step towards Alice's offer, showing that you're actively negotiating.  $8,500 is still within your budget and is a reasonable midpoint between your previous offer and Alice's current offer. This shows you are willing to compromise while still pushing for a good deal."
