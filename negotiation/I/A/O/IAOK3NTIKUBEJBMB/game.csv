"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My initial offer is $1,200,000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate the offer,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but not that much. How about $1,100,000? It's a fair price considering the value of this product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $950,000 is still a bit below where I need to be.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this one.  How about $1,025,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value and your willingness to negotiate. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
