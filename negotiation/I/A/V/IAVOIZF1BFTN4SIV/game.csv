"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,100,000 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still allows me to make a decent profit while giving you a good deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's try to close this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still hoping for a bit more. Let's meet in the middle at $1,212,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.  I'm confident we can close this deal with a little more effort.",1212500.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I'm getting a bit weary of this back and forth. My best and final offer is $1,190,000. If that doesn't work, I'll need to go with another option.",1190000.0,Bob,8,
