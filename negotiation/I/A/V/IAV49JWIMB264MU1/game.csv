"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $900,000, which is the lowest I can go. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is still a bit higher than your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I can do $880,000, which is the lowest I can go without losing money. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",880000.0,Alice,5,
