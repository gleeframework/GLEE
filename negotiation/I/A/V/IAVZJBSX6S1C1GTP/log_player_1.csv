Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to discussing this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $800,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget constraints.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.
