"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer in its field. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm very interested in this product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $800000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1000000. This is a competitive price for a product of this caliber, and I believe it's a fair reflection of its value. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're confident in the product's value, but $1000000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's find a middle ground.  I'm prepared to offer $900000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget constraints.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm thinking of $1050000. This is a fair price for a product of this quality, and I believe it's worth considering. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
