"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, it's still above your target of saving as much money as possible. It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from $120, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about $95?  That gives us both a little room to work with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is within my acceptable price range. It's only $5 more than my counteroffer, and it's still a good deal compared to buying from John. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product without risking further negotiation or losing the opportunity to John."
