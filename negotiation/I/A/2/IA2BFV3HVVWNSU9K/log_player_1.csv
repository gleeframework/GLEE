Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $14,000 is higher than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $14,000 is above your minimum of $15,000, ensuring you still make a profit. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** There's still space for negotiation, allowing you to potentially reach a price closer to your desired amount.

Remember, this is just the first offer. You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,500? I'm serious about buying this product, but that's the most I can afford right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While he's shown interest, accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for you.  It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a better price before selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob. Since his offer is too low, consider a counteroffer closer to your initial offer of $14,000 or slightly lower. You could try:

* **$13,500:** This is a compromise, showing you're willing to negotiate but still maintaining a decent profit.
* **$13,000:**  If you're feeling more aggressive, you could try a slightly lower counteroffer.

Remember, the key is to find a balance between getting the best price and not risking losing Bob as a buyer altogether."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,500 is significantly lower than what I need to accept.  To make this work for both of us, how about $13,000?  It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to move forward with the sale. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Reasoning:**  The message emphasizes the value proposition for Bob while highlighting the need for a higher price for you.
* **Flexibility:**  $13,000 leaves room for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer balances your need for a good price with the potential risk of losing Bob entirely. It allows for a potential agreement while maintaining your position as a seller who values a fair deal."
