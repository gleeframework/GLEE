"Alice,  $1,600,000 is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm  initially offering $1,000,000 for the product. This is my maximum budget, but I am open to discussing a slight adjustment if you are willing to negotiate.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is a significant gap from my position.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true value of the product.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,450,000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
