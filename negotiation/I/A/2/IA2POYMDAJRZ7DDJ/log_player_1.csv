Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, it's always beneficial to try and get a higher price.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 creates a significant profit margin for me while still providing a potential $300,000 value proposition for Bob.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning the offer's exclusivity and limited time frame, I aim to encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob."
