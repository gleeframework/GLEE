Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a bold move, but it allows for potential negotiation and leaves room for compromise.
* **Knowing my Bottom Line:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,000,000, so I have a solid floor to my negotiations.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** I don't know what Bob's perceived value is, so by starting high, I can gauge his interest and potentially get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, great! I've successfully sold the product.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and consider his perceived value.  I will adjust my counteroffers based on his responses, aiming to maximize my profit while keeping in mind my bottom line of $1,000,000.
* **John as a Safety Net:** If negotiations with Bob become unproductive, I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 to ensure I don't lose out on the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Still High:**  While $1,200,000 is less than my initial offer, it's still a good price, and I can likely get closer to my desired range through further negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the door open to potentially reaching a higher price. 
* **Evaluating Bob's Value:** Bob's counteroffer gives me valuable insight into his perceived value of the product.

**Next Steps:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll propose a counteroffer that's closer to $1,200,000 but still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Tactics:** I'll use strategic language to justify my counteroffer and emphasize the value of the product.
* **Monitoring Progress:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's responses and adjust my approach accordingly to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving Closer to Bob's Offer:** I'm lowering my price from the initial $1,500,000 to $1,350,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a compromise.
* **Strategic Gap:** This counteroffer leaves a $150,000 gap between my offer and Bob's, which gives us both room to negotiate further.
* **Maintaining my Position:** While lowering my price, I'm still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This ensures I'm not giving away too much profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:** I'll closely monitor Bob's reaction to my counteroffer.
* **Flexibility is Key:**  Depending on his response, I'll adjust my strategy for subsequent rounds, potentially lowering my price further or holding firm on my current position.
* **John's Offer as a Backstop:** I will keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."

**Explanation:**

**Next Steps:**
