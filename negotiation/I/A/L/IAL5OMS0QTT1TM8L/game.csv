"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and still allows me a good profit.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the price, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? It's still a great deal for you, and I can still make a decent profit. Let's make this happen!",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,750 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $10,000?  That's a fair price for the product and still allows you a good profit. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
