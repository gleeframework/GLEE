"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and still allows me a good profit.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can likely get a better deal than $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially save even more money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? It's still a great deal for you, and I can still make a decent profit. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750

You can still get the product for less than $10,750. Rejecting this offer and counteroffering again will likely get you closer to your ideal price."
