"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to meet you halfway, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. How about $135? This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a great product.",135.0,Alice,3,
