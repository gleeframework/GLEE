{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below what I know the product is worth to Bob, but high enough that I still make a decent profit. I'm also trying to be friendly and positive in my message to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $130 is still a good profit for me, I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm happy to meet you halfway, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. How about $135? This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a great product."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $130. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $135, Bob's offer is still a good profit for me.  It's also close enough to my desired price that I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
