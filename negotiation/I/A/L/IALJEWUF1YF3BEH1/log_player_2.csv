You can likely get the product for a lower price by counter-offering.  Since it's worth $10,000 to you, there's room to negotiate."

The product is worth $10,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $10,500. It's a good deal to accept, especially since you could always buy from John for $10,000 later."
