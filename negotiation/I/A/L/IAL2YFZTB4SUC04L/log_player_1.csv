"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer starts at a price point that is closer to my value of $120, but is still potentially attractive to Bob as it is less than his perceived value of $80.  This leaves room for potential negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest before resorting to the alternative buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it is significantly below my minimum value of $120.  I will counter with a price closer to my desired range to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your offer.  $60 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $80?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 80}
``` 
 
This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting halfway between my minimum value of $120 and Bob's offer of $60.  It shows a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent price for the product."
