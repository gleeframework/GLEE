Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for concessions and makes it more likely to reach an agreement closer to your target.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback position. You can afford to be more firm in negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer represents his maximum budget, accepting it would mean a significant loss for you ($200,000 below your minimum). It's worth engaging in further negotiation to explore if a more favorable agreement can be reached. You have a strong alternative with John, giving you leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While that's a significant difference from my initial asking price, I'm willing to move down to $1,100,000. I believe this product's value will far exceed that for your needs."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:** This counteroffer shows Bob you're serious about making a deal while still staying well above his initial offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reinforces the product's value proposition, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This counteroffer leaves space for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant, but also keeps you within a reasonable range of your target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still just a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? It's a good midpoint, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Compromise:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a reasonable compromise. While it's still below your ideal price, it's significantly closer than his initial offer and only $150,000 less than your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing negotiations prolongs the sale and delays receiving payment. Accepting now secures a significant sum without further uncertainty. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting a reasonable offer demonstrates goodwill and could lead to future business opportunities with Bob."
