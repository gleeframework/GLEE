"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While that's a significant difference from my initial asking price, I'm willing to move down to $1,100,000. I believe this product's value will far exceed that for your needs.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still just a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? It's a good midpoint, and I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
