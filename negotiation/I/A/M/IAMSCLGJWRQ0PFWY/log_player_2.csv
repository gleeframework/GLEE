"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great opportunity for you to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my budget of $8,000. It's worthwhile to reject the offer and explore negotiating a better price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,500 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'll continue negotiating to try and get a better price, as I still have the option to buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $8,500.  If you're not able to come down to that price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8500 and $11000, which is $9750. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your best offer being $8500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $9500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $9,500 is still higher than my ideal price.  While it's a good deal, it's still significantly higher than the $8,000 I can get from John.  I've reached my limit for negotiation, and it's time to take the more cost-effective option."
