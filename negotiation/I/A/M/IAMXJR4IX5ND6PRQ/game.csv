"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $175. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for offering this product! I'm interested, but $175 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $120. This is still a good deal for you, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we split the difference between your offer and mine - would you be willing to do $100?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but $100 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $125. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $150. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
