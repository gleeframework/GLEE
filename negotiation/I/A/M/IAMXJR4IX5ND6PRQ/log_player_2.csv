Alice's offer:

I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $125. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $150.

Alice is unlikely to go below $125, and we know we can get the product for $100 from John.  It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed good deal."
