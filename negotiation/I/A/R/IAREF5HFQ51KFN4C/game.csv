"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1,200,000. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to drop that low yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a successful deal for both of us.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,125,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,062,500. Can we get closer to a deal?",1062500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you. Let's try $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,087,500. I'm hoping we can get closer to a deal.",1087500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob,  I see we're both committed to finding a price that works. I'm going to go a little lower this time and offer $1,093,750. This shows my willingness to meet you halfway. Let's seal the deal this round.",1093750.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,093,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,082,500. I'm hoping we can finally reach a deal.",1082500.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, we're almost there. Let's try $1,087,500. This is a small compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price that works for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1087500.0,Alice,9,
