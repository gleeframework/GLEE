"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Could we work with a price closer to $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the substantial benefits it offers you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
