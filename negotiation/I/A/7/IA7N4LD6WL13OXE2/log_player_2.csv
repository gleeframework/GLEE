"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While $140 is a better price than $150, it's still above your maximum budget of $150. You can get the product from John for the same price, so it's better to reject Alice's offer."
