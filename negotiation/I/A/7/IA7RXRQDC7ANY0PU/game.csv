"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, $20,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",15500.0,Bob,4,
