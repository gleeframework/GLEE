Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he negotiates, you know he's interested but wants a better deal. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob."
