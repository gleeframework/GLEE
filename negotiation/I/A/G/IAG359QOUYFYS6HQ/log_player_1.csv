Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a significant amount, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you and my need to get a reasonable return. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing him and ending up with John's offer, which is less.  $825,000 is a good outcome."
