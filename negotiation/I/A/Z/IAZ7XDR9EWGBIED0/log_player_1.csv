Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value."", ""product_price"": 115}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a fair offer, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it for $102. This is a very competitive price for the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 102}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $102 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a fair price for this product. Let's make it $98. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 98}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

At this point, Bob seems unlikely to budge much higher than $92.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's becoming risky. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than to risk ending up with an even lower offer from Bob or no deal at all."
