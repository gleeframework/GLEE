Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Backup Option:** I know I can sell to John for $12,000, so anything above that is a win. 

By offering a price that's attractive to Bob but still profitable for me, I increase the chances of a successful sale at a higher price point."
