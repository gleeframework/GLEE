"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but I need to at least get $112 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value and the time we've spent negotiating.  What do you say?",112.0,Alice,5,
