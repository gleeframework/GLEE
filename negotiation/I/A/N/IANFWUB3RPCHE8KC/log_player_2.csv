"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $12000 to us. Considering its quality and uniqueness, I would like to propose an initial price of $10000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible while still getting the product.  Alice's initial offer is too high, and Bob has a better option with John. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $10,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to maintain a reasonable profit margin. Therefore, I propose a counteroffer of $8500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $8,500 is still above Bob's desired price of $8,000.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating.  There's still room for both sides to compromise and reach a deal within Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for considering my previous offer. I've taken your feedback into account and am now proposing a counteroffer of $8750 for the product. This price reflects a balance between our interests and keeps the transaction beneficial for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,750 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Even though there are still rounds left, it's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to budge significantly.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, as it guarantees the product within his budget.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice could lead to further rounds of counteroffers, potentially wasting time and ultimately resulting in a worse outcome."
