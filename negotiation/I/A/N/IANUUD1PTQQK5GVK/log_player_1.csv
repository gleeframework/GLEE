{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Confident Positioning:**  The message frames the offer as valuable and exclusive, subtly encouraging Bob to act quickly.

By offering the product at $1,300,000, we aim to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob to accept."
