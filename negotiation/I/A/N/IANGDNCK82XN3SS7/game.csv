"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $12,000?  That's the top of my budget for this product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",13500.0,Alice,5,
