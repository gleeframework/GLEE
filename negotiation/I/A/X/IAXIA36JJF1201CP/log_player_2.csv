"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price of $12,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal.  It's worth exploring further negotiation before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which reflects its value to me. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer of $9,250 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While there's a chance Bob could continue negotiating and get a lower price, it's not guaranteed. Given the option to buy from John for $8,000, Bob is better off securing the product at this price and avoiding further negotiation. This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice."
