"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further.  You have the advantage of knowing you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so you have room to push for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down to $950,000, but I'm really trying to stay under $900,000 for this. Would you consider dropping the price to $875,000?"", ""product_price"": 875000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $912500. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but she's still above your desired price point. You're still in a good position to negotiate further, knowing you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  There's still room to push for a lower price without risking losing the deal completely."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not comfortable going all the way down to $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest request. I'll offer the product to you for $907500. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $907,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $907,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $907,500, which is very close to your desired price point of $900,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk is that Alice will walk away or stick to her current price. At this point, it's a good deal for you, as you're getting the product for less than what John is selling it for.  Accepting the offer minimizes the risk and secures a good price."
