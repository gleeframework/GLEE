Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round. $1,400,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,200,000, and I'm hoping to secure a better price."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1600000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1550000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,550,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to reject this offer and counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer to a deal.  While I appreciate your offer,  I'm still not quite there.  Let's try $1,580,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1580000. I'm willing to go up to $1575000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.

At this point, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum, and I'm running out of rounds.  It's better to secure a sale at $1,575,000 than risk getting nothing and having to sell to John for $1,200,000."
