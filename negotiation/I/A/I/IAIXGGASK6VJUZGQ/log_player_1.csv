Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counter offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm confident you'll find this product well worth the price."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to go up to $110, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. Can we meet at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $110 is a good deal. It's significantly more than my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
