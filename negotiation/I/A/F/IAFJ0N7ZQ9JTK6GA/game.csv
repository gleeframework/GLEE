"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $100. I think it's worth more than that. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit on this product.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, Alice. How about we settle at $105? That's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I think it's worth more than that. How about we go up to $110? I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I need to make a profit on this product.",110.0,Alice,5,
