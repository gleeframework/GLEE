"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product, which has been meticulously designed and engineered to revolutionize its industry. With its cutting-edge technology and unparalleled features, it's not just a product; it's a game-changer. Given its exceptional quality and the unique benefits it offers, I believe it's worth more than $800000. However, I understand that value is subjective and varies from person to person. Therefore, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product for $1200000. This generous offer is valid for a limited time, and I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's discuss how we can make this extraordinary product a part of your business or personal endeavors. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
