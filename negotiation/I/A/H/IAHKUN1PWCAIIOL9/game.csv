"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm looking to sell it to you for $200. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you won't find anywhere else, and I'm willing to let it go for this price. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120?",120.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $180. This is my best price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",180.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice. However, $180 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150?",150.0,Bob,4,
