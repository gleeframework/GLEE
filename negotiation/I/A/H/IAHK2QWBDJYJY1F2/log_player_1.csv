Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. $900,000 is still a bit low, but I want to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, and I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be.  I'm going to meet you halfway and offer $975,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
