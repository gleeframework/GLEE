"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm really looking to get this product for as close to my budget as possible.  How about $720,000?  That would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a great investment.",720000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get the product for as close to your budget as possible. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $720,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $765,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",765000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $765,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go to $740,000.  This would be a significant savings for me and I believe we could close the deal quickly. Let's make this happen.",740000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $740,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $755,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",755000.0,Alice,5,
