"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",15500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16,750. Is this more to your liking?",16750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $16,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $16,250, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Is this a price you'd be willing to pay?",16250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,125?  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",16125.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $16,125, but I'd like to add a small premium for the hassle of negotiating with you. Let's say $16,175. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",16175.0,Alice,7,
