Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob.  I know he values the product at $1,200,000, so this leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we both feel we got a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's closer to what I'm looking for. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at $1,400,000, which is still below my ideal price but is closer to my minimum of $1,500,000. I'm willing to accept this offer as it's a good deal and prevents me from having to negotiate further."
