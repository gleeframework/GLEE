"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential deal while maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we discuss a price of $9800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,800 is getting closer, it's still not close enough to my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to budge further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,800 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $10200 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to pay $9900, as I mentioned before. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not comfortable with $9,900, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to make a profit from this sale.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is closer to your offer and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  This is my final offer. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $10000 is a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a fair deal for me. My next offer is $9500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are running out of time, and Bob seems unwilling to budge much further.  While I'd like to get closer to my target price, $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  To ensure I get a good deal, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000."
