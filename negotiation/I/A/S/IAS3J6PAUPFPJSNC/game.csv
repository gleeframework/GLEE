"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $10,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? I'm really looking for a good deal here.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,250 is closer, but still a bit more than I can comfortably afford right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,800?  This is a price that's fair for both of us and gets the deal done.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $8,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",9000.0,Alice,5,
