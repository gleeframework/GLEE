{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going all-in immediately, giving Bob the opportunity to counter. This helps to avoid a quick rejection and keeps the negotiation going.
* **John as a safety net:** I'm mindful that I have a guaranteed alternative with John, which gives me leverage. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still make a significant profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob already showed he's interested and willing to pay more than his initial $800,000 estimate. 
* **John is still a viable option:**  Selling to John guarantees a much higher price, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer just yet.

I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that allows me to get a good return on my investment while still giving you a valuable asset. Let's find common ground here! "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise.
* **Still above my minimum:** The price is still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving in completely. I still have John as a backup option, reminding Bob that I have leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a good return, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to still make a decent profit.  Let's aim for a deal that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **John is still a better option:** Selling to John guarantees me a much higher price, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer just yet.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob if I continue negotiating.  

I'll counter Bob's offer once again and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000. This is a reasonable price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising further:** I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's offer, showing my willingness to find common ground.
* **Still above my minimum:** While lower than my previous offer, it's still comfortably above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Creating urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the need for a mutually beneficial agreement,  putting a bit of pressure on Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

Let's see if this counteroffer will finally convince Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  Let's close this deal and finalize it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still not enough.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob's offer is tempting, there's a chance we could get closer to my target price with continued negotiations.
* **Time is money:**  However, the negotiation has gone on for a few rounds, and I'm starting to worry about wasting time. 
* **John is the safe bet:** Selling to John guarantees me a significantly higher price, and it's becoming clear that getting a better price from Bob might be too time-consuming.

I've decided to take the guaranteed higher price from John. It's a decision that ensures my financial goals are met, even if it means passing on a potential deal with Bob."
