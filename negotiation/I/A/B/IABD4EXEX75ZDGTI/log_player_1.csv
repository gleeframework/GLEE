"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is lower than my minimum value but still leaves room for potential profit. It's also a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I still have 9 rounds left, and selling to John is a safety net if the negotiations don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my value."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
