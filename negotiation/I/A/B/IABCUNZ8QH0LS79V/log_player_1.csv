I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $120 because it's too low. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price of $150 in the next rounds."

I've been trying to negotiate with Bob for a few rounds now, but it seems we're not going to reach a price that works for both of us.  I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm not sure he'll budge much further. Since I'm not confident we'll reach a deal, I'm going to go with the guaranteed sale to John.  I'll make more money that way."
