"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that you're interested in. My starting price is $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $11,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open communication:**  I'm starting with a friendly message to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Room for counteroffers:**  This opening price leaves room for Bob to counter, which is essential for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's also too far below my initial offer of $11,500.  While it's tempting to accept a quick sale, I'm confident I can negotiate a better price.  I'll counter and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both compromise a bit."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial counter.  
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** I'm emphasizing a desire to reach a compromise, which could encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price. 
* **Stay above minimum:** My counteroffer remains above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about $9,750?  That's a significant move on my end, and it gets us much closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation. I'll counter with an offer that's slightly higher than Bob's, keeping in mind that I have John as a backup buyer if this doesn't work out.  I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your price.  However, $9,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference at $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Focus on fairness:** I'm emphasizing the concept of fairness to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Splitting the difference:**  Offering a price that's the midpoint between our previous offers can signal a willingness to compromise and make it easier for Bob to agree.
* **Moving towards a deal:** This offer moves us closer to a potential deal, but it still allows for further negotiation if necessary."
