"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we both compromise a bit.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about $9,750?  That's a significant move on my end, and it gets us much closer to a deal.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your price.  However, $9,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference at $10,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done.",10000.0,Alice,5,
