"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:** It's important to make a strong counteroffer that leaves room for negotiation but also signals my budget limitations. 
* **Respectful but Firm:**  The message is framed positively, acknowledging the product's value while firmly stating my price point.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, I'm aiming to bring the negotiation closer to my desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value of this product is significantly higher.  Would you consider $1,200,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice decreased her price, but it's still too high. We have room to negotiate further down towards John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Could we settle at $900,000? I feel that's a fair price that reflects the value while fitting within my budget."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving closer to Alice's price, but in smaller increments to show we're willing to negotiate while still seeking a significant discount.
* **Justification and Compromise:** The message re-emphasizes our budget limitations while proposing a price that splits the difference between our last offer and Alice's current one. 
* **Sense of Urgency (Subtle):** By saying ""settle at,"" there's a subtle implication that we're getting closer to a point where a decision needs to be made, encouraging Alice to consider the offer seriously."
