"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me.  This product would need to be significantly cheaper for me to consider it. How about $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $8,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I could go up to $9,500.  What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to give you a small discount, though. How about we meet at $11,500? It's still a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, I can't justify going over $10,000 for this product. If you're willing to come down to that, we have a deal.",10000.0,Bob,6,
