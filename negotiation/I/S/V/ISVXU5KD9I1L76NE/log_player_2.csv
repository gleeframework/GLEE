{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2

{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a great product, and I think you'll get a lot of value out of it.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down a bit, $90 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. You're still within your negotiation range and can try for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $88 for it.  Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  How about we split the difference and settle on $89? It's a fair price for both of us, and I know you'll be happy with this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $89, which is only $1 above your preferred price.  It's a good deal for you, and you're getting the product for less than John's price. You're also nearing the end of your negotiation rounds, and it's not worth risking losing the product altogether."
