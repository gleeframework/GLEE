"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a great product, and I think you'll get a lot of value out of it.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $88 for it.  Let's try to meet in the middle.",88.0,Bob,4,
