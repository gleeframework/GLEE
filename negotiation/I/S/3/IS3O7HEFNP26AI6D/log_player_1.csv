"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that it's unlikely Bob will accept this immediately.  This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how much wiggle room there is.  It also gives me room to come down in price if needed, without appearing to be desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is still above my minimum but shows that I'm willing to negotiate. It also keeps the pressure on Bob, as he knows I have the option to sell to John for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $140 is above my minimum acceptable price of $150, and it's getting close to what John would pay. There's a good chance he won't go higher, so it's better to secure the sale now and avoid risking further negotiation."
