"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 isn't quite what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my asking price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? That's as high as I'm willing to go.,107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's compromise at $109. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $108 is still a bit lower than I'm aiming for.  Let's split the difference once more and go with $108.50.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make.",108.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
I'm not willing to go above $108. I think that's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at that price.,108.0,Bob,8,
