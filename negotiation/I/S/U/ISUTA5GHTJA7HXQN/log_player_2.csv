**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While buying from John for $15,000 is an option, accepting Alice's offer of $14,000 saves Bob $1,000. Even though the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, the offer is still within Bob's budget and allows him to save money compared to buying from John."
