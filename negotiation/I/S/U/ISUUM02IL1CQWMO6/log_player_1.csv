Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel good about potentially buying the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This initial offer allows for a back-and-forth, giving me the chance to adjust my price if Bob counteroffers.
* **Protecting My Minimum:** The offer is above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, so I'm not giving away value too quickly. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $7,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and even below my initial offer of $9,500. Accepting it would mean a significant loss for me.
* **John is a better option:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $10,000.  There's no need to settle for a much lower price from Bob.
* **Room for counteroffers:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and try to get a price closer to my desired range.  This also shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $7,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but staying in the negotiation to try and find a middle ground.
* **Moving Closer:**  My counteroffer of $8,500 is significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to try and justify the price.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money. 
* **Negotiation:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my budget, Alice. How about $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is moving closer to my minimum, $7,750 is still significantly below my desired price.
* **John is the safer option:**  John's offer of $10,000 is a guaranteed sale and ensures I don't have to compromise on my minimum.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, and rejecting his offer keeps the door open for potential further counteroffers. I might be able to get closer to my desired price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $7,750 is still a bit low.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This price reflects the product's value and leaves some room for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering Again:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but continuing to negotiate.
* **Moving Closer (But Slowly):** I'm reducing my price again, but only by a small amount ($250). This shows flexibility without drastically lowering my value.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the price.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** My offer is still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Keeping Negotiation Open:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive, hoping to find a mutually agreeable price without resorting to John's offer."
