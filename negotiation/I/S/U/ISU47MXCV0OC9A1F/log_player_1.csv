"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000.  This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects it.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his perceived value of the product is."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Unfortunately, Bob's offer is below my minimum, and I've already made my final counteroffer.  I can't afford to go any lower.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  It's not ideal, but it's the best I can do at this point."
