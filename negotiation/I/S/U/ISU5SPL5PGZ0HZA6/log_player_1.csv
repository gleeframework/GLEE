{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum price. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me some profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This offer allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, giving me the opportunity to gauge Bob's interest and potentially find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm aware that John is a potential buyer at my minimum price, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates that he is interested in the product. This opens the door for further negotiation.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.  This gives me the chance to find a middle ground and potentially secure a better price than $9,000.
* **John's Offer as a Backup:**  I have John's offer of $15,000 as a safety net, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's low offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great value."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the conversation amicable.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing that the price is fair for both parties.
* **Maintaining Margin:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum price of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.

This counteroffer presents a reasonable compromise while still allowing room for further negotiation if needed. It demonstrates my willingness to find a solution that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my minimum acceptable price, $9,500 is still below my desired margin and leaves me feeling like I'm selling the product for less than it's worth.
* **Potential for a Higher Counteroffer:** I believe I can push for a better price. Bob is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate, suggesting there's still room for a mutually acceptable offer.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer because I have John's offer of $15,000 as a fallback option.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a final counteroffer closer to my desired price, potentially securing a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for you.  Let me know if this is something you're interested in."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This counteroffer is a final compromise, moving closer to Bob's last offer while still ensuring I receive a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to emphasize the fairness of the offer.
* **Direct and Clear:** I'm being direct and clear about my final offer, leaving no room for further ambiguity.
* **Closing the Deal:** This offer is designed to encourage Bob to accept and close the deal, avoiding further back-and-forth negotiations. 

While $10,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward while minimizing the risk of losing the sale to John."
