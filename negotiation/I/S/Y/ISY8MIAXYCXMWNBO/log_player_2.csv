"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal compared to John's $150 price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice. You are willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's minimum is likely around $80. There's room for negotiation to find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, showing your willingness to negotiate. It's also well above Alice's minimum value, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer, and still higher than your counteroffer, indicating a potential meeting point.  You are willing to pay up to $150, so $110 is a good deal compared to buying from John.  Accepting Alice's offer saves you money and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
