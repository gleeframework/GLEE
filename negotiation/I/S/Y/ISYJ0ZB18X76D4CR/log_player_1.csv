"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $700,000 is too far below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This gives you a great deal, and still allows me to get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about $775,000? That's a significant step from my previous offer and puts us closer to a potential agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $800,000 right now. I'll try to get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, let's keep moving towards a deal. $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000.  That's a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be frank, $825,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a good deal for me. Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum, and I'm happy to accept it."
