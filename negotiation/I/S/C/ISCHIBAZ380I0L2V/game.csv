"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $900000 is closer to what you're hoping for, it's still below what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price is a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this transaction.  Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're still looking for a lower price.  While I'm always willing to compromise,  $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $925000 is simply not a price that works for me. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm also committed to achieving a fair deal. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $975000. This compromise allows us both to benefit from this transaction while respecting each other's needs.
