"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but my original price was carefully considered based on the product's true worth. How about we meet halfway at $1,200,000? This demonstrates significant movement on my end while recognizing the value you see in the product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original counteroffer, so I'll offer $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $1,050,000 undervalues the product significantly. You mentioned a 'target price,' suggesting there might be some flexibility. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a substantial concession from my initial offer and reflects my strong desire to close this deal with you.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,150,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your latest offer, so I'll offer $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
