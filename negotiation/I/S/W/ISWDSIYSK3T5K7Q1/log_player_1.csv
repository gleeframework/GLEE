Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
