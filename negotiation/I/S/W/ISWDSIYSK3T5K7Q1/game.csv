"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth more than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,050,000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
