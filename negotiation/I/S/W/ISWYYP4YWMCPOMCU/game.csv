"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to make a deal, but $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $1100000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a good deal, but $950000 is getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is my final offer, so if you're interested, let me know now!",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and my original offer of $900000, which is $975000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is my last offer, so please let me know if you're interested.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Bob, I think we're getting close, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1075000. I'm actually starting to think that selling to you might not be the best option for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1075000 and $1025000, but I need to get a bit more than that. I'm counteroffering at $1075000",1075000.0,Alice,9,

"Hi Alice, I'm not willing to pay $1075000. I'm making one last offer: $1025000. If you're not willing to accept this price, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away and buy the product from John for $1500000. Please let me know your final decision.",1025000.0,Bob,10,
