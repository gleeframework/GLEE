"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. I believe it's a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll love it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on it and the value you place on it.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.  This gives us both a good deal, and allows me to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $14,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on it and the value you place on it.",15500.0,Alice,5,
