"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. I believe it's a fair compromise and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer you $12,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you place on it."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on it and the value you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still too high.  While it's a compromise, it's still above my maximum budget. I will continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.  This gives us both a good deal, and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $14,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value I place on it and the value you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  I've already made multiple counteroffers and it seems like we're not going to reach a mutually acceptable price.  It's better to buy the product from John for $10,000 and save myself the time and hassle of further negotiation."
