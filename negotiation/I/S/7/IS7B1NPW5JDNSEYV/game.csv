"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I believe a price of $22,000 is fair. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000 for a product like this. Would you consider an offer in that range?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10,000 significantly undervalues this product and its capabilities.  I'm willing to come down to $19,000.  This offer reflects the true value of what you're getting.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $19,000 is still a bit high for my budget, I'm willing to increase my offer to $12,000.  I believe this is a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming to find a price point that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and reflects my commitment to getting this deal done.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, to be honest, $16,000 is still pushing my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,000? I feel that's a reasonable compromise.",13000.0,Bob,6,
