{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($100).  There's room for negotiation, making it worthwhile to reject the initial offer and see if a lower price can be reached."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $100. A counteroffer of $105 represents a significant price reduction from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $125 is higher than Bob's ideal price, but still within his budget. However, Bob is determined to save as much money as possible.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

```

**Explanation:**

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $135 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price and the negotiations are getting close to the end. There are still 3 rounds left to negotiate a lower price. By rejecting this offer, Bob shows he's still determined to get the best possible price.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a tough decision for Bob.  While $140 is still within his budget, it's close to the price John is offering ($150).  However, there's only one round left and Alice has shown she's not willing to budge much further.  It's likely that Alice's final offer will be even higher than $140, and with no room for further negotiation, buying from John is the more predictable option.  It guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget."
