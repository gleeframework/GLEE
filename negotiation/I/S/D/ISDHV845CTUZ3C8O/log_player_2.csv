"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but you can likely do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and gives me room to compromise later on.  Let's see what Alice says!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still trying to get a lower price. While $850,000 is closer to my target, I'll see if I can negotiate further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get Alice to agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $800,000, which is a good price and closer to my target.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my offer, and then I might be forced to buy from John for a much higher price. It's better to take this offer and secure the deal."
