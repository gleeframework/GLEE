Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for a special price of $119. I know you'll find it valuable."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 
 
Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:**  You aim to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a slight chance for Bob to counter-offer, potentially getting you even closer to his maximum.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** If Bob rejects your offer, you still have John as a reliable backup who will pay your minimum acceptable price of $100."
