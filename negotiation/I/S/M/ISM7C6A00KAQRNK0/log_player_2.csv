"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us. It's a significant discount from what I'd get from another buyer, and it's still above your estimated value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,000,000
* **Your Maximum:** $800,000
* **John's Offer:** $800,000

While Alice's offer is a discount for her, it's still $200,000 more than what you're willing to pay and what John offers.  You can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
