Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,150,000.  I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher final price.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob gives you leverage.  A price of $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal while still netting you a significant profit.
* **Alternative Option:**  You always have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000. This provides a safety net and prevents you from feeling pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is good, we're still aiming for the best possible deal. We started high, and he's showing willingness to negotiate.  There's room to meet in the middle and potentially get closer to $1,125,000. We'll counter-offer to test the waters further before accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,100,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?"",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can help move the negotiation towards a close.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $1,125,000 ensures you're still making a significant profit above your $1,000,000 minimum and John's offer.
* **Testing Bob's Limit:** This counteroffer will help gauge how much further Bob is willing to go and whether a deal closer to $1,150,000 is attainable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to John's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is now getting close to John's standing offer of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate aggressively risks losing Bob entirely. He might completely walk away, leaving us to accept John's lower offer. 
* **Reasonable Profit:** While not ideal, $1,075,000 is still a good profit above our minimum. It's better to secure a decent deal now than risk getting nothing extra."
