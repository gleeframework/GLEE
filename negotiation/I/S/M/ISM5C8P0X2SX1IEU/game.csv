"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,500. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above $9,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $9,500 is too low, so I will offer $10,250. This is my final compromise",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final compromise, but it's a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750.  This is my final offer.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. I'm still at $10,250. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle after all. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price",10250.0,Alice,7,
