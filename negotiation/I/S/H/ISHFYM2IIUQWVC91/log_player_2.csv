"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $90.  Since the product is worth $80 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  You should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit.  It's also below your maximum price of $100, so you're still getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is closer to your maximum price, but still higher than your ideal price. You can likely get a lower price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by coming down from $90 to $92.  This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, but still well below Alice's current price, indicating you are willing to negotiate but are firm on wanting a good price.  It also keeps you comfortably below your $100 threshold."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, but she's still too high. You have several rounds left and should continue negotiating for a lower price. You're still comfortably below your maximum price with John, so there's no need to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 89} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but she's still not at your ideal price. By offering $89, you're showing that you're serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate. This offer is still comfortably below your maximum price of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price has gone up again to $95.  You're now at the midpoint of the negotiation, with only 3 rounds remaining. This suggests that Alice might be reluctant to go lower.  Since John is offering the product for $100, it's no longer worth it to continue negotiating with Alice.  Buying from John ensures you get the product while still staying within your budget."
