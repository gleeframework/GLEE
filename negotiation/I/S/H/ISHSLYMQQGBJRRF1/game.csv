"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  Could we settle at $775,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $775,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm offering a counteroffer of $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a good value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
