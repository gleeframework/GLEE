Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135.  I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it at a fair price.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $135. This is higher than Bob's valuation of $120, but it's still lower than my minimum value of $150.
* **Message:** I'm trying to be persuasive and highlight the value to Bob while also suggesting the price is fair. 

**Reasoning:**

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings. I'm hoping to strike a deal with Bob, but if he rejects the offer, I can fall back on selling to John for my minimum value. By offering a price slightly lower than my minimum, I increase the likelihood that Bob will accept the offer, potentially earning me more than selling to John."
