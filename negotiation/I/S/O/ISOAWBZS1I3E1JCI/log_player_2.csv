"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's aiming for a price of $8,000 and Alice is starting at $11,000. There's room for negotiation, and it's likely Alice will come down in price if Bob pushes back."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering you a price of $10,500. It's a fair middle ground, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still aiming for a price of $8,000 and Alice is at $10,500. While this is closer, there's still room for negotiation. He should continue to push for a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $10,500 is still a bit above what I can afford. I'm hoping we can find a price closer to $9,000. Maybe we can meet in the middle at $9,500?"", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm thinking of offering you a price of $10,200. It's still a good compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He's still aiming for a price of $8,000 and Alice is at $10,200.  While it's getting closer, he can still push for a lower price. There's no reason for him to settle for anything more than $9,000 at this point."

Round 6

{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $10,200 is still above my budget. Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'm willing to go up to $9,700.  That's a fair compromise, and hopefully, we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9700}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's still aiming for a price of $8,000 and Alice is at $10,000. While this is getting closer, there's still room for negotiation.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 9800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,800. I'm thinking of offering you a price of $9,900. It's still a good compromise, considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  He's only one round away from having to make a decision, and Alice is still offering $9,900.  It's unlikely that he'll be able to negotiate her down to his target price of $8,000 in one round.  He's better off buying from John and saving himself the potential hassle of further negotiation."
