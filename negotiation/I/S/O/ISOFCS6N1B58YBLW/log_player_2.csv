{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my maximum budget. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
