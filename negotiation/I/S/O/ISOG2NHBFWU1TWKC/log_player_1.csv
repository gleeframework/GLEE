Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Value:**  The product is worth $15,000 to me. 
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $8,000 to Bob. 
* **John's Value:** John is willing to pay $15,000.

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Bob $14,000. This is a price that is:

* **Higher than Bob's value:**  He gets a better deal than if he doesn't buy. 
* **Lower than my value:** I still get a good price for the product, and it's better than selling to John.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I earn $14,000.
* **If Bob rejects:** I can sell to John for $15,000. 

This strategy maximizes my chances of getting a good price while still leaving room for a potential deal with Bob."
