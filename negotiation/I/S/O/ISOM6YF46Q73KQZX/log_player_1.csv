"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is higher than the $8,000 Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $12,000 is still above your minimum of $15,000, giving you room to negotiate downwards if needed. 

By starting a bit high, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially get closer to your desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is more than Bob's initial assessment of $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have 10 rounds to work with, and selling to John guarantees me my minimum.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.  The $10,500 figure is a compromise, signaling my willingness to negotiate while also holding firm on my value.
* **Message tone:**  I'm using a positive and collaborative tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  Highlighting the value the product provides to him could sway him towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,750. I'm really interested in this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm still within the first half of the negotiation rounds, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but I'm determined to see if I can achieve a more favorable outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.  Let's settle at $10,125. It's a fair price for both of us, and it demonstrates our shared commitment to finding a solution.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10125}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:** I'm continuing to bridge the gap between our positions, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. The $10,125 figure is another compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate.
* **Message tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone, emphasizing our shared goal of reaching an agreement. 
* **Highlighting the benefits:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the value the product brings to him, hoping to increase his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $10,125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, but I really need to stay within this range. Can we find a way to make it work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,900 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and there's still room for improvement. I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, but I'm determined to see if I can achieve a more favorable outcome with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to make one final compromise. Let's settle at $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. It's important to me that we finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer strategy:** I'm making a final concession, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a price above my minimum. The $10,000 figure is a compromise that demonstrates my willingness to reach a deal.
* **Message tone:** I'm using a firm but polite tone, emphasizing the importance of finalizing the deal. 
* **Highlighting commitment:**  I'm expressing my commitment to reaching a solution, hoping to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but I really need to stay within this range. Can we find a way to make it work? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiations have stalled, and Bob's offers remain below my minimum acceptable price.  While a deal with Bob is still a possibility, I'm running out of time and the risk of not getting a better offer is increasing.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $15,000, which is a safer and more reliable option at this point."
