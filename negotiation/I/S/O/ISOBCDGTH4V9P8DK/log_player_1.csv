Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly less than my minimum. This gives him room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $100,000 gap leaves space for potential counteroffers and a compromise.
* **Strong opening message:** I'm highlighting the win-win aspect of the offer, making it more appealing to Bob.

**Next steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and either accept his counteroffer if it's acceptable, make a new counteroffer, or move on to John if the negotiations seem unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss for me.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it does demonstrate his interest in the product.  There's still room for negotiation.
* **Strategic rejection:**  By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not willing to settle for such a low price and encourage him to make a more reasonable counteroffer.

**Next steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I'll also keep John as a backup option if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining my minimum:** Even with this counteroffer, I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Positive and encouraging:** I'm framing the offer as a way to reach a mutually beneficial outcome, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.

**Next steps:**

I'll be closely watching Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll have secured a profitable deal. If he rejects again, I'll need to carefully evaluate whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I can do $950,000, but that's really as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation seems unproductive:**  Despite my willingness to compromise, Bob's counteroffers have remained far below my minimum. This suggests that further negotiation may be futile.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,200,000, which is my minimum requirement.  This is a risk-free option.

**Next steps:**

I'll contact John and finalize the sale. While I would have preferred a higher price, I've secured a profitable deal and avoided the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
