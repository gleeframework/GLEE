"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its exceptional value, I'm starting the negotiation at $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the significant benefits you'll gain from owning it.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the potential benefits.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product significantly exceeds $850,000. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $950,000.  I believe this represents a fair price that would allow both of us to benefit from this transaction.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer!  I can see you're serious about this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000 even? This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial outcome.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $975,000. This offer reflects my genuine interest in this product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,6,
