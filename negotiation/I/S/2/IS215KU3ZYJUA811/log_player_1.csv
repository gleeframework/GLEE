Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the potential benefits.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $950,000.  I believe this represents a fair price that would allow both of us to benefit from this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob is moving closer to my bottom line, but I'm still willing to hold out for a better price. I'll counter-offer again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer!  I can see you're serious about this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000 even? This offer stands as a testament to my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial outcome."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $975,000. This offer reflects my genuine interest in this product while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for a higher price, $975,000 is a strong offer and significantly above Bob's initial offer. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or me misjudging the negotiation and losing the deal entirely."
