Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a unique chance to acquire it before I offer it to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value and potential"" subtly implies the price is justified without revealing your bottom line.
* **Urgency:**  Hinting at other interested parties (""exclusive opportunity,"" ""before I offer it to others"")  might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important:** This is a starting point.  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters or seems hesitant. You can always adjust downwards, but you can't go higher than your initial offer."
