{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you! I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price.  This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profits and keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest! While I value your business, $130 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140.  Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $135. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we won't reach an agreement, and I'm already guaranteed to get my minimum price from John.  It's better to secure the guaranteed profit."
