"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point, as it's a significant discount for Bob but still leaves me with a decent profit. I'll see if he's willing to bite, and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with $90. It's a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but it still leaves me with a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this price, as it's still a better deal for him than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to settle for that low of a price. I believe I can still get more from Bob.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

I'm counteroffering with $87.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum price of $80. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to negotiate, and that we're close to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and a better deal than selling to John.  We're in the 6th round and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  I'm also running out of rounds to make a better offer."
