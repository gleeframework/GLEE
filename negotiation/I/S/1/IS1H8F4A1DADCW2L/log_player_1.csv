We're still significantly above John's offer. Bob is moving closer to our desired range. Let's see if we can push him a little further."

Let me know if this works for you, as I'm quite optimistic about us finalizing this agreement."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000 for the product, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

While we could push for a bit more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is a strong outcome. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  It's well above John's offer and provides a $275,000 profit. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties if we continue negotiating.
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting shows Bob we're willing to compromise and builds goodwill for potential future deals."
