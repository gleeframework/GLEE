"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer meets my minimum requirement, I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum, especially in the early rounds.  I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,350,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. However, it still leaves room for further negotiation if needed and ensures I make a substantial profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is inching closer to my desired price, but I'm still not ready to accept.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can bridge the gap further.  I'm willing to accept a slightly lower price than my initial target, but only if Bob shows a genuine willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,300,000. This shows Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but also that I'm not willing to settle for significantly less than my initial offer. I'm hoping that this offer will be enough to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate. While his offer is still lower than my initial target,  $1,280,000 is a solid price and  represents a significant profit.  With only four rounds left, the risk of reaching a stalemate increases, and the time spent negotiating could be better spent closing the deal. Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
