"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $1,800,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,250,000? ",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like.  To be fair to us both, I propose $1,600,000. This offer reflects the product's value while hopefully fitting within your budget constraints.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
