"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is willing to sell for $1,100,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the value of this product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's already saved $150,000 from his initial budget and is within his target price range.  While he could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice is firm on her final offer.  There's a risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
