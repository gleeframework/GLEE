"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,100,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While the product is of interest, I'm looking to make a purchase closer to $900,000.  Would you be willing to consider this price point?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle at $1,050,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value and is a fair compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I understand the value of the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $950,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,000,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
