"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* It's better to reject and counteroffer to try and get a better price. 
* You still have 9 rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* It's still below your maximum budget, but leaves room for further negotiation. 
* The message is polite but firm, indicating that you are serious about buying the product but need a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $1,650,000? This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
*  You have 7 rounds left to negotiate, so there's still time to try and get a better price.
*  You can counter with a price closer to your limit. 
* Buying from John at this point would be more expensive than continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $1,650,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* This counteroffer is only $50,000 above your maximum budget, indicating a strong commitment to buying the product. 
* The message reinforces your willingness to pay a fair price, but also emphasizes that it's your final offer.
* This puts pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal. 
* With only 6 rounds left, it's time to push for a deal closer to your desired price."
