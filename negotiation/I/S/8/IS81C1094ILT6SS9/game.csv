"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $1,650,000? This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $1,650,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
