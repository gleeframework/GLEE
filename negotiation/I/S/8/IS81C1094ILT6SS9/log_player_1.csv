Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. $1,400,000 is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $1,650,000? This reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down, but $1,650,000 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price and significantly higher than what John is offering. It's a good deal for both of us and secures the sale."
