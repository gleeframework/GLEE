{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You're aware that the product is only worth $10,000 to Bob. 
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 allows you to potentially secure a significant profit. While it's unlikely Bob will accept this initial price, it sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Backup Plan (John):** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, ensuring you won't settle for anything less. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a high initial price gives you room to negotiate down if Bob shows interest but hesitates at the initial offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If you know Bob is extremely price-sensitive, you might start lower, though still above your minimum.
* **Product Uniqueness:** If the product is highly specialized and Bob has few alternative options, you can justify a higher price."
