"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate the middle ground approach. However, considering my budget, I would like to propose $10,000 as a fair price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $10,000 is still quite a ways off from what I have in mind. Let's settle at $15,500. This allows me to recoup a fair value while hopefully still working for your budget.",15500.0,Alice,5,
