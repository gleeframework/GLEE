Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for both of you.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance to offer Bob the product.

**Strategy**

The key is to propose a price that's attractive to Bob (meaning it's below his $1,500,000 valuation) while maximizing your gain.  Offering a price too close to $1,000,000 leaves potential profit on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects its significant potential to you. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Acknowledging Bob's exclusive opportunity adds a touch of urgency and importance.
* **Value-Based Language:**  Using phrases like ""unique value proposition"" and ""significant potential"" subtly reinforces the product's worth.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,350,000 leaves you with a significant profit margin while still offering Bob a $150,000 discount from his valuation.
* **Gentle Pressure:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is your only other option) creates a sense of competition and encourages Bob to act decisively. 

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a fluid process. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly, but remember your $1,000,000 baseline."
