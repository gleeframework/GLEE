{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 allows some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your ideal outcome.
* **Above Minimum:** The offer is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($10,000), ensuring a profitable deal even if Bob negotiates down slightly.
* **Alternative Option:** You have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob."
