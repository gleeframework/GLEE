"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It makes no sense to accept it. You should counteroffer or buy from John.  Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, buying from John for $1,000,000 is the most logical next step. However, the prompt asks for the next action, which is to reject Alice's offer and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My goal is to buy the product for the lowest price possible. Since I'm willing to pay up to $1,000,000, I'm starting with that amount as my counteroffer. This will give me the best chance of negotiating a good price while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my budget. I am willing to pay $1,000,000, and I know I can get the product from John for that price. There's no guarantee that I can negotiate further with Alice and get a lower price.  To ensure I get the product within my budget, I will buy it from John."
