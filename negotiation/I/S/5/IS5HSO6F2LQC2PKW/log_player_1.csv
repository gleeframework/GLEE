Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Giving Bob a little wiggle room encourages him to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** You still have room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **It's close to John's offer:** This provides a benchmark for what you're willing to accept. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings while keeping the negotiation going, so be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to you, and even below his own perceived value.  It's important to hold your ground here and try to negotiate a better price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can counter with a more reasonable price, potentially closer to your initial offer of $9,500. This keeps the negotiation going and increases your chances of earning a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $8,750 is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable value. There is a chance that you can squeeze a bit more out of Bob. Since you have a backup offer from John, you can afford to be a little more patient.

By rejecting his offer, you can counter with a price closer to your $9,000 offer. This shows you are willing to negotiate but also sets a firm limit on what you will accept. It's a strategy that balances your desire for a higher price with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me. Let's compromise at $8,900. This would be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8900} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,700? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,700 is still below your minimum acceptable value, and the negotiations have gone on for several rounds. At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation outweighs the potential benefit.  You've been able to nudge Bob closer to your desired price, but it's unlikely he will budge further.

Selling to John for $10,000 ensures you get your minimum desired value and avoids the risk of continued negotiation with Bob potentially ending in a lower price or no sale at all."
