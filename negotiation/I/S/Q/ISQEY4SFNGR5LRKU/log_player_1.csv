Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is my minimum, I can likely get more if I keep negotiating.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I need to make a bit more on this product to make it worthwhile for me. How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, as you value it at $120."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to stick to my initial proposal of $100. This is the maximum I am willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is adamant about his $100 offer.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll budge, and I've already reached my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for $100."
