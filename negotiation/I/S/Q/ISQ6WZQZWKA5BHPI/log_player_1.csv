Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone like you, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay significantly more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that is still very beneficial for you.
* **Consider Alternatives:** You have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, so you're not desperate. This strong fallback position allows for a bolder opening offer."
