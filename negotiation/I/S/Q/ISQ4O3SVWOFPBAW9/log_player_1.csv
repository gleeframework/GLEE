"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll love it! I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation and potentially earn more.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob more inclined to engage.
* **No hard sell:** I'm focusing on the product's value and asking for Bob's opinion, rather than aggressively pushing for a sale. 

This strategy allows for flexibility in the negotiation and keeps open the possibility of a successful outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates interest. This allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum without completely abandoning the negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Selling to John now would guarantee $120, but I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can maintain control of the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150 to make this work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is halfway between my minimum ($120) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows willingness to compromise while still securing a better deal than selling to John.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing that I'm ""willing to make this work"" to subtly remind Bob of the product's value.
* **Open to discussion:** By asking ""What do you think?"" I'm inviting further negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $150 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $120.  If you're open to that, we can make a deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no reason to keep negotiating further as I'm guaranteed to make my minimum.
* **Time constraint:**  We're already in round 4, so it's crucial to secure the deal before running out of time.  
* **No risk:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price."
