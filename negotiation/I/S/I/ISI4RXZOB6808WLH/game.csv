"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. Its value to you is immense, and I'm confident you'll find it a game-changer. My asking price is $1,400,000.  This reflects the true potential of the product and leaves room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,400,000 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  This is my maximum, and I believe it's a fair price for the value we both see in the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
