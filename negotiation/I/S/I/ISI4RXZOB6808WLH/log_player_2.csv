{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $1,400,000 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  This is my maximum, and I believe it's a fair price for the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
