"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation.  It's important to start high, as I don't know Bob's value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable, as I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still holding onto a profitable margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd love to get more, I've already rejected two offers and there's no guarantee I can push him higher. Accepting his offer of $1,250,000 ensures a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal completely."
