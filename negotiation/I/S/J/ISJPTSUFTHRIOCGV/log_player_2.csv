"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering its worth $12,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500. This is still a fair price for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I'd pay John and more than your asking price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, he can still potentially negotiate a lower price. He has already shown Alice that he's willing to walk away, which gives him leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm offering $10,750. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,750. However, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'll offer you the product for $11,100. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still pushing for a lower price. While Alice has moved closer to his target, he's not ready to accept just yet. He's shown he's willing to walk away and has leverage in the negotiation. He can likely secure a better deal with a final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10,500.  Let's try $10,900.  This would be a good compromise for both of us and ensure a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go down to $10,900. However, I'm willing to make another slight adjustment. I'll offer you the product for $11,200. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the price down as much as possible. While Alice has come down a bit, Bob can likely still negotiate a better deal. He's already demonstrated his willingness to walk away and is confident he can secure a price closer to $10,900."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're very close. I'm sticking to my offer of $10,900. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm not willing to go higher.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to look at other options."", ""product_price"": 10900}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to give in on the price. However, I'm willing to make one final adjustment. I'll offer you the product for $11,300. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and my initial asking price. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll need to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been pushing hard to get the price down, but Alice is unwilling to budge much further.  There's only one round left, and Bob has already made his best counteroffer.  Alice's last offer of $11,300 is still higher than his target, and he's shown he's not afraid to walk away. 

At this point, it's better for Bob to buy from John. Although he would prefer a lower price, he doesn't want to risk missing out on the product entirely by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
