{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counters.
* **Openness:**  I express willingness to negotiate, signaling that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Intrigue:**  I mention the product being ""fantastic"" without revealing specifics, hoping to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to engage. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. My strategy will adapt based on Bob's responses and my desire to maximize profit while still being willing to sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price around $8000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not in a rush to sell.  There's still potential to get more.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Bob is interested in the product and has signaled his willingness to negotiate.  There's room for a counteroffer that could secure a higher price.
* **Avoiding John's Deal:**  Selling to John right now would be the safe option, but it wouldn't maximize potential earnings.

**Next Step:** I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer that's slightly higher than his offer, aiming to close the gap while still leaving myself room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $9000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both some room to compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $10,000 to $9,000.
* **Fair Offer:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, making it a more attractive compromise.
* **Room for More:**  While I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, I'm still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation friendly and productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price around $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $7,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Accepting this offer would result in a loss.
* **Negotiation Still Possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he's still engaged in the negotiation. This suggests there's potential for a counteroffer that could get us closer to a mutually acceptable price.
* **John's Offer is Safe:**  Selling to John for $8,000 is the safest option, but it's not the most profitable. I'd like to see if I can secure a higher price with Bob.

**Next Step:** I will proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $7,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to make a final concession.  How about $8,500? That's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm signaling that this is my last offer, putting pressure on Bob to either accept or walk away.
* **Close to Minimum:** $8,500 is just $500 above my minimum acceptable price, but it leaves room for a little wiggle room if necessary.
* **Compromise Tone:** I'm emphasizing the ""good price for both of us"" to reiterate the idea of a compromise.
* **Closing the Deal:** The message explicitly aims to close the deal by asking for Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price around $7200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $7,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've been negotiating for a while, and it seems we've reached a stalemate.  It's unlikely Bob will go higher.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John for $8,000 is the most sensible option at this point. It guarantees me my minimum and avoids further potential losses from continued negotiation.

**Conclusion:** While I'd prefer to sell for a higher price, it's wiser to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed profit."
