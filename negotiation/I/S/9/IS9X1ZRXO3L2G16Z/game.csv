"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,800 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,150? I'm sure we can find a happy middle ground.",11150.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,900 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,000.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think $11,000 is a bit high. Can you consider $10,950? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay under $11,000.",10950.0,Bob,6,
