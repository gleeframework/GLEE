I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'll gauge his interest with this initial offer. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John for $800,000.  While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not confident I can get him to budge in the final round.  It's better to secure the $800,000 than risk getting nothing in the last round."
