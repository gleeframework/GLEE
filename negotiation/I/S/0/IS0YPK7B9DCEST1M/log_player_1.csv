Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, but not too high, leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters.  It also sets a positive tone and highlights the product's value. I'm willing to go down to $100 if Bob counters, but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
