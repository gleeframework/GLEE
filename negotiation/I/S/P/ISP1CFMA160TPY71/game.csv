"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price below its true worth.  Let me know if you're interested.",900000.0,Alice,1,
