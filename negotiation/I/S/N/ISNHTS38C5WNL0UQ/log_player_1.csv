""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is my final counteroffer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer matches my minimum acceptable price. Accepting guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
