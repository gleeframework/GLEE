"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since the product is worth $80 to Bob, he might be willing to negotiate down a bit. If he rejects, I'll see if I can get closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95. It's a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above what Bob offered. This should keep the negotiations going and potentially get us closer to a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. $85 is closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $90. It's still above Bob's offer of $85, but shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $87 is getting closer to my minimum price of $100, I'm still not willing to sell for that amount. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm going to counter with $90 again. Since Bob has raised his offer slightly, I believe this is a fair counteroffer. It's a good compromise between our current positions, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
