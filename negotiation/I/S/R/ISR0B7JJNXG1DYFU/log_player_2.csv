"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose an initial price of $12000. This is a special offer considering its high worth to you and our confidence in its ability to meet your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000, so it's not a good deal.  Therefore, rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.
