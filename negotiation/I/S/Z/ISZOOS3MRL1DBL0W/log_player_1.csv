{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want to make at least $10,000, and this offer gets you closer to that.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** You can still adjust the price if Bob counter-offers.

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep the price closer to $10000 since that's closer to its value to me. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum of $10,000, there's still room for negotiation to reach a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially get closer to your desired $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $12,000 is still quite a bit above my minimum.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward."", ""product_price"": 13000}
