"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good deal, you can likely get it for less. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to John's $150 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. I can do $115, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is still within your budget of $150 and significantly less than John's price.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up paying more."
