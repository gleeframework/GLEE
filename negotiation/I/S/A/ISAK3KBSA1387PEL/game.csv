"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly more than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  I understand your position, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would allow us both to find common ground. Let me know your thoughts.",950000.0,Bob,4,
