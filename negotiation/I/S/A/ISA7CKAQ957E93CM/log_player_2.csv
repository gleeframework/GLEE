"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe could be very valuable to you. It's currently worth $800000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price of $1300000. This is a significant discount from what I could get elsewhere, and it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price point that makes sense for your business.  Consider this a chance to secure a competitive advantage. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
