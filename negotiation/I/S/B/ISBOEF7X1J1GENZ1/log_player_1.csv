Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product and I'm interested in purchasing it. However, my budget is limited. Could we negotiate the price down to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $18,500. Would you consider accepting $16,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is slowly increasing his offer. We are still in a good position to negotiate a better price.  We're not in a rush to sell to John just yet."

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I appreciate your effort in finding a compromise. However, given my budget, I am unable to meet the price of $17,250. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has circled back to his original offer of $15,000 twice now.  This indicates he's unlikely to budge much higher. Since we have a guaranteed offer for the same price from John, it's time to cut our losses and sell to John. There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob if we're not going to get a better deal."
