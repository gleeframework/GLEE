"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment.  Let's meet halfway - how about $900,000? ",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I still feel that $900,000 is too high for my current budget. Could we perhaps aim for $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $875,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,5,
