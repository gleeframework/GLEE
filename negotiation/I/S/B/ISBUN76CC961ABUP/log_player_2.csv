Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a significant gap from what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 as my final offer.  This represents a considerable discount already, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.
