Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at a starting price of $22,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be useful, but not at that cost.  I could consider a price closer to $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $10,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 18000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a little on the price, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $12,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a significant gap from what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 as my final offer.  This represents a considerable discount already, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for working with me on this.  I understand this is a great product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  If you're willing to come down to $13,500, I can close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

While Bob is getting closer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Cutting my losses and taking the guaranteed $15,000 is the best move at this point."
