"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at a starting price of $22,000.  What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be useful, but not at that cost.  I could consider a price closer to $10,000.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $10,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a little on the price, but $18,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $12,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $12,000 is closer to what I have in mind, it's still a significant gap from what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $16,000 as my final offer.  This represents a considerable discount already, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for working with me on this.  I understand this is a great product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  If you're willing to come down to $13,500, I can close the deal today.",13500.0,Bob,6,
