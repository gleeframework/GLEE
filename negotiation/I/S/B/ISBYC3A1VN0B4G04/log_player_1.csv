"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $180 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to negotiate. How about $150?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point, but $150 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could try to push for a bit more, accepting $115 is a reasonable outcome. It avoids the risk of Bob walking away and ensures I make a profit."
