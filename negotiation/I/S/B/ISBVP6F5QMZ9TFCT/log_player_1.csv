Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $12,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This represents a significant savings for you and allows me to acquire the product within my price range.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
