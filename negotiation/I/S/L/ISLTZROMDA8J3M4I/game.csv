"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is truly unique.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000.  I believe this price point reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has unique value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,175,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be confident that we're at a price that works for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,212,500.  This represents a significant investment on your end, but I'm confident the product's value will far exceed it.",1212500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more serious offer, but I need to be at a price that's closer to my target. I'm thinking $1,100,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
