"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $850,000. This is a great price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000.",850000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the product's value, I'm not able to meet your price at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make a slight compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $810,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $810,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $780,000, but that's my final offer.  This price reflects the value of the product to me, and it's the most I can realistically pay.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make a decent profit. I'm counteroffering at $820,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",820000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $820,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $790,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I truly believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  With only a few rounds left, let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us.",790000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $790,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $820,000 and $790,000, which is $805,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",805000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're almost there!  I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm really pushing the limits of my budget.  My absolute final offer is $800,000.  This is the very best I can do.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to go with another seller. Let's make this deal happen!",800000.0,Bob,10,
