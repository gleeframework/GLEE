Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $700,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price through further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $700,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's meet in the middle.

This price still allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment while giving you a substantial discount from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 850000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While we are getting closer, I'm still not at the price point I'm comfortable with. I'm hoping to get closer to my target price through further negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  $750,000 is still a bit below my minimum acceptable value. How about we split the difference and go with $800,000? This price would allow you to acquire a truly unique and valuable product, while ensuring I can make a fair return on my investment.  I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I've done my research and I'm not willing to go above $800000. I'm willing to pay $780000 for the product. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $800,000. While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, it seems unlikely he'll meet it within the remaining rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable value, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure thing."
