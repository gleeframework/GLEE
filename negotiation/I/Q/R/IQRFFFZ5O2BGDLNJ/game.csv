"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let's get this done!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. The product is worth a lot more than that, and I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a reasonable profit.  How about we split the difference at $10,750? That's a fair compromise for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that number. How about we meet in the middle at $10,375? That way, we can both feel like we're getting a good deal.",10375.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I can't go any lower than $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the profit I need to make. Let's close this deal!",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Alice. How about we take it down to $10,250? I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last two offers, but I really need to keep the price under $10,500",10250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I see you're serious about getting this deal done, and I appreciate that. Let's compromise one last time. How about $10,400?  That's just a little over your last offer and it still gives me a decent profit. I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",10400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're still talking, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $10,350, but that's as high as I can go. I really need to keep the price under $10,400",10350.0,Bob,8,
