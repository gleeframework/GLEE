{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Alice. How about we take it down to $10,250? I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last two offers, but I really need to keep the price under $10,500
