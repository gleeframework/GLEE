"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,200,000. This is a significant amount below Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest.  I'm confident I can get a better deal than the $800,000 offered by John, so I'm not rushing to accept that offer just yet."
