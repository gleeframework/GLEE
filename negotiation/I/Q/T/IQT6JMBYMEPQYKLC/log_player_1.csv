"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic to see if he's willing to negotiate.  I'm also leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer because I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  $90 is still below my minimum threshold of $100, but I want to see if I can get him closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with $105. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it's still higher than my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum threshold, I'm still going to reject the offer.  I'm hoping to push for a bit more, and if it doesn't work, I can always sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm now offering the product for $100, my minimum acceptable price.  This is a strong signal that I'm serious about getting this deal done, but I'm not willing to go any lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation at this point. John's offer guarantees me a sale at my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that."
