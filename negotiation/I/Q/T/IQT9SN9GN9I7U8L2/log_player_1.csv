Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This is a common tactic to maximize potential earnings. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to counteroffer. This shows flexibility and increases the chance of reaching an agreement.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the product's potential benefit to Bob. This helps him see the value and encourages him to consider a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great!  I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or counter-offer again. 
* **If negotiations stall:** I can always switch to John, who is guaranteed to pay my minimum price of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It's also lower than the $12,000 I initially offered.  Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss. While I am open to negotiation, Bob's counteroffer is too low to even consider.

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price. This will give me a better chance of securing a profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the benefits you'll gain.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm not accepting Bob's low offer, but I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by reducing my price.
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Clear Price:** I'm giving Bob a clear price point, making it easier for him to decide.
* **Openness:** I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the negotiation we've had so far. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I would ideally like to get closer to my initial goal, continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  

Considering the value of the product to Bob, the potential time commitment of further negotiation, and the guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice."
