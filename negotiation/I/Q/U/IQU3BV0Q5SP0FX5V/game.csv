"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however,  $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $18,000 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget. Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this work - how about we settle at $15,000? This is my final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
