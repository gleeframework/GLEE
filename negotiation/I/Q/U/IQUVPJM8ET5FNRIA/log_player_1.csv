"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $19,000 is way above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $12,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its value.  To make this work, I could come down to $17,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident this product is worth a lot to both of us, so let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $14,000 is a reasonable compromise. It exceeds his initial offer and provides me with a profit above my minimum. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or losing the sale altogether.
