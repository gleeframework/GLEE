"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $19,000. I'm open to discussing further, so let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $19,000 is far above his maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a better price can be reached."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its value.  To make this work, I could come down to $17,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000.

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his limit.  He should continue negotiating and try to get closer to his $12,000 target."
