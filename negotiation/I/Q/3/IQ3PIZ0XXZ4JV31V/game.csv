"I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $17,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $17,000, so how about $15,500?",15500.0,Bob,4,
