Round 7

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $12,500, which would be $13,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. What do you think?

We are now too far apart in the negotiation. Alice is unlikely to come down to $10,000 and it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation further.  It's time to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
