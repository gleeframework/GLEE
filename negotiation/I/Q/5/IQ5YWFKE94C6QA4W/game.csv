"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000. Would that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $12,000? I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close to an agreement. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13,500. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal as well. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  $13,500 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $12,500?  That's my final offer.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $12,500, which would be $13,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,7,
