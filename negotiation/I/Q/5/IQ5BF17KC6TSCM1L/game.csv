"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit too high. How about we meet at $1,250,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and land at $1,300,000? That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target. How about we meet at $1,200,000? I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price I'm comfortable with.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand budget constraints are real, but I've been very reasonable throughout this negotiation. $1,300,000 is my final offer.  I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product. Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, which is $1,250,000. I hope we can agree on this price.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
