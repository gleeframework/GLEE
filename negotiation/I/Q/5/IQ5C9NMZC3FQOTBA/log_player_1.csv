"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for significant returns on your investment. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression the product is highly valuable. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and potential for ""significant returns"" provides Bob with a reason for the high price, even if he initially perceives it as too expensive.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's input, signaling your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly below both your initial asking price and your minimum acceptable price. While it's closer to his perceived value, accepting at this point would mean a substantial loss for you.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if you can reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential of this product.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This takes into account the long-term benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate but maintains a price significantly above Bob's initial offer and your minimum. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  Emphasizing the ""true potential"" and ""long-term benefits"" reminds Bob of the value proposition you presented initially, justifying the higher price point. 
* **Encouraging a Counter:**  By making a substantial reduction, you encourage Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still seeking a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, signaling his interest in the product. However, $1,300,000 is still significantly below your $1,500,000 safety net with John. You have room to negotiate and should aim for a price closer to your minimum acceptable amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,600,000.  This reflects a significant compromise on my end while ensuring the value of the product is recognized.  I believe this is a fair and mutually beneficial offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  You've reduced your price considerably, but this offer is still above your guaranteed sale price with John. It demonstrates a willingness to compromise but sets a firm boundary.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** Framing this as a ""mutually beneficial offer"" and acknowledging your ""compromise"" encourages Bob to see it as a win-win scenario.
* **Time Constraint (Implied):** As rounds progress, the implied pressure of you potentially selling to John increases. This could nudge Bob to accept a price closer to your terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've reviewed your latest offer and I appreciate your efforts. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,400,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your safety net of $1,500,000 with John. While you could try to push for a slightly higher price in the remaining rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that you might not reach a significantly better deal. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
