Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since John provides a guaranteed $10,000, Alice should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially settling on a price higher than $10,000.
* **Perceived Value:**  By positioning the product as ""highly valuable"" and an ""exclusive opportunity,"" Alice aims to increase Bob's perceived value, making him more likely to accept a higher price.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, the potential for a higher profit outweighs the guaranteed $10,000 from John in this scenario."
