"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50?",132.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $132.50 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'll offer $115, and I think that's a fair compromise.",115.0,Bob,4,
