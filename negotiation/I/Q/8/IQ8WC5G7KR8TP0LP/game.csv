"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm open to finding a compromise. How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further. How about we meet at $1,200,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
