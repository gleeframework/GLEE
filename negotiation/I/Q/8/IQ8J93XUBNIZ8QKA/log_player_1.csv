Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm happy to offer it at a price of $1,190,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob will pay a bit more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,190,000 is a strong offer. It's significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) while still netting me a profit close to my guaranteed sale price.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" motivates Bob to act quickly and consider the offer seriously."
