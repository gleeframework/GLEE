Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's interest:** I'm highlighting the value to him, making the offer more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm  expressing willingness to negotiate, while still setting a high initial price.
* **Safety net:** I have John as a backup buyer, allowing me to walk away if the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, it demonstrates his willingness to negotiate. This suggests there's room for a better offer. 
* **John as backup:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,075,000. This gives you a great deal and allows me to achieve a fair price for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a middle ground:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $1,075,000. This shows I'm flexible while still aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Highlighting the benefit for Bob:** I'm emphasizing that this price offers a good deal for him.
* **Staying firm on my minimum:** While I've lowered my price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating that I won't settle for a price much below my minimum.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand the value of the product and your position, but I would like to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,025,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited negotiation potential:**  While Bob is willing to pay slightly more, it's clear we are far apart in our price expectations. Further negotiation might take too much time and effort.
* **Time and Effort:** Continued negotiation might not lead to a significantly better offer. 
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and allows me to secure a sale with minimal further effort.

Therefore, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
