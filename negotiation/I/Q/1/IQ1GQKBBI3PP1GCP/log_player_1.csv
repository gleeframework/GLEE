Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your absolute lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $800,000 to Bob.  He won't rationally pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There is no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum.  Any deal depends on you leaving money on the table or Bob paying more than he values the product for.

**Possible Strategies**

1. **High Anchor:** Start with a very high price (significantly above $1,200,000). This could make Bob view any offer closer to $1,200,000 as more reasonable. This is risky as it might make Bob immediately walk away.

2. **Direct but Fair:** Propose a price slightly above your minimum, acknowledging that you have another buyer.  This is transparent but might not net you the highest possible price.

**The Offer**

Given the lack of a ZOPA, the 'Direct but Fair' approach seems more plausible:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I finalize a deal with another buyer.  Given my current situation, the lowest I could consider is $1,250,000."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Important Considerations**

* **Relationship:** Is maintaining a good relationship with Bob important for future deals? If so, a less aggressive approach might be better.
* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start higher.

**This situation highlights the importance of knowing your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement) â€“ in your case, selling to John. This allows you to negotiate from a position of strength.**"
