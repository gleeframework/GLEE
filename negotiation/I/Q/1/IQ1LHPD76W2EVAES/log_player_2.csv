"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I believe this product will bring you significant value and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stating her offer is her minimum acceptable price. While she might be bluffing, there's no incentive for you to accept this offer outright.  You can try to get a better price by rejecting and seeing if she'll come down. The worst that happens is you buy from John at the same price."
