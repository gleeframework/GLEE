Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $119. I know you'll find it valuable, so let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, since that's John's guaranteed offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below John's offer ($119) leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit if he accepts.
* **Create Urgency:**  Phrases like ""for a steal"" aim to make Bob feel like he's getting a great deal, potentially pushing him to accept quickly."
