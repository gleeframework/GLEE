"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this product, Bob! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get it into your hands, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for my investment. What do you think?
