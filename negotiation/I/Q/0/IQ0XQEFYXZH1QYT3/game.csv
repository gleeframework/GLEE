"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiating, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away happy.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. What do you think?",9200.0,Bob,4,
