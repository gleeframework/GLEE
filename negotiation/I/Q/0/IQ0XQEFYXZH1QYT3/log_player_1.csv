{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a good price, and I get a fair return.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my ideal price, I believe I can get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiating, $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, $9,200 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's better to secure a sale than to hold out for a potentially higher price and risk ending up with nothing."
