"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $12000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can we meet in the middle at $10500?",10050.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10050. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $11500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you think about meeting me at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that I'm not going to get a good deal from you, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need you to meet me at a price I can live with. I'm thinking $9500. That's my final offer, and I'm not going any higher.",9500.0,Bob,6,
