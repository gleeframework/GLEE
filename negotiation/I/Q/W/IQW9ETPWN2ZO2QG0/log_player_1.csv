Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a price that is likely to be appealing to Bob as it's lower than the value he places on the product ($12,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I can likely get more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $9,000. I'm hoping to close the deal at this price, as it's still a good profit for me and likely attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer to sell for $9,500, Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price.  There's a chance we could continue negotiating but it's likely the price won't go up much further, and risking losing the sale to John for $8,000 isn't worth it."
