"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation but still get a good price.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum.  While I'm interested in selling to him, I need to make sure I get a fair price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $150. This is a great deal, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm counteroffering at my minimum price. This is a fair price for me and gives Bob a better price than his initial offer.  Hopefully, this will be the sweet spot to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $150 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite satisfied with that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your interest and we're getting closer! How about we split the difference and go with $140?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to try one last counteroffer at $140, which is in the middle of my minimum and Bob's last offer. Hopefully, this will be enough to seal the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $135 is getting closer, but I've reached my limit for negotiation. I'm starting to feel like we are not going to reach a deal, and I don't want to waste more time. I'm going to sell the product to John for $150.  While it's not as much as I initially hoped for, it's still above my minimum and I can move on to other buyers."
