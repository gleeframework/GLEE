Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, I'll make an offer that's slightly higher than that to leave some room for negotiation.

{""product_price"": 17,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is $15,000, which is the minimum value I was willing to accept. Since I don't want to sell the product for less than its minimum value, I'll choose option (1) and accept Bob's offer.
