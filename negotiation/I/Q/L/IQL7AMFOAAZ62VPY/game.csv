"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, I know the true value of this product is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is my final offer, as I'm confident I can find other buyers at this price point.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I could meet you halfway at $750,000.  This offer stands as a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
