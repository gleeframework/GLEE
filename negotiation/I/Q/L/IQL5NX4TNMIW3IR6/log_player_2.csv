It's something I'm personally valuing at no less than $15,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $16,000.  This is a special price just for you, considering your potential use for the product. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. If you're not, I'll be selling it to someone else for $15,000.
