Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm setting the price at $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $11,999 as possible, leaving Bob with a small incentive to buy while maximizing her own profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below her minimum price.
* **Negotiation Room:** The slightly high price leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he's interested but not entirely sold at $11,500."
