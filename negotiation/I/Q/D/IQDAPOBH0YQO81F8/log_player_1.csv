Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130 for it."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a good profit, but also keeping in mind that Bob values the product higher than me.  I'll be ready to negotiate further if needed, but if we can't reach an agreement, I'm happy to sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price. I believe the product is worth more and I'm going to counter with a higher price, hoping to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a little higher than that.  How about $115?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle on $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum asking price of $100, and I'm confident that I can still make a decent profit.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
