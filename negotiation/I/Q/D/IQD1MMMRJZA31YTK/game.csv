"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price that's slightly below what I'm willing to accept. I'll offer it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price that's closer to what I'm looking for. I'll counter with $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a deal. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,
