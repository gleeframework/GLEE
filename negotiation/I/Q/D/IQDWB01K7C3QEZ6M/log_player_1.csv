"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum value but might be attractive to Bob if he values the product highly. I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (if any)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum value, I'm not eager to accept it right away. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $135. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still trying to secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm not ready to settle for $125 just yet, especially since I have John as a backup buyer. I'll try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm going to lower my counteroffer to $130. This shows a willingness to compromise and makes it more likely that Bob will accept, while still giving me a better price than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $127. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise. We've gone through several rounds, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly higher price. Accepting this offer ensures a sale and a profit that's better than what I'd get from John."
