Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a price significantly higher than our minimum ($800,000) but below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). 
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more amenable to a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While we start high, there's room for Bob to negotiate down. This strategy allows us to potentially secure a price closer to his perceived value.

This approach aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price that's appealing compared to his valuation."
