Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than my absolute minimum, it's still below what I consider fair value for the product.  I'm confident I can get a better price, either through negotiation with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a counteroffer of $1,250,000. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. It shows willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm open to negotiation, it's getting close to my minimum.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John. It's a guaranteed deal at a price I'm comfortable with."
