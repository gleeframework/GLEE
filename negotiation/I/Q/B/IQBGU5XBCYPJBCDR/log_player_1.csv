Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in.  I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than my minimum value but allows for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing that I'm open to discussion. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Maximizes potential profit:**  Starting high gives me more room to negotiate if Bob is interested.
* **Avoids immediate rejection:** A lower starting price might make Bob think he can get it for even less. 
* **Keeps the door open:** The message emphasizes a willingness to negotiate, giving Bob an incentive to respond. 

If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed backup buyer in John, so there's no risk of losing money."
