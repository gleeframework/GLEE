"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $140. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $160 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. How about $150?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me there.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $150. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to get at least $155 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",155.0,Alice,5,
