{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, my goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first gives me a chance to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $1,350,000 is carefully chosen:
    * It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), leaving room for negotiation.
    * It's still a substantial discount from John's offer ($1,500,000), making it attractive to Bob.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting discussion. This encourages Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer, giving me further insights into his willingness to pay.

By starting with a strong offer and maintaining open communication, I increase my chances of securing the best possible deal, whether it's with Bob or ultimately with John."
