"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives you a good margin for profit. Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to encourage negotiation and create room for compromise.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  The message emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potentially motivating him to accept.
* **Urgency:** The message highlights the potential for a deal, subtly pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A price of $1,750,000 leaves space for negotiation without jeopardizing my minimum desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $1,400,000 is less than my minimum desired value of $1,500,000.  
* **Potential for better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and a higher price.  
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to explore options for a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1,400,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This still gives you a significant profit margin, and it ensures we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer with Justification:** I'm making a counter-offer that's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. I'm also providing a justification for this price, emphasizing its value and the potential for profit.
* **Emphasis on Middle Ground:** I'm framing the offer as a ""meeting in the middle,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm reminding Bob about the product's value and the potential for a good deal for him.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping my minimum desired price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,600,000, so I'll offer $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer meets my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly my minimum desired value.
* **No further negotiation needed:**  Since I'm satisfied with this price and have a backup offer from John, there's no need to continue negotiations and risk losing a deal. 
* **Final offer:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer, suggesting he's unlikely to go higher.

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and successful sale at my minimum desired value."
