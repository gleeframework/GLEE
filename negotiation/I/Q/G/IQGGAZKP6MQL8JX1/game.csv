"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives you a good margin for profit. Let's get this deal done!",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1,400,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,600,000. This still gives you a significant profit margin, and it ensures we both get a good deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,600,000, so I'll offer $1,500,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
