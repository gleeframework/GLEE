Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming to get as close to Bob's maximum value as possible while still securing a good profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is still a significant amount for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I was aiming for. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob, and I want to see if I can push him closer to my initial offer of $1,400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a higher price to make this worthwhile. I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good price and keeping Bob interested.  This counteroffer is still within his budget, and hopefully, it's tempting enough for him to accept."
