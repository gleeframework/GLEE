"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good deal, it's still within your budget, and there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. This is still a significant amount for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to see a higher price to make this worthwhile. I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as it's still within his budget and significantly lower than the price from John.  It's worth accepting the offer and closing the deal."
