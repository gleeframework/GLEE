{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

This offer is strategic for a few reasons:

* **It's a strong starting point:** $9,500 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It shows you're serious:**  By making a concrete offer, you demonstrate your willingness to deal and encourage Bob to engage.
* **It allows for flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer, ensuring you get the best possible price. 

Remember, you can always walk away and sell to John for $10,000, so you're not obligated to accept any offer that's lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what you're willing to accept. You're better off rejecting his offer and trying to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $8,500? It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find common ground:**  $8,500 is closer to Bob's offer but still above your minimum threshold. 
* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  It demonstrates that you're open to compromise without sacrificing too much.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  It encourages Bob to respond and potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer of $8,000 is close to your minimum threshold and a good deal considering you can sell to John for $10,000.  Accepting his offer allows you to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
