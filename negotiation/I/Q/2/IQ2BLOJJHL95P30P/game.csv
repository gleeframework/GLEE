"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's significantly higher than my budget allows.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price reflecting the potential benefit I see. ",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is substantial and I can't accept a price that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However,  $900,000 is still outside of my budget. Given the market value and my own assessment, I'm confident that $750,000 is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's meet halfway on this.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firmer on the price to reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm confident that $800,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",800000.0,Bob,6,
