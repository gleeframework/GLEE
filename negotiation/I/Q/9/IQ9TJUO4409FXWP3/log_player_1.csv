``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum.  This should encourage him to negotiate, but gives me room to compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can do better. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This is still a great deal for you as it's worth $15,000 to you."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we agree on $11,500? That's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to accept. I'm only $500 away from my preferred price of $12,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a slightly higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
