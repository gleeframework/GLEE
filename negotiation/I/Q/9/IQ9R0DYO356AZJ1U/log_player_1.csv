Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is still significantly less than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob a reason to counteroffer, allowing for a back and forth to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Knowing my fallback:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not under any extreme pressure to make major concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a great deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,200,000 is still a profit for me, it's significantly lower than my initial offer and doesn't reflect the product's true value to him.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target. 
* **The risk of selling to John:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit, it's also a lower profit than I'm aiming for. 

I'm choosing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows you to get the product at a very attractive price. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but I'm not giving away too much. 
* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This suggests a fair and reasonable compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the great deal Bob still gets at this price, even though it's a slight increase from his offer."
