"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $130, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $130 is less than what he'd pay John, there's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $120 is a good price for him, as it's lower than what he would pay John.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice could reject his counteroffer and he'd be stuck paying John's higher price."
