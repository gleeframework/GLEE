{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $130, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a friendly tone and shows willingness to listen to Bob's perspective, which might lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $110.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

 While $110 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
