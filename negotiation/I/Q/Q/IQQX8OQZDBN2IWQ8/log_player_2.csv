"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value.  Let me know what you think!

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further, but $9,500 is still too low. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $11,250.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 simply isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500 as a final concession,  This is a very fair price, considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating.  It's my final offer, let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $10,500.  While she might be bluffing about it being her final offer, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to it and you having to buy from John anyway. You're better off taking the guaranteed $10,000 deal with John now."
