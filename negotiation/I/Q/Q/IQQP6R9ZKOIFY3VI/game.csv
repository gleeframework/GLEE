"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Alice,3,
