Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to maximize my potential profit by starting with a higher offer to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $12,000 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down if he finds the price too high. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the $10,000 value, I'm anchoring Bob's perception of the product's worth while still aiming for a higher price. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale with Bob, avoiding the need to go to John."
