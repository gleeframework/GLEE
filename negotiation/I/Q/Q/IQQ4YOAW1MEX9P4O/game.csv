"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $9500 for our premium product? This still offers a significant discount compared to the original price, while allowing us to accommodate your financial considerations.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,
