Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing a price of $13,500.  This is a fantastic deal considering its true value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 (our minimum acceptable price) as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $13,500 gives Bob the impression of a potential ""deal"" while leaving some room for negotiation if he counter-offers. 
* **Backup Offer:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so there's no pressure to go below Bob's maximum perceived value.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a sale with Bob."
