"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. To kick off the negotiations, I'm proposing a starting price of $14,000.  What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is quite a bit below my bottom line. I could consider letting it go for $12,500. This product truly is exceptional and I believe it's a fair price. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. $11,000 is close, but I need to get a little closer to my target. How about we settle on $11,750?  I believe that's a fair compromise.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $11,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000, and I think that's a fair price for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",11000.0,Bob,6,
