"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
