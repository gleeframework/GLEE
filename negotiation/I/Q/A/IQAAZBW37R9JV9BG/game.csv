"I appreciate the offer, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is significantly below the value I know this product holds.  How about we meet in the middle at $1200000? This price is still fair considering the potential of the product, and it gives us both a solid deal. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1050000, but I still need to consider the true value of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is a fair compromise. This offers a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I've considered your offer, but at $1000000, it's still significantly lower than the value I need to achieve.  I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the potential of the product.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I hope you can consider accepting it.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
