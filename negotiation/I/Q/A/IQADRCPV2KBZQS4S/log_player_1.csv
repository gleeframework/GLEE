"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a strategic move to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. It's important to remember my goal is to maximize profit, and starting high gives me room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to settle just yet.  I believe there's room to negotiate, especially since Bob's initial offer was so low. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a better price. This strategy should keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I believe I can still get more by continuing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $8,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to reach an agreement.  It's also a halfway point between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's last offer, showing that I am genuinely trying to find common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and with only 4 rounds left, the chances of him coming up to my acceptable price are getting slim.  I've tried to negotiate, but it seems like he's unwilling to meet my expectations. Therefore, it's best to cut my losses and sell to John for $8,000 to guarantee a profit."
