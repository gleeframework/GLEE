"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to explore if Bob is willing to pay closer to my value, and it leaves room for him to counter-offer without feeling like he's being pressured too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $120. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering a price that's still above my minimum and closer to my desired price point. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway, but if not, we'll continue to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $100 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'll offer you $95. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up a little bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $98.  This is my final offer before I consider selling to another buyer. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm offering a price that's just below my minimum, hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about selling and meet me halfway.  I'm also trying to apply a little pressure by mentioning the other buyer, John."
