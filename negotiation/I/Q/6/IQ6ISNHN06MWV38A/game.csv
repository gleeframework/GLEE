"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant discount already, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  This offer reflects the true value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the offer,  $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which I believe is a fair price.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,6,
