"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $10,000 to you, so I'm offering it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings you. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile. I'm offering the product for $10,500. This price still provides you with significant value, and it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're open to it.",10250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to stay closer to $11,000 to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,750. This price still gives you a significant value, and it's a compromise I'm comfortable with. Let me know if you're interested.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting very close to a deal. I'm willing to go down to $10,600, but that's my absolute final offer. I'm confident this price still provides you with significant value, and it's the best I can do. If you're not interested, I'm going to have to consider other options.
