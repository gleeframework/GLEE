"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's an exceptional opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose we discuss a price that reflects its true worth while ensuring a fair deal for both parties. Considering the product's significance and your interest, I would like to suggest a starting point of $1,200,000. Let's explore this further and see if we can reach an agreement that satisfies both our expectations.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is certainly valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while still leaving room for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your input and understand your position. In light of your offer, I would like to counter with a proposal of $1,050,000 for the product.

I am open to further discussion and adjustments to ensure we achieve a satisfactory outcome for both parties.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000. This price fairly reflects the value of the product while ensuring a profitable transaction for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
