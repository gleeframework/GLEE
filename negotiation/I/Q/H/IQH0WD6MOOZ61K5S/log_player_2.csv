# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's a high-quality item that I believe would be valuable to you. I am asking for $120 for it, considering its worth to me and the effort put into it. I hope we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.
