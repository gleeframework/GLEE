"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm not quite ready to go that high yet. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Alice's offer of $11,000 is still within Bob's budget of $12,000.
* **Saving:**  This offer saves Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Compromise:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer represents a compromise between their previous positions.
* **Risk:**  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price or a stalemate.

While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer offers a good balance of saving money and ensuring a deal."
