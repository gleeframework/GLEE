Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as I am hoping to get a bit more than my minimum price. I'm also not yet desperate enough to sell to John, who is only willing to pay the minimum. I will try to negotiate with Bob to see if I can get a better price."
