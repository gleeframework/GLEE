Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic [product description - be vague but intriguing] that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:**  $15,000 is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still significantly exceeding your minimum value.
* **Intriguing Description:**  A vague description like ""fantastic""  piques Bob's interest without revealing too much. It encourages him to ask questions and potentially value the product higher.
* **Open-ended Question:**  ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and express his interest. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high and being open to negotiation, we aim to:

* **Maximize our potential profit:**  We're aiming for a price closer to the value Bob might place on the product.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His reaction will tell us how much he values the product. 
* **Maintain control:**  We can always walk away and sell to John, but we're hoping to get a better deal from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is closer to our minimum acceptable value of $10,000, but we can potentially do better. By rejecting his offer, we keep the negotiation going and aim for a higher price.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  There's still room for negotiation. We can make a counteroffer that might be closer to our desired price point.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that we are not desperate to sell and are willing to walk away if necessary.
* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:**  By seeing how far he's willing to go, we can better understand his true interest and willingness to pay.

**Next Step:**

We'll send Bob a counteroffer closer to our ideal price, hoping to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $12,500? That's a fair price considering the [briefly mention a key feature or benefit of the product] you'll get with it."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** We're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price closer to our desired range.
* **Highlight Value:**  Mentioning a key feature/benefit subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth.
* **Fair Price:**  The counteroffer feels reasonable, suggesting we're open to a deal but not desperate.

**Strategy:**

We're aiming to:

* **Maintain Upper Hand:**  We're not accepting his initial offer, indicating our value for the product.
* **Find Common Ground:**  $12,500 is a midpoint between our previous offer and his offer, inviting a potential agreement.
* **Encourage Further Negotiation:**  We're keeping the door open for more negotiation, but we've set a clear price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the benefits of the product, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. How about $12200? I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,200 is still a bit below our initial ask, it's very close to our desired price range and significantly higher than our minimum value.  Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale.

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** We're within a reasonable distance from our desired price point.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Maintaining a good relationship with Bob could lead to future opportunities.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  There's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better outcome, and we risk losing Bob entirely.

**Decision:**

By accepting Bob's offer, we secure a strong profit and avoid further negotiation. This is the most practical choice at this point, considering our goal of maximizing profit while minimizing risk."
