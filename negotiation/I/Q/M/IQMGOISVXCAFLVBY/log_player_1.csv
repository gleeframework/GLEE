Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $140, which is still above my minimum but shows a willingness to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."

Bob's latest offer is getting too low. While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of continuing is that I might end up with a price that's lower than what John is willing to pay.  To guarantee a profit, I'll sell the product to John for $150."
