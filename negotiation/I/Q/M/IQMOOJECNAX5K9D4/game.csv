"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I'm confident this price reflects the true value you'll gain from it.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend. How about $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to accept $1,750,000. This is my final offer, as it's a significant compromise already.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,750,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
