"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 150} 

I'm starting high to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'm confident John will offer me my minimum price, so I have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my minimum price of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm still well above my minimum price and hoping Bob will see the value in the product and come closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not at my goal.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to budge a little more.  I still have time to negotiate, and I don't want to miss out on potentially earning more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm making a small concession by lowering the price to $115. This demonstrates my willingness to reach a compromise. I'm still confident I can get a price closer to my minimum and am hopeful Bob will be more agreeable now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only $5 below my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for the same price. It's better to secure a sale now."
