Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Starting high:**  While Bob's perceived value is lower, there's a chance he might be willing to pay more than $80, especially if the product is something he needs or really wants. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While this offer doesn't leave much room, it opens the door for Bob to counter-offer if he's at all interested. You can then decide if you want to negotiate down slightly or stick to your original price knowing John will buy it."
