"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price that is a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. I believe this is a reasonable starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'd like to see if I can secure a better price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $125 is only $5 less than my initial counter-offer and is a decent deal.  It's getting close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
