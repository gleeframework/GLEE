"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $400000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $400000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'd be willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $900000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $700000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",700000.0,Bob,4,
