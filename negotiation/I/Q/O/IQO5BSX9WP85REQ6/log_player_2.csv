"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and allows me to earn a healthy profit. Please let me know if you're interested. If not, I'll be selling it to John for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
