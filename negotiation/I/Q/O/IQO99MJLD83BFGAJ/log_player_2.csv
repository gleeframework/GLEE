"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its features and benefits, I'm offering it at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than Alice's value of $10,000. This means there's room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a better deal before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $14,000. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be happy to buy it for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from $14,000 to $13,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $12,000. At this point, it's worth accepting the offer.  Bob is still getting a good deal, saving $2,000 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away or Bob potentially losing out to John's higher price."
