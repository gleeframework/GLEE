{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $15,000. This is a great deal, as the product is worth much more than that.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm expressing my belief that this is a good deal for Bob, which can make him more inclined to negotiate.
* **Openness:** I'm explicitly inviting Bob to respond, making it clear that I'm open to negotiation. 

This approach allows me to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** Starting high gives me the best chance to earn more.
* **Gauge Bob's interest:**  His response will reveal how much he values the product.
* **Prepare for counteroffers:** I'm ready to negotiate if Bob's offer isn't acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $12,000. Selling to John guarantees me a secure $12,000, which is closer to my desired profit margin. Therefore, I'm rejecting Bob's offer and preparing to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints by coming down from my initial offer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing justification for my counteroffer by highlighting the value of the product.
* **Openness:** I'm again inviting Bob to respond, signaling my willingness to continue negotiating.

This approach aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  My counteroffer bridges the gap between my minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests. 
* **Increase chances of a deal:** A reasonable counteroffer may make Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my minimum desired price of $12,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $12,000,  it's a good compromise.  It's also  more profitable than selling to John for $12,000. Therefore, I'm accepting Bob's offer to maximize my profit and avoid further negotiation."
