Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1000000 is still a bit too high.  Given the product's worth to you, I'm willing to pay $900000.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. $900,000 is still below my minimum of $800,000, and I'm confident I can get more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to close the deal quickly.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
