"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's room for negotiation, and Bob should aim to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for us both to benefit from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm open to negotiating. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $1,350,000 is still above Bob's target. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his $1,200,000 goal.  Rejecting the offer allows him to counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget. Let's try $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing us both to close the deal and potentially move forward with future collaborations. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to continue the negotiation. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll counter with a price of $1,320,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's target price, but $1,320,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate to see if he can push Alice further down.  If Alice doesn't budge, he can always choose to buy from John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm happy to go up to $1,280,000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1280000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,280,000, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. Considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counter with a price of $1,290,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and shows my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,290,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,290,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,290,000 is still above Bob's budget of $1,200,000. While there's only a small difference, Bob has already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and is likely getting close to his limit. It's highly probable that Alice will not budge further.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, it's the most sensible choice at this point to avoid further negotiation and secure the product within his budget."
