"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for some room for us both to benefit from this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm open to negotiating. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counter with a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget. Let's try $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing us both to close the deal and potentially move forward with future collaborations. ",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to continue the negotiation. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to make another concession.
