"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for $8,000, so I can afford to be a bit more patient and see if I can get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about we split the difference at $8,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original offer, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,800 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, it's still not enough. I'm only in round 4 out of 10, and I have the option to sell to John for $8,000.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $7,800 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $8,200? I think that would be a fair price considering the value of this product for you."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $8,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,900 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $7,900 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, I'm concerned that we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds and I don't want to risk not getting a better offer. I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, which guarantees me my minimum price. It's a safer option than continuing to negotiate and risking ending up with a lower offer or running out of time."
