Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,150,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping you'll consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,100,000 makes the most sense at this point. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** This price still provides a significant profit above my minimum of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or stalling the negotiation.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now allows me to utilize the earnings sooner, rather than risking further negotiation rounds with no guarantee of a better outcome."
