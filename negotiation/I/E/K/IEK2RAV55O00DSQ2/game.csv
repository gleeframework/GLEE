"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $12000? That's a fair price for the value of this product. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9500 simply won't work for me. It's important for me to get a fair price for this product. Would you be willing to go up to $11000? This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,5,
