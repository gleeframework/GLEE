"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice and only $800,000 to me. I should aim to get the price closer to my valuation.  Rejecting the first offer will allow me to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $880,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, I can still try to negotiate further. I can counteroffer again and try to get the price down to my target of $800,000."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  However, $880,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to close the deal at $825,000.  Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $825,000. I can meet you halfway between $825,000 and $880,000, which would be $852,500. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $852,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $852,500
