"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to part with it for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no reason to pay $140."
