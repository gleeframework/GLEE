Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, as I have other interested parties. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have room to start high.  A price of $1,200,000 aims to significantly increase your profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's worth to Bob, it implies a high value by using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value and potential.""
* **Time pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important:** This strategy involves risk. Bob might be turned off by the high price and reject the offer outright. However, the potential reward of a much higher profit makes it a calculated risk worth considering."
