{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to try to get a better price than $85.  I'm not desperate, so I can risk rejecting Bob's offer and going to the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

I'm still holding out for a price closer to $90. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a little more in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $86.  While I'd prefer $88, I've already rejected his previous offer, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to close the deal now than risk getting a lower price from John or losing the sale altogether."
