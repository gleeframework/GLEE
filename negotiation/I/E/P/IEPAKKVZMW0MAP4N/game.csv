,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find this product to be well worth the investment.",87.5,Alice,5,
