"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'd be happy to pay $12,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is your maximum, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $15,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider.",15000.0,Alice,3,
