Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still provides a significant value for you while allowing me to make a fair profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're at your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $1,060,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1,065,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Price is reasonable:**  $1,065,000 is a significant saving compared to John's $1,500,000 price.
* **Alice is firm:** Her language suggests she's unlikely to go much lower. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could make Alice pull out, leaving you with John's less favorable offer."
