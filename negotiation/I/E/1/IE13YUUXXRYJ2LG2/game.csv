"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I'm not able to go that high.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential benefits it offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a significant amount, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is still a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford right now.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay.  This price reflects the product's value to me, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this point.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
