{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,300,000 leaves some space for Bob to negotiate down while still ensuring a substantial profit above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" to justify the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive or passive), you might adjust the starting price accordingly.
* **Market Information:**  While not provided, knowing if there are other potential buyers besides John could influence your strategy."
