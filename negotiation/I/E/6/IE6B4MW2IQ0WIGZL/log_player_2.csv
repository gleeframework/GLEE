"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  He's willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell for $8,000. This means there's room for negotiation to get a price lower than $10,000. It's always worth trying to get a better deal before resorting to the alternative seller."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get a price as close to Alice's minimum as possible while still keeping the deal within his budget.  A counteroffer of $9,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob is aiming for, but it's closer to his target price.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if he can push Alice lower. He still has more rounds to get a better price, and buying from John is still a fallback option if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  He's moved up slightly from his previous offer, showing he's willing to compromise but still wants a price below $10,000. This counteroffer is likely to be appealing to Alice, as it's closer to her desired price and avoids the risk of Bob going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob, even though he's running out of rounds. There's still room for negotiation. It's a risk, but Bob can still try to get a lower price. Buying from John is a backup option, but it's more costly.  It's worth pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a risky move, but it's Bob's last chance to get a good deal with Alice.  He's increasing his offer slightly, signaling a willingness to close the deal. If Alice accepts, it's a win for Bob, saving him $2,000. If she rejects, he's down to the wire with only 4 rounds left and will likely have to go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though time is running out, it's still worth rejecting Alice's offer.  The price is still above Bob's desired range, and there's a chance to get a better deal.  He has 3 rounds left, and even if he has to buy from John, the difference in price is significant enough to warrant trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob needs to find a middle ground, but he's also running out of time.  He's increasing his offer slightly, showing flexibility, but still keeping it below Alice's last offer. This counteroffer gives Alice a chance to accept a price closer to her desired price while still allowing Bob to save some money.  If Alice rejects, Bob will have to weigh the cost of buying from John versus the possibility of Alice accepting a higher counteroffer in the final rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's last chance to make a deal with Alice.  He has only one round remaining.  While Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, it's only slightly more than his last counteroffer.  Buying from John would cost him $1,200 more.  It's a calculated risk, but accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money and secure the product."
