"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, my budget is limited. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,200,000? I believe we might be able to find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for countering.  While $1,500,000 represents a fair valuation of the product's potential, I understand budget considerations are real.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I appreciate your offer, but my budget constraints still prevent me from accepting $1,350,000. Would you consider bringing the price down to $1,250,000? I believe this could be a mutually beneficial compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
