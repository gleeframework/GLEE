Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a fair price that is still above my minimum threshold and leaves room for negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.  If he continues to decline, I can always fall back on selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than my minimum, I'm not ready to sell just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired $110, hoping to find a middle ground. If that fails, I'll happily sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $105. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $90 is better than my absolute minimum, it's still too far below my desired price point.  I've tried to negotiate, but Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
