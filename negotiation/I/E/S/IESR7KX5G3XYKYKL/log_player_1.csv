Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate if he wants to.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're making a profit and not selling at a loss. 
* **It's a fair starting point:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate but also that you value the product. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. I'm really interested, but I'm only able to pay $125 right now. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Rejecting his offer allows me to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $125 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get closer to $135. Would you be willing to go up just a little bit? "", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly higher than Bob's offer:**  This shows I'm willing to compromise but not settling for his initial offer.
* **Still below my minimum:** It's crucial to stay above my $150 floor, and $135 gives me room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Focused on a specific number:** This provides a clear counter-offer that's easy for Bob to understand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to $135, but I'm really struggling to go higher than $130.  If we can meet in the middle there, I'm ready to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $130 is only $20 below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Possibility of further negotiation:** While $130 is my current decision, I still have the option to potentially negotiate further with Bob to get closer to my target price.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I might have to settle for John's offer of $150. 

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer at $130 seems like the best option at this time."
