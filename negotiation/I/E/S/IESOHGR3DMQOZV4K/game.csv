"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  I understand that my initial price might seem a bit high, but I assure you this product is of excellent quality. How about we meet in the middle somewhere?  Would you consider $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, but $140 is still more than I'm looking to spend. To be honest, I have a budget in mind, and I'd be willing to go up to $70 for it.  That's a fair offer considering the going rate for similar products.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  It seems we are both serious about making a deal here.  While $70 is still a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to come down to $115. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price considering its value.",115.0,Alice,5,
