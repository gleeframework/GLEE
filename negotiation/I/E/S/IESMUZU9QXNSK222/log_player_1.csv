Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from your initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we try $1,500,000? I think this is a fair price for the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a significant profit. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk negotiations stalling or Bob walking away."
