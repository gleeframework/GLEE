# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for a lower price, potentially even as low as $800,000, by negotiating with Alice.  Buying from John is only an option if the negotiation with Alice fails completely."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, $850,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $920,000. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.

Bob should reject the offer.  While $920,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still potentially get the product for a lower price by continuing to negotiate.  Buying from John is still a backup option if the negotiation with Alice fails."
