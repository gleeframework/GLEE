"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. While I understand your offer, I need to be closer to $9,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $8,750? I believe this is still a good deal for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $8,750. How about we try $8,625? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8625.0,Bob,4,
