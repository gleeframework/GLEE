"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $11,500, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to reach an agreement. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,750. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $10,875? This would allow us both to secure a good deal. Let's try to finalize this, as we're running out of time.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that we're running out of time, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,875. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer $10,750 again. I think this is the best I can do, and I hope you can meet me at this price. Let's try to finalize this deal.",10750.0,Bob,6,
