Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to start with a price of $90. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get more than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $75, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $85. This is a compromise that's still above my minimum value, but it shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I could technically get the same amount from John, I've already spent some time negotiating with Bob.  Accepting his offer now means I can finalize the deal quickly and avoid potentially going back and forth with him further."
