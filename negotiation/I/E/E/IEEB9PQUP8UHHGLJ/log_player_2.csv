# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's value. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the benefits the product can bring to your business.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing some flexibility, her ""final offer"" of $1,050,000 is still above your maximum budget and the guaranteed price from John. It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and at this point, accepting John's offer ensures you get the product without risking further negotiation or a higher final price."
