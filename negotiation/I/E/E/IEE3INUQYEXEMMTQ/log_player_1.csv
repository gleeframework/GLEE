Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, we can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Testing the waters:**  The $2,250,000 offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This allows us to gauge Bob's eagerness and potential for an even higher profit margin.
* **Room for negotiation:** The high price leaves space for negotiation.  If Bob counters, we can gradually decrease the price, aiming for the highest possible amount above our guaranteed $1,500,000."
