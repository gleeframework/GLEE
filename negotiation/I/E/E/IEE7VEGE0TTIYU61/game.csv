"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. I could consider a price of $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the product's worth.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,275,000?  That seems like a fair price that we can both be happy with.",1275000.0,Bob,4,
