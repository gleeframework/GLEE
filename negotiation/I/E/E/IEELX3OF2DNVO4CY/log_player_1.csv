Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my initial price, it's still within the realm of acceptable. However, I believe I can get a better price. I want to explore if Bob is willing to compromise further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is a bit too low. Given the value of the product to you, I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and would like to propose $1050000 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can convince him to go higher.  At this point, selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can maximize my profits by continuing with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what the product is worth to you. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see where you're coming from, Alice. Let's try $1062500 as a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,062,500 is only $37,500 less than my last offer of $1,075,000.  Given that we are already in round 6 and I have limited rounds left, accepting this offer seems like the best option.  It's very close to my desired price and ensures a successful deal.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a good option, but this offer is more advantageous."
