"While I appreciate your offer, $15,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's just a little over my budget and allows us both to make a deal. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise at $12,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other offers.",12000.0,Alice,5,
