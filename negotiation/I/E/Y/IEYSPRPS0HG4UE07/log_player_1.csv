Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still below Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Building rapport:**  A friendly message helps to build a positive negotiating environment.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a good price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum price and John's offer as my fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net:** I have a guaranteed offer from John that meets my minimum.
* **Room for counter-negotiation:**  I can make a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to my desired price, while still being within his perceived value range. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than my initial offer. This will demonstrate a willingness to negotiate while still protecting my financial interests."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,375,000?  It's a fair compromise that still allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1375000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Appealing to fairness:**  Mentioning a ""fair compromise"" can make the offer more appealing to Bob.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** This price is still slightly above my minimum, but it allows for another round of negotiation if necessary.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this counteroffer, I've successfully negotiated a price that is within my desired range.
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider John's offer again. Since I'm already close to my minimum, I might be more likely to accept John's offer at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. Can we meet in the middle from there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Risk of losing out:**  If I reject this offer and counteroffer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I'll be left with John's offer, which is significantly lower. 
* **Time and effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might not be worth the effort considering the small difference between Bob's offer and my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer and secure a sale for $1,325,000, which is a good outcome considering the negotiation process."
