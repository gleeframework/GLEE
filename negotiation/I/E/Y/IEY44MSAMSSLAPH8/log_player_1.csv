Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're guaranteed to earn more than your minimum selling price of $800,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so this leaves room for negotiation and ensures he has an incentive to accept.

This offer positions you to potentially earn a higher price while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
