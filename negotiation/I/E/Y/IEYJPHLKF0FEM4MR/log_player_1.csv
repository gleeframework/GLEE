Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth.
* **Alternative:** Letting Bob know you have other options (""list it publicly"") creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still offering Bob a price he might find reasonable given the product's value to him."
