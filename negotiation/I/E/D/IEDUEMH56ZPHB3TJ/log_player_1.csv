I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1250000. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

I'll accept Bob's offer. $1,250,000 is a good compromise, and it's still above my minimum threshold.  It's better to close the deal now and avoid further negotiation."
