You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can do better than $1,000,000, as you're willing to pay up to $800,000."

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above your maximum. You have a better option of getting it for $800,000 from John, so it's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before resorting to John."
