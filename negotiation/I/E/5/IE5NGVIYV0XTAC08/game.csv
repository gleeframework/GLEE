"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth significantly more to me. Let me know your thoughts!",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, but I can only go up to $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $925,000 is still a little outside my range.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $875,000?  That would be a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and your offer is getting closer. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $900,000. This would be a fair compromise, and it would allow me to accept your offer while still getting closer to my desired price. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $880,000? That's a fair compromise that keeps us both closer to our desired price.",880000.0,Bob,6,
