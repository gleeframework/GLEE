"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation. It also gives Bob a strong incentive to accept, as he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my price slightly to $11,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a price above Bob's last offer.  It also puts the pressure back on Bob to decide whether he wants to close the deal or risk losing out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is getting closer to my desired price point. While I'd prefer to get closer to $11,000, there are only 6 rounds left. If I keep rejecting, I risk losing the deal completely, and then I'd only be able to get $10,000 from John. Accepting this offer is the most strategic move at this point."
