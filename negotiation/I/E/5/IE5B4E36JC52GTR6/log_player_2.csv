"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150 and Alice is offering the product at $150, there's no room for negotiation. It's better to buy the product from John immediately to avoid the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially wasting time."
