,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,200,000 is far above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product, acknowledging its value but reflecting my financial constraints.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential ROI for your business.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you're passionate about this product, but $1,800,000 is still too high for me.  I'm offering $1,300,000 as a serious compromise. This reflects the product's value while acknowledging my budget.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to be flexible.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
