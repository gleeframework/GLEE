"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 just doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,250, which is a fair compromise. This is a very valuable product, and I'm confident you'll see the value in investing in it at this price. Let's close this deal!",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to offer $9,800, which is my final offer. If you can meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to go to $10,000, which is a great price for this high-quality product.  It's my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal now.",10000.0,Alice,7,
