"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a good deal for both of us and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $12,200, which is a fair price given the value of the product and my budget.  Let's meet in the middle on this.",12200.0,Bob,4,
