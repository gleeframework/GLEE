Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$18,000** is a price point that balances risk and potential reward. 
* It's significantly higher than my guaranteed $15,000 from John, giving me the chance to make a better profit. 
* However, it's not outrageously high, making it more likely Bob will consider the offer if he values the product highly. 

I'm taking a calculated risk, but I believe this offer maximizes my potential earnings while still having a reasonable chance of acceptance."
