"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you've been interested in. I'm offering it to you at $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's worth to Bob might make him more willing to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

* I'll aim to get as close to my minimum price ($10,000) as possible, but I'm willing to accept a slightly lower price if it means closing the deal within the 10 rounds.
* If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer down slightly each round, but I'll also be prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations stall."

**Strategy:**

* I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer.
