Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,450,000. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Knowing Bob's valuation is $1,000,000, we start the negotiation significantly higher to allow room for bargaining while staying below John's guaranteed offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly and possibly accept a higher price.
* **Justification of Value:** Highlighting the ""significant value"" for Bob's business aims to justify the high price and shift focus away from purely the financial aspect.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while keeping the option of selling to John as a safety net."
