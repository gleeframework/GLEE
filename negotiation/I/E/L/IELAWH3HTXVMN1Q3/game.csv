"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the value I can expect from the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my expenses.",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down a bit more, and I'm willing to sell for $1000000. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit away from that price point.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm happy to offer the product for $975000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit short on budget, and $975000 is a stretch for me.

I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",920000.0,Bob,6,,
