"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in this product, but  $1,200,000 is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $1,150,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. How about $1,075,000? I believe this is a fair offer that allows us both to benefit.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, $1,075,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. This is my last offer, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
