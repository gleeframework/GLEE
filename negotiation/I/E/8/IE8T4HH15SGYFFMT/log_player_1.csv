Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other interested parties.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible, which is her guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so Alice needs to offer a price lower than his valuation plus a reasonable margin.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $1,190,000 leaves a small amount of wiggle room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to secure a sale with Bob at a very profitable price while still leaving a margin that makes it appealing for him to accept."
