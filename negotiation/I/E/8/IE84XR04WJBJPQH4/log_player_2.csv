"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is close to my maximum, but I have room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows me to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This offer reflects a significant discount and a starting point for further negotiation."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 is a significant step away from its true value. I could be persuaded to part with it for $1,050,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my target range. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $950,000, and I have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This reflects a fair compromise and shows my commitment to a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
