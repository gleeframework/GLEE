"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Given the product's value, I'd be willing to pay $950,000. This offer reflects a significant discount and a starting point for further negotiation.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 is a significant step away from its true value. I could be persuaded to part with it for $1,050,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This reflects a fair compromise and shows my commitment to a deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
