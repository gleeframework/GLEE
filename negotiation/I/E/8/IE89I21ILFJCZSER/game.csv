"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, but $15,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,500 is still a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. Can we meet in the middle at $15,000 is too high, so how about $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to get a bit more for the product to make this worthwhile for me.  Would you be willing to do $15,250?  It's a great price for something of this value.",15250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $15,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $14,500, so how about $14,750?",14750.0,Bob,6,
