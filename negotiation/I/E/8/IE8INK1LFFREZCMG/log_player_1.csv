Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, but still below what I'm willing to accept from John. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, focusing on the product's benefits.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects, he's likely to counteroffer at a price closer to my desired price.  

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my floor of $100. 
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  I believe I can still get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **Selling to John is always an option:**  If the negotiation with Bob falls through, I can always sell to John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and I go down to $100?  It's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my minimum acceptable price ($100) and Bob's offer ($90). 
* **Appealing to fairness:** I'm framing this as a win-win situation, emphasizing that it's a good deal for both of us.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not dropping below my minimum acceptable price. 

Let's see if this counteroffer convinces Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.**  $85 is significantly lower than my desired $100, and even lower than my initial counteroffer of $100. 
* **Negotiation seems unlikely to lead to a good outcome.**  It seems like Bob is pushing for a price that's far below what I'm willing to accept. 
* **Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit.**  John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price, guaranteeing me a profit and avoiding further negotiation.

Even though I could continue to negotiate with Bob, the risk of not getting a good deal is high. Selling to John is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
