"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds immense value. While I can't disclose the exact details at this moment, I can assure you it's worth at least $1000000 to me. I'm willing to let you acquire it for $1500000. This is a price that reflects the potential value I see in the product, while leaving room for you to profit significantly. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1000000.  Consider this a chance to secure a potentially valuable asset at a price point that could yield substantial returns. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
