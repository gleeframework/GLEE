Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

It's clear Alice is very reluctant to go below $13,000.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.  At this point, cutting your losses and buying from John for $15,000 is the most financially sound decision, even if it means missing out on a slightly better deal."
