"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13,000, which is a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. However, I was thinking we could do even better than that. How about $13,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it's worth it to me.",13250.0,Alice,5,
