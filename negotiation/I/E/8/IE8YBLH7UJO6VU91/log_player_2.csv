"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's above your maximum price point of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you be willing to consider $11,000?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13,000, which is a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still above my maximum budget of $12,000. It's better than her initial offer, but I can still try to get a better deal by counteroffering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $12,500. However, I was thinking we could do even better than that. How about $13,250? It's still a great deal for you, and it's worth it to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,250 is still above my budget.  I've already rejected a higher offer from her, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  It's likely Alice won't go lower, and I don't want to risk going over my budget.  Buying from John at $12,000 is the best option to ensure I get the product within my price limit."
