Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher ($1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin for Alice.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without explicitly stating Bob's perceived value.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open-ended (""What are your thoughts?"") signaling Alice's willingness to negotiate, preventing an immediate rejection and keeping Bob engaged. 

**Worst Case Scenario:** Bob rejects the offer. Alice can then sell the product to John for her minimum acceptable price of $800,000.

**Best Case Scenario:** Bob accepts the offer, or a negotiated price closer to $1,200,000, resulting in a significant profit for Alice."
