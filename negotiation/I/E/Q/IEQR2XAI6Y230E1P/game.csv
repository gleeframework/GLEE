"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's below your initial offer and closer to my budget. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is still a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I'm very interested in the product, $1,050,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $975,000, which is a significant step towards your last offer and closer to my financial limitations. This seems like a fair compromise for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal!",975000.0,Bob,6,
