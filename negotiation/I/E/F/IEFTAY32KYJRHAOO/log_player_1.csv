Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It allows me to potentially make a good profit, but it's also reasonable enough that Bob might be willing to accept it. If he rejects, I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $140. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm willing to move a bit closer to Bob's offer, but I still need to make a decent profit.  $135 is a fair middle ground, and hopefully, Bob will see that."
