# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1100000. It's a great deal, as it's worth $1000000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested! If not, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than what John is offering, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can secure the product from John for a lower price."
