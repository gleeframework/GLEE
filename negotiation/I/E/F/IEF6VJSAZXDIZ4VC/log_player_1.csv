"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit tight on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $110, but no higher. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer of $110 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum threshold and seems like a reasonable deal for both of us. I'll accept his offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John at a lower price."
