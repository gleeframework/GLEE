Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I believe it will be very valuable to you, but I'm willing to offer a small discount."",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's very interested, while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts outright.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup buyer at $120 gives you leverage.  You're not desperate to sell to Bob below your minimum."
