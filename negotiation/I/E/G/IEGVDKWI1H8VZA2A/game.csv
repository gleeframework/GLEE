"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $1,000,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $950,000. It's a fair price, considering the value this product can bring to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $950,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? I'm confident that this price would be mutually beneficial.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not quite ready to meet in the middle just yet. I'm willing to come down to $920,000, but I think it's worth more than that. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
