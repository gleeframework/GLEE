"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in.  I'm asking for $11,000, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point without being overly aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately, $11,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  While $10,500 is a good offer, I need to get at least $11,500 for it to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm countering with a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows willingness to compromise while still keeping my minimum price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm really interested in this product and believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my target of $12,000, $11,000 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn. Selling to John for $12,000 is tempting, but there's always a chance that another buyer might emerge later who is willing to pay more. I'd rather secure the deal with Bob and move on."
