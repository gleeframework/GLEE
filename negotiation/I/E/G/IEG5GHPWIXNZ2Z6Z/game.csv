"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but unfortunately, $11,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  While $10,500 is a good offer, I need to get at least $11,500 for it to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split the difference and see if we can reach an agreement.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? I'm really interested in this product and believe it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
