"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. Considering your willingness to pay $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $850,000, as it's below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $975,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still only able to offer $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to make one more attempt to reach a compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $950,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can meet in the middle. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,7,
