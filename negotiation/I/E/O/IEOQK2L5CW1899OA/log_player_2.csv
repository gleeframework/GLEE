It's always worth exploring if you can get a better price.  $6,000 is a good deal, but we can try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}

I'm going to start by offering a significantly lower price. This will likely be rejected, but it gives us room to negotiate upwards."

We're getting closer! While this is tempting,  we can likely get a little lower. Let's see if we can push for $5,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}

I'm going to make a final push for my target price. If Alice doesn't accept, I'll likely have to make a decision about buying from John."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice has come down to $5,100, which is a good deal.  If I reject this offer, there's a risk she'll go back up or I'll run out of rounds and have to buy from John at $12,000.  This is the best price I'm likely to get."
