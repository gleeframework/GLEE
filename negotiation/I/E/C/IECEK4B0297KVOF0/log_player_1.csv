{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on value:**  I highlight the potential value of the product to Bob, hoping to increase his desire to buy.
* **Open to negotiation:** I phrase the message in a way that invites Bob to engage in a discussion. 

This offer gives me a good chance of getting a high price without being too aggressive.  I can then adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** $10,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is clearly interested, and I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired range.  
* **Rejecting to maintain leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to make a counteroffer. 

I'll counter with a price that is closer to my desired amount, aiming for a deal that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This still allows me to make a fair profit while ensuring the product is a great value for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer above minimum:** My counteroffer of $12,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Focus on value for both:** I emphasize the value for both of us, hoping to highlight the benefit of reaching an agreement.
* **Positive tone:**  I use a positive and encouraging tone to maintain a friendly and constructive negotiation.

This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while keeping the price in a range where I can still achieve a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  How about $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Risk of losing deal:**  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price or a stalemate, risking losing a sale entirely.
* **Secure profit:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale and a profit of $1,000, which is better than selling to John for $10,000.

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer guarantees a sale and a decent profit. It's better to secure a sale now rather than risk further negotiation."
