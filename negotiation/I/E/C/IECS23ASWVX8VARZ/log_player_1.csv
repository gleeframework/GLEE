Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's capabilities and potential benefits to my business. I'm willing to move forward with the purchase at this price.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 doesn't fully reflect the product's true value and potential for your business.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725000. I believe this price reflects a fair value for the product and its potential benefits to my business.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is coming closer to my preferred price, I'm still not willing to settle. I believe I can get a bit more, especially considering John is ready to pay $800,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if I can close the gap further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $725,000 still doesn't quite meet my expectations for this exceptional product.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm prepared to go down to $775,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $775000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $750000, which I believe is a fair price for the product's value and potential benefits to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Bob's offer is just $25,000 below John's offer, I'm still not willing to settle yet. I've come down a considerable amount, and I want to see if I can get Bob to budge just a bit more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $775,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and we're clearly getting closer to a deal.  While $750,000 is tempting, it's just a little short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile. I'm prepared to go down to $760,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and it still provides you with a great deal on a product that will deliver tremendous value to your business.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid $760000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $750000, as I mentioned before. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value and potential benefits to my business. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is only $10,000 higher than John's offer of $800,000.  Considering that I've come down a considerable amount and Bob seems unlikely to budge further, it's not worth the risk of rejecting his offer and potentially ending up with nothing.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and is the more secure choice at this point."
