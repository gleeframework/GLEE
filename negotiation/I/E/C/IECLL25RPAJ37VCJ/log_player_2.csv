"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We want to give ourselves room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $150 maximum.
* **Polite & Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's offer while clearly stating our price target. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will help us gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room:** While Alice moved closer to our range, $125 is still above her value ($120). 
* **Negotiating Leverage:** We have rounds to spare, and John's offer at $150 gives us a fallback option. Alice seems willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $110 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $117? That's a fair price for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 117
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're demonstrating willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Alice's price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $117 keeps us below our $150 limit, leaves room for one more small increase if needed, and is still a good deal if accepted. 
* **Positive Framing:**  By calling it a ""fair price for both of us,"" we aim to make the offer more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $117 is still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $120? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** Alice has come down to her value of $120. It's unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **Excellent Deal:** This price is well below our $150 maximum and a great price for the product. 
* **No Guarantee of Improvement:** Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal, and we might not get a better price from Alice."
