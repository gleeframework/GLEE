"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $140 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a great deal for you, as the product is worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $110 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $117? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",117.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $117 is still a bit low for me. How about we compromise at $120? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's close this deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
