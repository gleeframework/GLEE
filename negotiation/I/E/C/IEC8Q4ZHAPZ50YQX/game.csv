"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $12,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would that be feasible?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,000 is cutting it too close.  How about we settle at $12,000 even? That's my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
