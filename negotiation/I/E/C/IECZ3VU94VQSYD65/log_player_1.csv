Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage. Starting at $2,000,000 aims high with the possibility of Bob accepting or negotiating down.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" aims to justify the high price, even if those benefits aren't explicitly stated in the prompt.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains friendly and open-ended (""Let me know what you think!"") to encourage a counter-offer from Bob if he's not immediately sold.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes some risk tolerance. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer outright, leading you to John (your guaranteed sale). However, the potential for a higher profit with Bob makes this a calculated risk."
