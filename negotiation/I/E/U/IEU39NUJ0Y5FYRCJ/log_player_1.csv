Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it allows for some negotiating room. I believe Bob might be willing to pay a premium for the product, and I want to see if he's interested at this price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to accept such a huge loss. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, this shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a respectable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum value. I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $11,000. This is a compromise, but it's closer to my ideal price than Bob's last offer. I hope this shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  The negotiation isn't going anywhere, and I'm risking losing time and potentially getting a worse offer from Bob.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000."
