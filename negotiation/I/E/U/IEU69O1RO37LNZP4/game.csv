"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. While $2,000,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
