Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum value ($100), but lower than Bob's maximum value ($120). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not desperate. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I can always sell to John for $100 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher price than his offer, but still significantly less than my initial offer. This shows good faith and willingness to negotiate, but also keeps the price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge from his $100 offer.  While I could keep negotiating, there's a chance this will go on indefinitely.  I've already reached my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing time and potentially getting a lower price than John is offering.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum and avoid further negotiation."
