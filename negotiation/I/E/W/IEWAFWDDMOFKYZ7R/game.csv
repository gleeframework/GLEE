,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me there?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest! $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? It's still a great deal for a product you value at $100, and it gives us both room to make a deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95? That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here.  $92 is really close, but I'm only willing to go down to $94. This is my final offer, and if you reject it, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",94.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $91 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",91.0,Bob,8,
