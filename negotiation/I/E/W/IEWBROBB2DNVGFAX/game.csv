"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $18000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to discussing this.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $16500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $15500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,
