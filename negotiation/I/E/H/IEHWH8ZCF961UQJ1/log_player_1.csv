"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation. This also sets the tone for me being the seller with the upper hand, potentially leading to a better deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my budget. How about $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to go that low yet. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to offer it for $8,250. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $8000 as the final price for the product. This aligns closely with my budget and I believe it's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, and it aligns with what I can get from John. Accepting his offer secures the deal and avoids further negotiation."
