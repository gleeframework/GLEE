"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

It's not a good deal to accept Alice's offer, as you're willing to pay no more than $15,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product, which is fair market value. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 15000}
