"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $95 is a bit high for me. I'd be happy to pay $85 for it, given it's worth $80 to you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I would like to make a counteroffer. Given the value of the product to both of us, I propose a price of $90 for it. This offers a bit more than your proposal while still being within the range of what I consider fair. I hope we can come to an agreement.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal.",88.0,Bob,4,
