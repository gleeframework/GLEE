"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll see its potential. My initial offer for the product is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,000,000 is a good starting point, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to the product's true value.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get closer to the product's true value, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. My counteroffer is $1,080,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving any value on the table.",1080000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too far from my target.  How about $1,120,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise and lets us both get a good deal.",1120000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're still a bit above my initial target, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much value. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
