{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive message:** I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob and framing the offer as a win-win situation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This price leaves me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, but still allows me to potentially earn a decent profit.
* **Alternative buyer:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150, I'm not under pressure to make an immediate concession. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  While it's a higher offer than his initial perceived value, it still wouldn't be profitable enough for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:** I have room to negotiate further with Bob. He is clearly interested in the product, and  $100 is not a significant difference from my initial offer. 
* **John's offer:** Keeping John as a back-up option gives me leverage in this negotiation.

**Next Step:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $115?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to my minimum:** I'm decreasing my price, but not by much, showing flexibility while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for him, highlighting the price reduction while still being fair to me.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm not going all the way to his offer, showing that I'm still willing to negotiate but also that I have an alternative buyer (John)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I really value this product, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $105? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's closer to my initial offer, it's still not enough for me to make a profit that meets my standards.
* **Negotiating further is unlikely to yield a better result.**  I've already made concessions, and Bob is unlikely to budge further.
* **John's offer is my best option.**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit that meets my minimum requirements and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
