"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $115?  That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I really value this product, but I'm still looking to keep my expenses within my budget. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $105? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
