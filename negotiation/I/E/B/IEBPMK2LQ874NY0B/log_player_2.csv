"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $11,500, which is a great deal considering its worth to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy the product from John for his maximum price."
