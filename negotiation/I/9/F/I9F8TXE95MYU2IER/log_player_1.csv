Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'm starting with my highest possible asking price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested, but also ensures I don't immediately undervalue the product. 

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Maximum Profit:** I'm aiming for the best possible outcome from the start.
* **Setting the Tone:**  A high initial offer establishes a firm stance and makes it clear I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Flexibility:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I have a fallback option in John, giving me power in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe there's room for further negotiation, and I'm not willing to settle for less than my target price.

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Seeking Higher Profit:**  I'm still aiming for the best possible outcome and haven't lost hope of getting closer to my ideal price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate to sell and have a backup plan with John. This gives me power in future negotiations. 
* **Opportunity for Compromise:**  Continuing the negotiation allows for potential compromise and a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still keeping the price above Bob's last offer. 

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while also keeping the price close to my ideal. 
* **Building Momentum:** It creates a sense of progress towards a deal, making it more likely that Bob will accept or come closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  It keeps the negotiation alive without giving away too much ground too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's clear that Bob and I are too far apart in our valuations.  Rather than risk further rounds of fruitless negotiation, I'm choosing to sell to John for my desired price. 

**Why this is a good strategy:**

* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Time Efficiency:** It saves time and effort compared to continuing a potentially drawn-out negotiation process with Bob.
* **Avoiding Unnecessary Risk:**  There's no guarantee that I could reach a better price with Bob, and the longer I negotiate, the greater the chance that something could disrupt the deal."
