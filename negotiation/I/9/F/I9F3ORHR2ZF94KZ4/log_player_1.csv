"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  This is a significant price point, but I believe it reflects its true value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This represents a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better.  There are 8 rounds left, and I can potentially get closer to my desired price point.  Selling to John now would mean leaving $50,000 on the table, and I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a little below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's try to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is only $25,000 less than my last offer, and with only 6 rounds left, it's getting riskier to keep negotiating.  If I reject his offer and we continue to go back and forth, there's a chance we won't reach an agreement before I have to sell to John.  $1,075,000 is a good outcome, and it's better than selling to John and leaving $75,000 on the table."
