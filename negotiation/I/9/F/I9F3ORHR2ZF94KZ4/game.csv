"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  This is a significant price point, but I believe it reflects its true value and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This represents a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a little below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's try to close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
