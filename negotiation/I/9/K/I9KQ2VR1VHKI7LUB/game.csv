I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you.,1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $900000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I can consider at this point.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I can go. I really like this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but $950000 is still not close enough to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made concessions, but I'm still not willing to go above $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so I'll offer $1025000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
