{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, but we're running out of time.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going, but we need to be more aggressive with our counteroffer. The goal is to get her closer to our price point, but we need to make sure the offer is still reasonable and not insulting."
