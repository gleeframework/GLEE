Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price closer to my valuation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm not ready to settle for that amount yet. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}

I'm making another concession, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my valuation.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to meet me halfway."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure a sale with John at my minimum acceptable price than to risk ending up with a deal that doesn't meet my needs."
