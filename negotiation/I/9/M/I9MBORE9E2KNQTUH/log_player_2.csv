"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase my product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $10,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. Therefore, rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round to counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $10,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Lower:** Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so starting with a lower counteroffer of $7,500 is a good strategy. This leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Clear Communication:** The message emphasizes Bob's interest while clearly stating his price point.
* **Remaining within Budget:** The offer is still within Bob's $8,000 limit, making it a viable option."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob can still attempt to negotiate a lower price. There's room for a counteroffer that might be more acceptable to both parties. 
* **Avoiding Jhon:** Buying from Jhon at $8,000 is an option, but it's still worthwhile to see if Bob can secure a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a higher price. Let's try $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  Bob is now offering a price that is closer to Alice's offer and is also within his budget.
* **Showing Flexibility:** The message indicates Bob's willingness to compromise and meet Alice halfway.
* **Emphasizing Value:** Bob highlights the product's value to justify his offer.
* **Closing the Deal:** The message expresses Bob's readiness to finalize the purchase if Alice accepts."
