"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in moving forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering and negotiating. There are 10 rounds, so there is time to explore better options.  Buying from John immediately would be less profitable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price is closer to my valuation and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in moving forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's valuation, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  He has 8 rounds left, which gives him time to explore lower prices.  Also, buying from John immediately would cost the same as Alice's offer, so there's no immediate benefit to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This price aligns with my valuation and allows for a fair profit for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your valuation, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a reasonable profit. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in moving forward with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and there are only 5 rounds left.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This ensures he gets the product at his target price and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not lead to a better outcome within the remaining rounds."
