"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John:** You value the product at $120, and Alice is selling it for $100. This means you save $20 compared to buying from John.
* **Even though the product is worth $80 to Alice, it's irrelevant to your decision:** You are only concerned with the price you pay and your own valuation of the product."
