Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

We're still significantly below John's offer. It's time to push Bob a bit harder to see how much he's truly willing to pay."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still quite a way from what I consider a fair price for this product.  To move things along, I'm willing to accept $1,175,000. This is my final offer."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,175,000, so how about $1,137,500?

We're getting closer, but we're still leaving money on the table compared to John's offer.  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can push him a little further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:

``` 

We're in the final rounds of negotiation, and Bob is inching closer to our desired price.  We're still below John's offer, so it's worth seeing if we can squeeze out a bit more from Bob."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're so close to a deal! I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,175,000? This is my final offer. It's a fantastic deal for a product you won't find anywhere else."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:** We are down to the last two rounds, and we need to push Bob towards a final decision. 
* **Firm but Fair:** By stating it's our final offer, we convey seriousness and urgency.  
* **Highlighting Value:**  We remind Bob about the product's unique value proposition to justify the price. 
* **John as Backup:** We still have the option to fall back on John's offer if Bob rejects this final attempt."

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but no higher. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is unlikely to budge:** Bob has remained firm at $1,150,000, even with our ""final offer"" in the previous round. 
* **Time has run out:**  This is the last round, leaving no room for further negotiation. 
* **Guaranteed profit:** John's standing offer of $1,200,000 guarantees a higher profit than Bob's final offer of $1,150,000.

While we could have potentially squeezed a bit more out of Bob with additional rounds, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point. It's time to take the guaranteed profit and move on."
