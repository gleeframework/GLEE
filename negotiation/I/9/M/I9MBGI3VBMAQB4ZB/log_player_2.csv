"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $120 to her, so I'm sure she's making a profit on this sale. I'd rather try to negotiate further or buy it from John for $100.
