# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. Let's start with a price of $900000. I'm confident that you'll find this a fair and reasonable offer.

# Alice's message: I understand that $750000 is a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $850000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise.
