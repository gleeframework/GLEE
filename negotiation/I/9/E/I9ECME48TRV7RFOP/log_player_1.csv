{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's significantly closer to my target of $100 while still leaving room for potential counteroffers. I'm confident this will start a productive conversation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still far from the $100 value Bob places on the product. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $90 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $87.50. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer $90, $87.50 is a good compromise. It's closer to my target price than selling to John, and Bob seems committed to buying the product at this price.  I'm happy to close the deal."
