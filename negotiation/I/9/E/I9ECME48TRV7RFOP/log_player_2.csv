"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can do better than $95. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $85? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in the product."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than $95, you can still potentially get a better price. It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can close the gap further."
