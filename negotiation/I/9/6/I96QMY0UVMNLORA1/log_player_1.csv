"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement that is beneficial for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $120 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as the product is worth that much to me.  There's no point in continuing negotiations as I won't get a better price from Bob.  Selling to John would get me the same price, but accepting Bob's offer is quicker and avoids the risk of a potential breakdown in negotiations."
