Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (your own valuation and John's offer), you have room to start high. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers to justify the high price.
* **Urgency:**  The ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer.  There's a chance he might try to negotiate a lower price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Starting at $2,000,000 carries the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. You need to weigh this risk against the potential reward of securing a higher sale price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Bob."
