Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a decent starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm hoping Bob sees value in the product and is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  $50 is nowhere near my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price to $175. This is still a good price for me, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and try one more time to find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $160. This is getting closer to Bob's offer, and I'm hoping it will be enough to reach a deal.  I'm not willing to go lower than this, as it's getting too close to my minimum acceptable price."
