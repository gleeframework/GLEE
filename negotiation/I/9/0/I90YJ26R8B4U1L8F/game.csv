"Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but I believe you're undervaluing the potential of this product. It offers unique benefits that go beyond typical market offerings, potentially saving you significant costs and generating new revenue streams in the long run.  To demonstrate my commitment to closing a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to make a deal, but I'm still not convinced that the product's benefits justify a price higher than $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a deal at this price, but I need to be comfortable with the cost.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
