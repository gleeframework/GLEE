"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses positive language to highlight the product's value and encourages Bob to engage in the discussion.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I've made it clear this is a ""starting price"" to signal my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above my minimum selling price, but it's still significantly lower than my initial ask. I believe there's room for negotiation to bridge the gap. Selling to John would be a last resort at this point, as I'm confident I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I believe the product is worth significantly more than that.  Would you consider a price of $1,950,000? This reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've come down from my initial ask, but not too drastically.  This counter-offer still keeps the price point well above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm reiterating the product's value to encourage Bob to see it from my perspective. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will help me gauge Bob's flexibility and determine our next steps in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,800,000. Can you consider this compromise? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a strong deal. It's significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and shows he's willing to compromise. While I could try to push for more, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
