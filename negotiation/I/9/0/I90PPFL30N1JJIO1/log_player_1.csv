Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is a bit lower than what I believe the product is worth to Bob, but still gives me a good profit margin. I'm also being friendly and inviting in my message to encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I want to try and get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $12,500 is a bit low for you, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $13,000? That's the highest I can go for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a good price. It's higher than John's offer of $12,000 and it's getting close to what I think the product is worth to Bob. I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn, so I'll accept his offer."
