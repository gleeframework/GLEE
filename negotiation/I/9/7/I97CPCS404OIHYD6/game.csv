"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $120. Would you be willing to come down to $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but $130 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $155. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $140 for the product, which is a fair compromise and within my budget. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in the negotiation process. I understand that $140 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $145. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. How about we split the difference and settle on $142.50? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",142.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not comfortable with $142.50. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $145, which is my previous offer. I can offer it to you for $142.50, but I need to make a small profit, so I'll stick with $142.75. Let me know if that works for you.",142.75,Alice,7,
