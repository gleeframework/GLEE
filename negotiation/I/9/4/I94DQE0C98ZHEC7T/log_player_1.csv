Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $140. I believe it's of great value and would be perfect for you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $140 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially increasing your profit. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** $140 is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring a good profit. 

By starting high but still within a reasonable range of Bob's valuation, you increase the likelihood of a successful sale at a price that benefits you most."
