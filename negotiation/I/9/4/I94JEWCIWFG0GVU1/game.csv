"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000? This price still leaves room for profit for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it to you. ",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,450,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to an agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go down to $1,500,000, but that's my final offer. This product is truly valuable, and I believe it will be a great investment for you. Let's seal the deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
