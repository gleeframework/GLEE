"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  He has room to negotiate and should see if he can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  However,  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $11,500. This is the best I can do at this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's target price, he still has room to negotiate.  He has 7 rounds left and can likely get a better deal if he continues to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  However, $11,500 is still slightly higher than what I'm prepared to pay.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $11,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, so let me know if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $11,500. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I can offer the product to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been steadily lowering the price, and Alice has shown a willingness to meet him halfway.  $11,250 is a good price for Bob, considering his goal of saving money.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially get a lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away and Bob having to buy from John at a much higher price is too high.  Accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point."
