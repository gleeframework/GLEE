"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can't afford $12,000. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget. However, $9,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a great deal.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I've been thinking about it and I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. It's the highest I can afford. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. While $10,000 is getting closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's my absolute lowest.  Let's see if we can close this deal. ",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate you coming up to $10,500.  However, I need to get at least $11,000 for this to work for me.  This would still be a great deal for you, as you're getting a high-quality product for a fair price.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground to finalize this sale.",11000.0,Alice,7,
