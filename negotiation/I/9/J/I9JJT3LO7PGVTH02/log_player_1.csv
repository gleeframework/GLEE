"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Building Rapport:** I'm trying to build a positive relationship by highlighting the product's value and expressing confidence in Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm inviting Bob to engage in a conversation by asking for his opinion, indicating a willingness to negotiate.

This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while also setting the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I can't afford $12,000. I am willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There are still 9 rounds left. I believe I can continue negotiating with Bob and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I can't reach a better deal with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I am holding out for a better deal without jeopardizing my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget. However, $9,000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a great deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price from $12,000 to $10,500, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm framing my offer as a fair deal for both of us, highlighting my costs while emphasizing the value Bob will receive.
* **Open to Further Negotiation:** I'm again ending with a question to encourage continued dialogue and potential for a final agreement.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully lead to a successful deal in the upcoming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've been thinking about it and I'm willing to go up to $10,000 for the product. It's the highest I can afford. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $10,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **John's offer is a strong safety net:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit and significantly more than Bob's offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There are still several rounds left. I believe I can push for a higher price with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and continue to aim for a better deal. While I'm willing to consider John's offer if I can't reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob, I'm not ready to settle for less than my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. While $10,000 is getting closer, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's my absolute lowest.  Let's see if we can close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway Again:** I'm bridging the gap by offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's current offer ($10,000).
* **Setting a Limit:** I'm emphasizing that $11,000 is my absolute lowest, creating a sense of urgency and finality.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using language like ""Let's see if we can close this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the transaction.

This counteroffer aims to find a price that is both acceptable to Bob and allows me to make a good profit. It also creates a sense of urgency to push Bob towards a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Even though Bob has increased his offer, $10,500 is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.
* **John's offer is a strong safety net:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit and significantly more than Bob's current offer.
* **Negotiation can continue:** There are still 4 rounds left. I believe I can potentially push for a higher price with Bob, or at least maintain this current offer for another round.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm maintaining my leverage and continuing to aim for a better deal. While I'm not opposed to selling to John, I'm still hopeful that I can achieve a more profitable outcome with Bob."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate you coming up to $10,500.  However, I need to get at least $11,000 for this to work for me.  This would still be a great deal for you, as you're getting a high-quality product for a fair price.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground to finalize this sale."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000, but I'm framing it as a compromise and emphasizing the value Bob will receive.
* **Seeking a Middle Ground:** I'm using language like ""find a middle ground"" to suggest a potential solution that benefits both of us.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality and the attractive price he's getting, reinforcing the benefits of closing the deal.

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while also reminding Bob of the benefits of buying the product at my price. I'm aiming to reach a deal in this round but am still prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've done some research and found out that similar products are being sold for around $9,500. Based on that information, I'm willing to pay $10,000 for your product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We are in round 8, with only two rounds left.  
* **Bob's offer is getting lower:** Bob is now offering $10,000, which is less than his previous offer.  This indicates that he may not be willing to go higher.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed win:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer. It's more than my minimum and secures a significant profit.

By selling to John, I am maximizing my profit and avoiding further negotiation with Bob.  While I'm open to a better deal with Bob, the risk of getting a lower price or not reaching an agreement in the limited remaining rounds outweighs the potential upside."
