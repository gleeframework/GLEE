"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this product for a price that's still a great deal for both of us. Consider this: it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for less than that.  Let's find a price that works for us both.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to gauge how much you value the product. Her message hints that she's willing to go lower than $15,000 but doesn't reveal her lowest acceptable price. By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're looking for a significantly better deal while still leaving room for her to counter-offer."
