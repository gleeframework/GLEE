"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is quite steep. This product fits my needs, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Beginning with a significantly lower offer allows room for negotiation and helps gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Respectful Tone:** While the counteroffer is significantly lower, maintaining a polite and respectful tone is important for a positive negotiation. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning a budget, Bob provides a reason for the lower offer without revealing his absolute maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you meet me halfway at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to a more reasonable price, $12,000 is still above both your target price and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation to potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,000 is closer, but it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That feels like a fair price to me."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer proposes a price directly between Alice's previous offer and Bob's last offer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness Appeal:** By framing $10,000 as a ""fair price,"" Bob subtly reinforces that this is his target and potentially Alice's best offer. 
* **John's Offer as Leverage:** While not explicitly stated, having John's offer of $10,000 provides a strong backup option for Bob. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob can confidently purchase from John without further negotiation."
