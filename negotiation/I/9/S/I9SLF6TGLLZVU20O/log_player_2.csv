"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. It's a fair price that allows for a substantial return on your investment. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy the product from John and save $100,000."
