"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit high for my budget. This product would be great, but  I'm only willing to go as high as $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to find a deal that works for both of us. Could you meet me halfway at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $15,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
