Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your desired price sets a firm anchor for the negotiation.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While the message is firm, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested. 
* **No Room for Loss:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything â€“ you'll still sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
