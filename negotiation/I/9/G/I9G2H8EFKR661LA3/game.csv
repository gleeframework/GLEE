"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would give you a good deal, and still allow me to get a fair price. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $10,000. Can we meet at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
