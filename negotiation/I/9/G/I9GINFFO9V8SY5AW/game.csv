"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is a significant compromise from my initial price. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is still a little too low for me.  To show you my commitment to making this work, I'm willing to meet you at $11,000. This is a significant compromise for me, but I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let me know if you're ready to finalize this deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,6,
