"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth $10,000 to you, and to be fair, I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a reasonable range and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, however,  $7,000 is significantly below its value. Could you do $8,800? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from a price I'm happy with. It's worth another counter-offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,800?"",
""product_price"": 7800
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer aims to split the difference between Alice's last offer ($8,800) and my previous counter-offer ($7,000). This is often a good negotiation tactic as it suggests fairness. 
* **Testing the Waters:** It allows us to gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be. If she accepts, great! If not, we still have room to maneuver. 
* **Staying Below John's Price:** It's important to remember that our absolute ceiling is $10,000 (John's price). We want to stay well below that to ensure we're getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're right, we should try to meet in the middle. However, $7,800 is still quite low for me.  Would you be willing to do $8,500?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Slow Concession:** While Alice is moving towards a more agreeable price, her concessions are getting smaller.  This suggests she might be getting closer to her bottom line.
* **Room for Negotiation:** We still have five rounds left and are below John's price. There's room to push a bit further. 
* **Aiming Lower:** Ideally, we want to get the price closer to $8,000, which is still a significant saving over John's offer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  It seems like we're getting close. How about $8,100? That's a significant step from my previous offer."",
""product_price"": 8100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're offering a slightly larger increase this time ($300 instead of $200) to signal that we're serious about reaching a deal. 
* **Targeting a Sweet Spot:** $8,100 is a price point that's significantly closer to Alice's likely bottom line ($8,000) while still leaving us with a good deal compared to John's offer.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  Continuing to negotiate keeps the pressure on Alice and shows her that we're determined to find a mutually agreeable price."
