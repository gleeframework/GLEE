"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, however,  $7,000 is significantly below its value. Could you do $8,800?",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, you're right, we should try to meet in the middle. However, $7,800 is still quite low for me.  Would you be willing to do $8,500?  That's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,5,
