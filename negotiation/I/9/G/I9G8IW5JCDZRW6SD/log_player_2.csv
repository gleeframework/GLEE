"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the goal is to save as much money as possible, accepting the initial offer is not the best strategy. It's worth exploring if a better price can be negotiated with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by proposing a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. It's important to set a strong starting point and see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $10,000 is still within the budget limit, but it leaves room for further negotiations if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer, but I need to get a bit closer to my desired price. Would you consider $12500? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, it's still higher than my preferred starting point. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate further before accepting. I'm going to make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  This would give us both a fair deal, and I'd be happy to move forward."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to push for a lower price while still acknowledging Alice's concessions. Offering to split the difference creates a sense of compromise and fairness, making it more likely that Alice will accept."
