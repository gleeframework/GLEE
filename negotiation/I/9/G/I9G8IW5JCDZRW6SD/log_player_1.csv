"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is my minimum, I know the product is worth more.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and try to get a better price.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as there's still potential to get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I need to get a bit closer to my desired price. Would you consider $12,500? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12500 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and go with $11250?  This would give us both a fair deal, and I'd be happy to move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,250 is a good compromise and is closer to my desired price than my minimum. At this point, I'm willing to accept and close the deal.  While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal to John or further negotiation stalling is not worth it."
