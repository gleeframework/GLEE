"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price a bit higher than Bob's perceived value ($150) to see if there's room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and open to his input."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $140 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 160}
``` 
I'm counteroffering with a price closer to Bob's value but still above my minimum.  I'm hoping to reach a compromise quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $145. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below it.  I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $152.50?  That way we both get a fair price. "", ""product_price"": 152.50}
``` 

I'm offering a price that's right in the middle between my minimum and Bob's last offer. I'm hoping that this will be a good compromise and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $152.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $147. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $147. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $147
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This is a difficult choice, but with only 4 rounds left, the negotiation is taking longer than expected, and I'm not confident that Bob will reach my minimum price.  It's better to sell to John now and guarantee a price that meets my minimum."
