You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal. It's possible Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to save $200,000. This initial offer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate seriously while also setting a clear expectation for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but there's still potential for further savings. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise. The $1,100,000 offer is a reasonable compromise that potentially bridges the gap between Bob's desired price and Alice's offer.  It keeps the negotiation moving while leaving room for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice has come down to $1,125,000, which is a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or not budging further increases. It's now a good deal for Bob, and accepting minimizes the risk of losing the product entirely."
