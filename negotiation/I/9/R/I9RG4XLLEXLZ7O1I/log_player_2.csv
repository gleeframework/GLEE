Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, $900,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000, which is still a significant discount from the product's true value to you. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits you'll get from owning this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's worth to me, and I think it's a good starting point for a deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to consider $825,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to negotiating further. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he'd prefer a lower price, $825,000 is a good deal considering the product's value to him.  He's already negotiated down significantly from the initial offer, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal.  He's also halfway through the rounds, and the risk of not reaching a deal is higher."
