"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $850000, which is a significant discount from my original price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $850000 is getting closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $750000. How about we split the difference and settle on $800000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still think $800000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Let's see if we can make it work.",825000.0,Alice,5,
