"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm keeping in mind that I can always go down to $120 if Bob doesn't accept.  Let's see what he's willing to pay!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$60 is way too low. I'm not willing to accept that.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still keeping it above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable price and be willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hopeful that Bob will come up a little more. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not happy with $90. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a little more from Bob. If not, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

This is my final counteroffer. If Bob doesn't accept, I'm going to sell to John.  $100 is a fair price for both of us, and I'm not willing to go lower."
