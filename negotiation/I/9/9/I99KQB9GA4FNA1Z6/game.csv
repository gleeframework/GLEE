"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  While $950,000 is tempting, it's a bit below my minimum expectation.  Let's compromise: I'm willing to reduce the price to $1,050,000. This is a fair price given the value of this product and allows for both of us to gain.  What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I truly value the product, but I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,025,000. This is a significant reduction from your last offer, yet still higher than what I am willing to pay. I hope we can reach an agreement that is fair for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While your offer of $1,025,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping for a little more. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $1,040,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a successful deal. Let's find common ground and finalize this.",1040000.0,Alice,5,
