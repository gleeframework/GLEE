Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I know Bob values the product. I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a premium to get it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is a bit lower than I'd like, but it's close. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $10,500. This is still above my minimum and hopefully closer to a price we can both agree on."

Bob's offer is getting lower and lower. While I could keep negotiating, I'm not sure he's willing to get much closer to my target price.  John is a guaranteed sale at $10,000, which is my minimum, so I'm going to sell to him."
