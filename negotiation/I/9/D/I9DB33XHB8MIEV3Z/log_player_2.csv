"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is still higher than his maximum budget of $12,000 but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $14,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate further while still maintaining a strong position. This counteroffer also signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but is unwilling to pay Alice's asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $12,500 is unfortunately below my minimum selling price.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500 to make this deal work.  Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it is still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. He can still try to negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer. It is also important to remember that Bob can always buy the product from John for $12,000, so he has a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer from $12,500 to $13,000, showing a willingness to compromise.  He's stating that this is his final offer, creating a sense of urgency and potentially pushing Alice to accept.  This strategy aims to reach a compromise without exceeding Bob's budget limit."
