Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is higher than Bob's value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and emphasizing the value the product offers to Bob. This can help build rapport and make him more likely to consider the offer.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a higher price, I can potentially get closer to my desired price while leaving room for Bob to counteroffer. This strategy allows for negotiation and hopefully leads to a mutually beneficial agreement. I am prepared to walk away if Bob's counteroffer isn't acceptable, knowing I have another buyer willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial value, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to accept anything less than that. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer and attempt to get closer to my desired price.  I'm still considering selling to John for $15,000, but I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, $12,500 is unfortunately below my minimum selling price.  I'm willing to go down to $13,500 to make this deal work.  Let me know if this is acceptable."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  My counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my original price, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Message:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone and emphasizing the potential benefit of a partnership.  I'm also reiterating my minimum price point, subtly reinforcing the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  By meeting Bob halfway, I hope to reach an agreement that is favorable for both of us.
* **Keep the negotiation alive:**  By remaining open to a deal, I prevent the negotiation from collapsing while simultaneously demonstrating my commitment to a fair price.
* **Maintain leverage:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not desperate, reminding Bob that I have another buyer ready to purchase at my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to continue negotiating, I've already made a significant concession and there's a risk that further negotiation will only result in a lower price. 

**Strategy:**

It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John than to risk a further decline in price with Bob.  By selling to John, I can avoid the potential for a prolonged negotiation that might not result in a better outcome."
