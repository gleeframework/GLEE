"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to accept $8,250.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $7,500, so I'd like to offer $7,750. Can we meet at this price?",7750.0,Bob,4,
