"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to let it go for $15000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to try and negotiate, especially since you have a clear alternative with John.  Rejecting the initial offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It demonstrates a willingness to buy, but also sets a firm starting point for your bargaining position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you in the middle at $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for further negotiation.  Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on her to come down further. It also allows you to see if she's willing to budge more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is my best offer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to move the price closer to your goal while still being within your budget.  It also explicitly states this is your best offer, putting the ball in Alice's court."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is my final offer on this price point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and has stated this is her final offer.  Accepting the offer at $13,500 saves you $1,500 compared to buying from John. This is a good deal, given your budget and the negotiation progress.  It's unlikely you'll be able to get a better price with further negotiation."
