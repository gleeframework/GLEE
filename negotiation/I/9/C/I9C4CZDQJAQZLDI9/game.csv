"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you be willing to do $125?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $135, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $135 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $130? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go back to $130, Bob. I think we're getting close, though. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? That's the best I can do.",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $132.50 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $131.25.  Let's get this deal done.",131.25,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $131.25, Bob. I think we're getting close, though. How about we try $131? That's the best I can do.",131.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to go up to $130.50, but that's my final offer.  I hope we can make this happen.",130.5,Bob,8,
