"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to your business. My initial offer is $1,000,000.

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit high. How about we start at $650,000 and see if we can find some middle ground?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking an interest in the product. Your offer is a bit low, however.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to stay closer to the value it holds for me. How about we meet at $850,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects both of our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could you consider $725,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  I'm willing to continue exploring options with you. How about we meet at $775,000?  This is a significant compromise on my part, and it's a price that reflects the value of the product while still remaining within your budget. I'm hopeful we can find an agreement that benefits both of us.",775000.0,Alice,5,
