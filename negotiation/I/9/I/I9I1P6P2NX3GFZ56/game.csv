"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a very competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $1,050,000. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, it's still a touch above what I'm comfortable with. How about $1,125,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and puts us closer to the middle ground.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to push the price down further. I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $1,250,000. This is my final offer before we reach the lower limit of what I'm comfortable with. I believe this price is fair, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm happy to finalize the deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
