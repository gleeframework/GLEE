"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at $900000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good deal, it's still quite a bit higher than my ideal price. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price.  There are 9 rounds left, so I have time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product, and it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Opening:** By dropping the price significantly to $700,000, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and showing that I'm not afraid to make a bold move. 
* **Reasonable Justification:** The message provides a reason for my offer, focusing on the value I perceive in the product.
* **Remaining Space:** I have left room for further negotiation, recognizing that I may need to compromise to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it can bring to your life. I'm confident that you'll find it's worth the investment.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer, but $800,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get her closer to my desired price point.  I still have 7 rounds left, and I believe there's potential for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $800,000 is closer, I'm still not there yet.  Let's try $750,000. This is a reasonable offer that reflects the value I see in the product, and it's a significant step closer to my initial offer. I'm confident that we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $825000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but I still have a few rounds left. It's worth trying to see if I can get a slightly lower price.  If I accept now, I'm still significantly above my ideal price point. I believe there's still room for negotiation."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution. $825,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to meet you at $775,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to listen. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you $795000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Alice's offer of $795,000 is only $25,000 away from my previous counteroffer.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 3 rounds left, the risk of continuing the negotiation is high. If I reject this offer, I might end up with a worse deal, or even have to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Acceptable Price:**  While I'd prefer a lower price, $795,000 is still within my budget and a significant savings compared to buying from John. 
* **Time to Close:** Accepting now allows me to secure the product and move on to other opportunities."
