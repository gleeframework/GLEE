Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're considering other options, but I'm still willing to work with you. I can sell it to you for $105, but I'll throw in a special bonus that's worth $5. So, the total price would be $105, and you'll get an extra $5 worth of value.

We are getting close to John's price, and it seems unlikely Alice will go much lower.  Continuing to negotiate is risky."

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that this is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $98. I've already given you a great deal, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $98. I can sell it to you for $101.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $101.5.

Alice is very unlikely to go below $100, and we've reached the point of diminishing returns in the negotiation. John's offer is only slightly more expensive at this point. It makes sense to cut our losses and secure the product from John."
