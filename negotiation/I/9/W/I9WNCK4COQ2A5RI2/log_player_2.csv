# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
