"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $150. Let me know if you're open to that.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $175 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering it to you for $165. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",165.0,Alice,5,
