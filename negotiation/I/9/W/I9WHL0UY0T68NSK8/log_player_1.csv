Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. It's a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your minimum:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so you should aim higher with Bob.
* **Starting high:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Leaving Bob room to negotiate:** The $19,000 offer allows Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. Even if he rejects the initial price, it opens the door for further discussion. 
* **Psychological pricing:**  Prices ending in ""9"" or ""99"" tend to be more appealing to buyers.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have some time and are comfortable with a potential negotiation. If you need to sell quickly, offering a price closer to $15,000 might be more practical."
