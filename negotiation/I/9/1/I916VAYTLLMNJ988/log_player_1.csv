Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John. 

By offering the product at $119, we are:

1. **Above Bob's Valuation:**  This might seem counterintuitive, but it leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving you the chance to lower the price slightly while still staying above your minimum.
2. **Below John's Offer:**  This ensures that if Bob rejects the offer, you're not losing money by holding out for a higher price."
