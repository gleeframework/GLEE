Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a significantly higher offer ($15,000) allows room for negotiation and the potential to secure a price well above your minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer Security:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 provides a safety net.  You can be more comfortable with a potentially risky initial offer.
* **Perception of Value:** A higher initial price might make Bob perceive the product as even more valuable or exclusive.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Be prepared to adjust your approach based on Bob's response and potential counter-offers."
