"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm asking $12,500 for it.  This gives you a significant savings while allowing me to get a fair price. What do you say?",12500.0,Alice,1,
