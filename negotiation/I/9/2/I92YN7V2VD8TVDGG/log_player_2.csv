"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a very competitive price.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm asking $12,500 for it.  This gives you a significant savings while allowing me to get a fair price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $12,500 is a good deal. It saves you $2,500 compared to buying from John and is significantly less than your maximum budget."
