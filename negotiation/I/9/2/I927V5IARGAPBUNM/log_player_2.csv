"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your budget and even above the product's worth to her. It's highly unlikely she'll come down to your desired price range without significant negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit below what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $1,000,000.  Rejecting her offer again allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal.  You still have the option of buying from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations don't go your way."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. Given that we're both trying to reach an agreement, I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
