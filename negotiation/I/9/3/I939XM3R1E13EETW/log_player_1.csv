Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, as it's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to meet my value.  It's unlikely he'll accept immediately, but it sets the stage for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept anything less than $1,100,000.  I'll counter his offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm  countering with $1,100,000. This is a significant step down from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer, indicating a willingness to compromise while still protecting my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While $1,050,000 is still below my minimum value, it's a significant improvement and a compromise I'm willing to make to secure a sale. Selling to John would guarantee me my desired price, but there's a good chance I can get closer with Bob."
