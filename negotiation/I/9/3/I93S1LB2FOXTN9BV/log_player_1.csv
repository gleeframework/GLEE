"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  I believe it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $900,000.  This leaves room for us both to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to get a better deal. I understand the value of this product, but $900000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to offer $750000, reflecting a price that's fair for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is better than John's offer of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,000,000).  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to the value of the product.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This price is fair for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This price is fair for both of us and reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is the same as John's offer.  There's no benefit to continuing to negotiate with Bob as the price is unlikely to go higher.  Selling to John now ensures a guaranteed sale at the same price."
