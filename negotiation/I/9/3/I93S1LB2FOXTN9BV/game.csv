"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  I believe it's worth $1000000 to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $900000.  This leaves room for us both to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm looking to get a better deal. I understand the value of this product, but $900000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to offer $750000, reflecting a price that's fair for both of us. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to the value of the product.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $825000. This price is fair for both of us and keeps the deal moving forward.  Let me know your thoughts.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This price is fair for both of us and reflects the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",800000.0,Bob,4,
