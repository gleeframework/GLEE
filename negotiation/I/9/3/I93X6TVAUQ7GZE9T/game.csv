"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I believe would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course!",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit higher than $11,500. How about we try $9,500? I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a compromise.  While I'm keen to see this product in your hands, $9,500 is still too low. Perhaps we can settle on $10,500? This feels like a fair offer considering its potential value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about $10,500, Alice. I'd like to try to get closer to the product's true value to me. How about we meet at $9,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want you to feel good about this purchase. However, I need to be fair to myself as well.  Let's make this our final price: $9,750. It's a strong offer, and I think it reflects the value this product will bring you.",9750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $9,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $9,250? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9250.0,Bob,8,
