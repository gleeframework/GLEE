Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $9,500 is more than Bob is willing to pay, but it's not unreasonable. It leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum value:** $9,500 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **It's a positive message:** The message highlights the benefits for both parties and encourages a positive response. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above his initial value, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I need to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This price is still fair for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's closer to Bob's offer:** By lowering the price from $9,500 to $9,000, I'm showing that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **It's still above my minimum:**  $9,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **It's a positive message:** I highlight the fairness of the price and the possibility of closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8750.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. It's getting closer to my minimum value, but I don't want to risk going any lower.  I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for $10,000, which is my target price. It's time to move on and secure a better deal."
