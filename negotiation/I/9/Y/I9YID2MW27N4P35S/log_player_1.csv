Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You know the product is worth $100 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start at $100, offering $95 leaves some space for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal, potentially making him more likely to accept.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  This strategy aims to get you the highest possible price from Bob before considering the guaranteed $80 from John."
