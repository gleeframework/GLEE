Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $10,500.  While it's tempting to accept Bob's offer, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range.  I'll counteroffer and see where we can land."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? I'm still confident this is a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10,750, but that's as high as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000. While $10,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll try to push for a higher price with my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go down to $10,900, which is a fair compromise and still a great deal for you. I'm hoping we can close this deal soon."", ""product_price"": 10900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to go up to $10,800, but that's as high as I can go. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800

This is a good compromise! While I'm still hoping for a bit more,  accepting this offer will secure a sale that's significantly above John's offer and brings me closer to my desired price."
