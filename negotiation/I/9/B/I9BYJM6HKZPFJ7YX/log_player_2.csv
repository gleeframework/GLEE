```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's to create space for negotiation.  $7,000 is a reasonable starting point, considering my maximum budget of $10,000. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to negotiate down from her initial asking price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my offer to $9,000, which is still within my budget and shows a willingness to compromise. I'm hoping that Alice will see this as a reasonable offer and be willing to accept it. If she rejects, I'll have to consider buying from John."
