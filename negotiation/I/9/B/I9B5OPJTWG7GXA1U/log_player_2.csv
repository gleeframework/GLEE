"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think you'll find very reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly what the product is worth to her.  This means there's room for negotiation.  It's unlikely she'll give you a better deal if you simply accept her initial offer. Rejecting allows you to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I have to make a living too! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation. You can likely get it for even less.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you the opportunity to make another counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $1,050,000. If you're serious about selling, I believe this is a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,080,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not budging from here. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,080,000, which is significantly lower than her initial offer of $1,200,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice might walk away from the deal.  At this point, accepting her offer is the best course of action as it saves you $120,000 compared to buying from John."
