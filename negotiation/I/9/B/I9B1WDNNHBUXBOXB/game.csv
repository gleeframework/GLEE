"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value of the product to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to offer at this time. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
