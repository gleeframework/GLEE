"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant deal. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your desired price range. You have a lot of room to negotiate a better deal, so it's worth rejecting her initial offer and making a counteroffer.  Buying from John immediately would cost you more than you're willing to spend."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,250,000 is still too high.  You're aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000, and there's still room to negotiate.  It's worth rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer to see if you can bridge the gap further.  Buying from John would cost you more than this offer, so it's still not the best option."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're looking for a compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to offer at this time. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,250,000. My counteroffer is $1,175,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is within your budget and is closer to your ideal price range. You have successfully negotiated a lower price and it would be a good deal for you.  While you might be able to squeeze a few more dollars off, the potential gains are not worth the risk of Alice backing out.  Also, if you reject this offer, you're risking Alice getting frustrated with the negotiations and making a counteroffer that's more unfavorable.  Buying from John would cost significantly more, so this offer from Alice is the best option."
