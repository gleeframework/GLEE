"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for it, considering the potential benefits it offers. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what Bob would like to pay.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford at this time.  This price is fair, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your constraints, but I'm still looking to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer the product to you for $1025000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value the product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Since Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to go with the sure deal and avoid further negotiation.  This saves Bob the time and risk of further negotiations, especially as he has already made multiple counteroffers without success."
