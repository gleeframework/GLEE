Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Ensure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling at $9,500 still earns Alice significantly more than the $8,000 John is offering.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiation style or how likely he is to accept the initial offer."
