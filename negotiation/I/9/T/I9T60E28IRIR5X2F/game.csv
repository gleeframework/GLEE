"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $150, which is a fair price considering its quality and value.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $60 is quite low for the value this product offers.  Could you meet me halfway at $105?",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $105 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit much for me. Would you consider $75? I think that's a fair offer.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference again and settle at $90? That's a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're right, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further. How about $80? That's the absolute highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,6,
