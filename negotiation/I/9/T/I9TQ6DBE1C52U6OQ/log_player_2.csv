# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $10,000. It's worth rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $9,250.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think.

While Alice's offer is better than her first one, it's still a bit too high for you. There's room for negotiation, so it's worth rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer."
