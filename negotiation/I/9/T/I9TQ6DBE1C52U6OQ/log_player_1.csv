This offer starts at a price that is a good compromise, allowing for potential negotiation while still ensuring a reasonable profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a little less. I'm willing to offer $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below Alice's desired minimum. Alice wants to maximize her profit and should try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to sell for $9,250.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

```

Alice should accept Bob's offer. While it's still slightly below her desired minimum, it's a good compromise and significantly better than selling to John. Continuing to negotiate could lead to Bob walking away, leaving Alice with no other option than to sell to John."
