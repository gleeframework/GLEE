"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that's slightly above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, suggesting he'll get a good deal even at this price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking for his opinion, implying I'm open to discussing the price further.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic starting point, and I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's responses in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob is interested, he's starting the negotiation far too low.  I need to push for a higher price.
* **Time for a counteroffer:**  There are still 9 rounds remaining, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low.  Consider the significant value this product brings to you - we're talking about $1,200,000 in value to you. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This gives you a great deal, and it ensures I get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting low offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's far below my acceptable range.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to justify a higher price.
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Focus on benefits:**  I'm framing the offer in a way that emphasizes the benefits to Bob, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand where you're coming from.  I'm serious about buying this product, but we need to find a price that works for both of us. How about $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob has moved slightly closer, $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation opportunities:** We're still in the early rounds. I can afford to keep negotiating and see if Bob is willing to come up further.
* **Risk of selling to John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe option, but I believe there's still potential to earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob.

I will counteroffer with a slightly lower price in the next round, but I'll keep the offer above my minimum acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $975,000 is still a bit low, but I see that we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and I accept $1,012,500?  This would be a win-win for both of us. You'd still be getting a great deal on a product worth significantly more to you, and I'd be able to secure a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,050,000) and Bob's current offer ($975,000). This demonstrates a genuine commitment to finding common ground.
* **Emphasizing win-win:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win scenario for both of us, emphasizing the value Bob will receive and the fair price I will get.
* **Maintaining minimum:**  My counteroffer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.

I'm hoping that by demonstrating a willingness to compromise and highlighting the mutual benefits, I can convince Bob to accept my offer in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle at $990,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my acceptable range, it's still below my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Limited time:** With only 4 rounds remaining, there's less room for negotiation.
* **Potential to improve:** There's still potential to push for a higher price. Bob is showing a willingness to compromise, and we're approaching a point where a small increase could secure the deal.

I will counteroffer with a price that is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you, and I really want to make this deal work.  $990,000 is almost there, but it's just a little below what I need to accept. Let's split the difference one more time and call it $1,000,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal without further negotiation. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's the exact midpoint between my previous offer ($1,012,500) and Bob's latest offer ($990,000). This demonstrates a strong commitment to compromise.
* **Time is ticking:** With only 3 rounds left, I need to secure a deal to avoid selling to John. This offer represents the best compromise I can make.
* **Finality:** I'm emphasizing the desire to finalize the deal and avoid further negotiations. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob.

This offer is my final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. If he rejects it, I will likely sell the product to John to guarantee a sale."
