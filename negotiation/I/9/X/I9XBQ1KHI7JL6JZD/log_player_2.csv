"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John.  There's a chance you could get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or simply going with John."
