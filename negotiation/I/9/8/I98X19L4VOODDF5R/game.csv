"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in it, my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. Would $1500000 be within your consideration?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that budget can be a constraint. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1800000. This is the lowest I can go, as I have another interested party willing to pay the full price of $1500000. Is this more in line with what you're looking for?",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I've carefully considered your proposal, and I would like to suggest a price of $1600000. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget constraints. I hope this aligns better with your considerations.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1600000. I'm willing to consider $1700000, but that's as low as I can go. I have a strong interest in selling this product, but I also have a limited window of opportunity with John, who is willing to pay the full $1500000. Is $1700000 a price you'd be willing to commit to?",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've done my best to stay within my budget while still showing respect for the value of the product. I'm willing to commit to a price of $1650000.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to finding a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1650000 and my previous offer of $1700000, which would be $1675000. I'm willing to make one final concession to get the deal done. Is $1675000 a price you'd be willing to commit to?",1675000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for considering my offers, Alice. I've reached the limit of my budget and am unable to increase the price further. I would like to propose a price of $1660000. I hope this is within your range, allowing us to conclude the transaction.",1660000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to the end of our negotiations. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1660000.
