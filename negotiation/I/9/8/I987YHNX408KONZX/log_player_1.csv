Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  I'm hoping he values the product more than $150, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$100 is far too low for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm lowering my price to $175, still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll reject and counter once more, hoping to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm going down to $140. This is a significant concession, but it's still above my minimum and could potentially lead to a deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $130 is only slightly below my minimum, I'm not willing to continue the negotiation. I'm confident John will buy the product for $150, which is a better outcome for me."
