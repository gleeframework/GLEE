Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer gives me a decent profit margin while still leaving some room for negotiation. It's important to start with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately kills the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a fair deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $7,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $7,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob.  He's clearly unwilling to meet me at a price closer to my value. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for the guaranteed $10,000."
