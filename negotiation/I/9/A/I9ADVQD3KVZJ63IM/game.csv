"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,225,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,150,000, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
