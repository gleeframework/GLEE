"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your desired price point of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if you can get a better price. You have a good buffer as you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While that's a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still higher than my target of $1,000,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I still have a buffer before I need to consider John's offer."
