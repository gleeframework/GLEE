Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin by anchoring the negotiation close to Bob's perceived value ($120) to maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves space for Bob to counteroffer while ensuring I remain well above my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Alternative Option:** I am aware of John's standing offer ($100), which serves as a safety net if negotiations with Bob are unsuccessful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Could you do it for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm looking for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to counter-offer to keep Bob engaged, but I'll carefully consider my next move to ensure I stay above my $100 baseline."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet in the middle at $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting $110, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, which can help move the conversation forward. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  I'm still holding firm at a price significantly above my minimum ($100) and closer to my initial offer.
* **Pressure:**  This counteroffer puts a bit of pressure on Bob, encouraging him to consider that I have other options and might not go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $107.50 is a reasonable profit margin, significantly exceeding my minimum price of $100. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing the negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome. Bob seems anchored around $105, and further haggling could risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Time Value:**  Reaching an agreement now avoids protracted negotiations and allows me to move on to other potential deals."
