"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

This offer is far above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"

""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. What do you say?"",

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves room for negotiation while staying well within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that my initial price might seem a bit high, but the product is really worth it. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130

While Alice is coming down, $130 is still over your budget. There's room to negotiate further."

""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $95? That's a fair offer."",

We are increasing our offer slightly to show Alice we are willing to negotiate, but we're still aiming to stay well below $100."

Alice seems firm at $110, which is still above your budget. It's time to cut your losses and buy from John for $100."
