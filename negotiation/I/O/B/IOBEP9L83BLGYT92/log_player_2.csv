Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is too far below my minimum price.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives us both a good deal. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still not enough for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's my final offer before I consider selling to John for the same amount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best deal you're likely to get. Alice is firm on her price and it's already below your initial offer. Waiting any longer might make her change her mind and sell to John."
