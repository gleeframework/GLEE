{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is too far below my minimum price.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still gives us both a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $950,000 is still too low. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a price that is more favorable."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still not enough for me. Let's compromise. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,000,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. It's my final offer before I consider selling to John for the same amount."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
