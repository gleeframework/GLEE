"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. The product is valuable, but I'm looking to make a smart investment, and I think this price is more reasonable.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,050,000. This price still allows you to make a profit while being fair to me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it allows you to make a significant return on your investment. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $975,000. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,6,
