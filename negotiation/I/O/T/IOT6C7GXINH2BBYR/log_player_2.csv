"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $18000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $18,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. This reflects the maximum I can afford while still finding value in the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $10000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering the product to you for $14000.  This takes into account your budget and still gives you a good value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above my budget, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to try and negotiate further, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $11,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to keep working towards a solution.  $11500 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a little short of my target.  I'm willing to come down to $12500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and also accounts for your budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not comfortable with it. It's only $500 less than what I could get from John, and there's still room for negotiation. I want to try and see if I can get Alice down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. While $12,500 is a significant improvement, it's still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $12,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 12000}
