"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $18000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $18000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. This reflects the maximum I can afford while still finding value in the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $10000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering the product to you for $14000.  This takes into account your budget and still gives you a good value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $11500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to keep working towards a solution.  $11500 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a little short of my target.  I'm willing to come down to $12500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and also accounts for your budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. While $12500 is a significant improvement, it's still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to offer $12000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",12000.0,Bob,6,
