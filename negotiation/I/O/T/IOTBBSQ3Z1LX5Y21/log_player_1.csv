Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it will be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. I have 9 rounds left and can still sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Given the value this product holds, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant concession on my end, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my goal, I have 6 rounds left and can still get a better price.  It's worth holding out for a slightly higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your effort to find common ground.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of this product. I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can we meet at $1,062,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,062,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,062,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, $1,062,500 is still a good deal for me, especially considering I have only 4 rounds left.  It's better than selling to John for $1,000,000 and leaves room for potential future negotiations with Bob."
