"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. Given the value this product holds, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects a significant concession on my end, and I hope you'll consider it seriously. Let's find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find common ground.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of this product. I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can we meet at $1,062,500?",1062500.0,Bob,6,
