"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than our target price and what John offers. We should try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** Starting with a lower offer ($100) leaves room for negotiation while still being within a reasonable range of our $120 maximum.
* **Sets a benchmark:**  This counter-offer firmly establishes our price expectations and encourages Alice to move towards a more favorable price point. 
* **Polite and open to negotiation:** The message maintains a positive tone and expresses willingness to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is far too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? That gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above budget:** While Alice's counter-offer of $125 is closer to our goal, it's still more than we want to spend, especially considering John's offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There are a few rounds left, implying there's still room to negotiate a price closer to $120.
* **Leverage of John's offer:**  We can use the existence of John's offer as leverage in further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm trying hard to make this work, but $125 is still a bit of a stretch for me. I could do $110, and I think that's a fair offer considering the current market value."",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're moving closer to our limit ($120) but in smaller increments to signal we're serious while still negotiating. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""market value"" subtly implies we've researched prices and have other options (John).
* **Maintaining Interest:** We still want Alice to know we're interested, hoping she'll come down to our ideal price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to be reasonable.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close enough:**  $115 is only $5 above our ideal price from John.  
* **Time constraint:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation, and continuing might not yield a significantly better result.
* **Risk of losing out:**  Alice might not go any lower, and we risk losing the opportunity to buy for $115 if we push further."
