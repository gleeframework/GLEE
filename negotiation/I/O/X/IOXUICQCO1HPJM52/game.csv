"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep the cost below $10,000. Could we possibly negotiate down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below the product's value to you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",10500.0,Alice,3,
