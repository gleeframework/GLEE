Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below the product's value to you. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.
