Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below John's offer.  Bob is clearly interested and incrementally increasing his offers. We have room to negotiate and try to draw him closer to our desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?

**Reasoning:** Bob has met John's offer. There's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a higher price from Bob, and we risk him walking away. Accepting ensures we get a fair price for the product."
