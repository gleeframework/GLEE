"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,490,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,490,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,490,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,490,000 is higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. By rejecting her offer, you open the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that's closer to your acceptable range, or you can proceed to buy from John at a lower price."
