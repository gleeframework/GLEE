You should reject Alice's offer.  It's above your maximum budget, and you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $7,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and is still within my budget. I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm better off buying from John for $8,000.  This ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
