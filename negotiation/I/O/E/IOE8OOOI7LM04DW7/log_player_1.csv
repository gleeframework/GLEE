``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum price. This gives room for negotiation while still aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above that price point.  How about $10,500? It's a compromise that reflects the product's value and stays within your budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9500? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget of $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I'm willing to negotiate one more time to see if we can get closer to my desired price."
