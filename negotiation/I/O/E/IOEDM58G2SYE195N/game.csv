"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,750 yet. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's try $10,200. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value the product brings to you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I believe I'm being reasonable.  How about $9,850?  That's a significant move from my last offer, and it shows I'm serious about making a deal.",9850.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my target price. However, I'm still a bit short of where I'd like to be. I'm willing to meet you at $10,100, which is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can make a deal at this price.",10100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to pay $9,800. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal today. If this doesn't work, I'll have to go with another option I have.",9800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,800. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not comfortable with this price. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle. Let's try $10,050. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finally come to an agreement.",10050.0,Alice,9,
