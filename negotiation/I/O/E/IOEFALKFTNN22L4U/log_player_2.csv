**Reasoning:**

Alice has revealed her lowest acceptable price is $1,500,000. This exceeds your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay.  Therefore, it's the most logical decision to cut your losses and purchase from John for $1,000,000."
