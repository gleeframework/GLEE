Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""limited time"" and ""great deal for the value,"" Alice attempts to create a sense of urgency and value perception. 
* **Safety Net:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always fall back on selling to John for $150, ensuring she doesn't lose out."
