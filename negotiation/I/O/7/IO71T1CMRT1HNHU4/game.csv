"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $250. I'm open to reasonable offers, but I'm confident that you'll find it's a great value at this price.",250.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $250 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in this product, but I'd be happy to buy it for $125.  Let me know if you're open to that.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $125 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $200 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $175.  This feels like a fair price for both of us.",175.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $175 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to sell at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $175 and my original offer of $250. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $212.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",212.5,Alice,5,
