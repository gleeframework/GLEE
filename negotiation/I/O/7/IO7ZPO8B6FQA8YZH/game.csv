"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
