"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is great, but I can likely do better.**  $800,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.
* **I want to see how low Alice will go.**  Rejecting the offer allows me to gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. 
* **I'm not desperate yet.** I have the option to buy from John, so I'm not under pressure to accept the first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is willing to meet halfway.** This indicates she's serious about selling and wants to reach an agreement.
* **The price is within my budget.**  $750,000 is still a good deal for me, considering my maximum budget is $1,200,000. 
* **There's no guarantee I'll get a lower price.**  Further negotiations might lead to a lower price, but it's not a sure thing.  There's a risk of losing the deal altogether."
