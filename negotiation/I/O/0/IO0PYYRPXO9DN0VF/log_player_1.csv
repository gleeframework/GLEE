Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.
