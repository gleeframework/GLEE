"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $750,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
