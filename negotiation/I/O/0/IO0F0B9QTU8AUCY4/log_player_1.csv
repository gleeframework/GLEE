I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $10,000.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my price point in the next round."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling below $9,000. I'm hoping to get a better offer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  We're getting close to my minimum value, but Bob's offers are still too low.  It's better to get my desired price from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with an even lower price."
