"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8500. This is still a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not sure if $8500 is within my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?,8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $8000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $10000. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $8000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $8000?",8000.0,Bob,6,
