{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still more than I want to spend. I'll try countering again to see if I can get closer to $100."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer it to you for $110. It's still a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $110. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $100."
