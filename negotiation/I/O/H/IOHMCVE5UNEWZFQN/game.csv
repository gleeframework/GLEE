"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $14,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. Would you consider $11,500? I believe that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",13000.0,Alice,5,
