"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. I'm aiming for a deal that works well for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's inherent value.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to stretch to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering John is also offering me the product at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
