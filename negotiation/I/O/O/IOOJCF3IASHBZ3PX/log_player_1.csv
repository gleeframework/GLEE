"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high initially to establish a strong bargaining position. Even though Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting much higher gives me room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a price significantly above both his valuation and John's offer.
* **Gauging Interest:** This first offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and what negotiation tactics might be effective. His response will dictate my next move. 
* **Safety Net:** I have the option to walk away and sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). Accepting this would be a substantial loss. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While his offer is low, the fact that he's willing to pay $800,000 indicates there's room to negotiate upwards. I'll counter with a price closer to his valuation, but still above it.
* **John as Leverage:**  I'll keep the option of selling to John open for now, as it provides me with a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've significantly reduced my asking price from $2,000,000 to $1,300,000, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Above Valuation:**  The new price is still comfortably above Bob's stated value of $1,000,000, giving me room to negotiate further while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's ""true value,"" I'm subtly anchoring the negotiation around a higher number than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,300,000 is still too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress but not enough:** Bob is moving closer to his true valuation, which is a positive sign. However, $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiating window:** We are only on round 4 out of 10.  There's still time to negotiate for a better deal.
* **Maintain firmness:** Accepting now might signal that I'm willing to settle for less than my target. Rejecting reinforces the value of the product and encourages Bob to offer more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on the price. I'm aiming for a deal that works well for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This reflects a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the product's inherent value."",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've made another significant concession, dropping $175,000 from my previous offer. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but am seeking a fair middle ground.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The offer of $1,125,000 is precisely halfway between our last two offers, framing it as a reasonable and balanced proposal.
* **Time Constraint:**  While I have time, I don't want to drag the negotiation unnecessarily. This offer encourages Bob to respond decisively and potentially close the deal sooner."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to stretch to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering John is also offering me the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bluff Called:** Bob's claim that John is offering the product for $1,000,000 is likely a bluff. It's improbable that John, knowing my minimum acceptable price, would undercut me.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is his ""final offer,"" Bob is trying to pressure me into accepting. However, I have a strong alternative.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price of $1,500,000. Accepting Bob's offer would mean losing out on a significant amount of profit. 

**It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and secure the guaranteed deal with John.**"
