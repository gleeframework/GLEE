Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but still lower than your minimum acceptable price. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring you still get a good price. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential gain:** By starting high, you leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a higher price than you would by starting closer to Bob's valuation.
* **Avoid immediate rejection:** A very high initial offer might make Bob immediately walk away. 
* **Keep the option open:** This offer leaves room for further negotiation and allows you to assess Bob's interest before resorting to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit. I want to see if I can push for a higher price by sending Bob a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. It reflects my desire to secure a better price while acknowledging Bob's potential interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $1,025,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I would get from John. At this point, I'm confident that I can't get a significantly higher price from Bob, and I'd rather secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
