"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you, considering its value to you. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not interested. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm very interested in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $950,000. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great value for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer is still above my budget, even though it's a compromise.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This saves me $50,000 compared to Alice's current offer and ensures I get the product within my budget."
