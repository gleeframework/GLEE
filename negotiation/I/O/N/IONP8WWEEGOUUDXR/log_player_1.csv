"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm very interested in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $950,000.
