"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $14,500?",14500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $14,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,750?  That's still a great deal for a product worth so much to you.",15750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $15,750 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,250.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",15250.0,Bob,4,
