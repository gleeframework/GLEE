"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay. There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially save more by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a lower price point.  Since I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 from John, this is a good starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay from John. There's still room for negotiation. I'll continue to counteroffer and aim for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still holding firm on a price lower than Alice's current offer. This is a good middle ground that might be more appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is still higher than John's price, but it's getting closer to my target. With only 5 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. There's a good chance that Alice might not lower her price further, or we might not reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer is the most reasonable choice, as it's within my budget and secures the product."
