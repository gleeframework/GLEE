{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a price above my minimum of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers. This way I can explore getting a better price without risking losing him as a buyer entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, as I think it's a bit pricey at $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $90. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would like to get closer to my ideal price, Bob's offer is still above my minimum of $80. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit.  I can always try to negotiate a better price with John in the future if I have more inventory."
