"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a significant compromise for me. This offer is fair considering the product's value to me and leaves some room for your profit. I hope we can finalize this deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $16,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500, which is a fair price that balances our interests. Let's see if we can find common ground.",13500.0,Alice,5,
