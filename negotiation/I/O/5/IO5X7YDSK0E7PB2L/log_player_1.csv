Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. This allows for a potential deal while still ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial estimate, it is still far below my minimum value for the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for such a low price right now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. Could we possibly agree on $9500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable selling for $9,500. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not able to go lower than $10,000. This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and I believe it reflects the value of this product. Are you willing to meet me halfway?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
