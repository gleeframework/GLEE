"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be valuable to you. I'm thinking of a price around $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind. Could you meet me halfway at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand we're a ways apart on price. While $10,500 is still a bit much for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for coming up a bit. I'm getting closer.  How about $9,000, and we can close the deal?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,000? I think that's a fair offer.",8000.0,Bob,6,
