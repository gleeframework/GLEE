Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,300,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm also significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, so there's room for me to concede during negotiations.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is positive and encourages a response from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching Bob's response closely. If he rejects the offer, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counter-counteroffer. I'll also keep John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price.  Accepting it would mean a loss of $400,000 compared to selling to John.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob.  He's shown a willingness to pay more than his initial value of $1,000,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation. I can make a counter-offer that hopefully gets us closer to a mutually agreeable price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counter-offer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired amount. I'll also continue to keep John's offer in mind as a backup in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is exactly in the middle of my previous offer of $1,300,000 and Bob's offer of $1,100,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Still Above Minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it's a significant step closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Positive and Encouraging:** I've maintained a positive tone, emphasizing the benefits of a deal for both parties.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be watching Bob's response carefully. If he accepts, I'll be happy to finalize the deal. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
