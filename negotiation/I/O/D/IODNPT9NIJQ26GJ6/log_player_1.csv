Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $100. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially get closer to maximizing your profit. 
* **Justification:** While simply stating a price is an option, providing a brief reason (even if generic) can make Bob more receptive.
* **Limited Time:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiation style and how much you want to ensure a sale, you could adjust the price lower."
