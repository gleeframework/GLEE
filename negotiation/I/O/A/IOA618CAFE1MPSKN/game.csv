"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $7,500. I believe this offers a fair compromise between the value you see in the product and my need to recoup some of the investment. Please let me know if this works for you.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I appreciate you working with me.  While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. Considering the discussions we've had, I am willing to accept $7,200 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise, allowing us to move forward with the transaction while also ensuring a reasonable return on my investment.",7200.0,Alice,5,
