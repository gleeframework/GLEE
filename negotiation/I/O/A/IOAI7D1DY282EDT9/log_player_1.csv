Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a real game-changer, and I believe it can be a huge asset to your business. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000. This price reflects the value I know you see in it, and allows for a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  $1,100,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum ($1,200,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Highlighting the value to Bob (""game-changer"", ""huge asset"") can make him more motivated to accept.
* **""Good deal for both"" framing:** This implies a win-win scenario, making the offer more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've secured a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer, considering John's offer as my floor price. I'll be prepared to make counteroffers until we reach an acceptable agreement or I choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in this product, but $1100000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $950000 for it, which is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is significantly below my minimum of $1,200,000 and even below my initial offer of $1,100,000.
* **John's offer is still on the table:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** Although Bob's offer is low, he acknowledged the value of the product. This suggests there might be room for negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum or to a price that makes me feel comfortable enough to continue negotiating. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, knowing I can always choose to sell to him if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $950,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for your business, and I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000. This price reflects the value you see in the product, and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** My counteroffer is closer to Bob's $950,000, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing mutual benefit:** I frame the counteroffer as a ""mutually beneficial agreement,""  appealing to Bob's desire for a good deal.
* **Maintaining a price above my minimum:** $1,050,000 is still above my minimum of $1,200,000,  but provides a good starting point for further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** I will evaluate Bob's response to this counteroffer, considering his previous offer and his potential willingness to negotiate further. 
* **Flexibility and potential compromise:** I'm prepared to potentially adjust my counteroffer again if necessary,  but will prioritize staying above my minimum while keeping John's offer in mind."
