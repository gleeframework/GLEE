Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.

Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
