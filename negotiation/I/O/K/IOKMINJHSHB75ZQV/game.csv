"I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to get at least $10,500 for it. This is still a great price considering its worth to you.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $10,200, but I think I can do even better. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but I'm hoping we can find a price that's a bit lower. Can you think about going any lower?",10200.0,Bob,4,
