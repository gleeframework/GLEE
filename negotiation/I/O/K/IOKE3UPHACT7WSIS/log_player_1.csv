Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong offer from another party."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could offer the product at $1,200,000 (John's price), aiming slightly lower increases the chance of Bob accepting and still yields a significant profit.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** By mentioning another offer, we create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offered price leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, potentially allowing you to secure an even higher price. 

The offered price of $1,150,000 balances maximizing potential profit from Bob while still securing a guaranteed sale to John if Bob declines."
