"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's uniqueness, $20000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $10000 at this time. ",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $12000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll unfortunately have to look elsewhere.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is a tough limit for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you at $14000. It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $12000. It's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value and the time we've spent negotiating. Let me know if you're willing to accept it. I'm ready to close the deal.",12000.0,Bob,6,
