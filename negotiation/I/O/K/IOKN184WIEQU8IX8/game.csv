"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $9,200 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's make this deal happen.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,750 and $9,200, so I'll offer it to you for $9,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
