"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think that's a fair price for a product worth $15,000 to you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $16,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
