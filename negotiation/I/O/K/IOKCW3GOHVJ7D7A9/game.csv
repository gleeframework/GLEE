"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're willing to come up a little.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, Alice. While $10,250 is closer to fair, I'm aiming for a price closer to $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me there?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, which is good.  $9,500 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $10,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it's closer to what I need.",10000.0,Alice,5,
