"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting offer is way above your limit. You have plenty of room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I am interested in the product, $18,000 is too high for me.  Would you consider $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low offer gives you the most room to negotiate upwards. It's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, but it opens the floor for a counteroffer.  We're aiming to land somewhere between our ideal price and her starting price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but $8,000 is quite low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice meeting in the middle is a good sign, but $12,000 is still above your budget and John's price. There's room to negotiate further down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. How about we settle at $10,000? That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}

**Reasoning:**  We're now pushing our luck a little by offering John's price. However, by stating it's our final offer, we're increasing the pressure on Alice to accept.  There's a chance she'll take it to close the deal. If not, we can always go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $12,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is unwilling to budge below $12,500. It's clear she won't go down to your target of $10,000.  Since you can get the product for your ideal price from John, it's time to cut negotiations with Alice and buy from him."
