{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 11999}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to get as close to that as possible from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,999 leaves a tiny bit of wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly. 
* **High Anchor Price:** This price point establishes a high perceived value and makes it feel like Bob is getting a small ""discount."" 

It's unlikely Bob will accept this price knowing his own valuation is much lower. However, it positions you to potentially negotiate down slightly while still remaining well above your minimum acceptable price."
