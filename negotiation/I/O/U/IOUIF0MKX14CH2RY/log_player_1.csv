""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to your operations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Our goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without going over, leaving him with a perceived gain.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $925,000 is a strong starting point, it allows some room for negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer. 
* **Securing a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, this offer ensures a substantial profit over our guaranteed sale price to John ($800,000)."
