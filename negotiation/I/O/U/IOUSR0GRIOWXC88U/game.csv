"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
