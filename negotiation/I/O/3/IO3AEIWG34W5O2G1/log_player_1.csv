Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I still think $1,200,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,350,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price without significant concessions on my part. Selling to John ensures I get my desired value without further negotiation."
