Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to you (Alice), the message hints at it by mentioning ""its value.""  This subtly implies to Bob that the product is worth a significant amount.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you'll get at least $8,000. This allows you to be bolder in your initial offer to Bob."
