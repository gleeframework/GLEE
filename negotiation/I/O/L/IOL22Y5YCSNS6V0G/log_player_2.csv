"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000.  This is a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, so you don't get any savings by accepting it.  It's better to reject and see if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice or just buy from John for the same price."
