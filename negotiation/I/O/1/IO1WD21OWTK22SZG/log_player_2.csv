"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $10000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you consider $8,000?  "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a much lower price. He's trying to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and establish a starting point for bargaining.  The message also emphasizes his interest in the product, making the counteroffer seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $9000?  I'm confident this product is worth it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still asking for more than Bob's target price of $8,000.  Rejecting her offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to his desired price. He's not yet at a point where buying from John is a better option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a bit more, but $9,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go to $8,500.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to show good faith, but he's still firm in his desire to stay below $9,000. He's also added a sense of urgency by suggesting he'll have to explore other options if this offer isn't accepted. This aims to pressure Alice into considering his offer seriously."
