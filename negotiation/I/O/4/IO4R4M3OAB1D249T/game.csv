"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a lower price, closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I was willing to sell it for.
