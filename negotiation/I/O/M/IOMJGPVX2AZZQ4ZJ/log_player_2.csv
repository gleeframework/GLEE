"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $14,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this price reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price, especially since the product is only worth $12,000 to her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Aiming Below Alice's Value:**  My goal is to buy the product for less than it's worth to Alice ($12,000). 
* **Polite and Professional:**  Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $11,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $12,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $12,500 is a reasonable price and within my acceptable range (below $15,000).
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  While she might not stick to it absolutely, Alice saying this is her final offer adds pressure. It's unlikely she'll go much lower. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has the potential for a slightly better price, but also risks Alice backing out or me having to settle for John's higher price."
