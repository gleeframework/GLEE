Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $110. I believe you'll find great value in it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $110 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Ensure a Sale:**  The price is still significantly higher than John's offer ($80), ensuring a profit even if Bob negotiates a lower price."
