"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob should reject the offer. It is way too high, and there are still rounds left. There is potential to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While $16,000 is closer to his budget, he can likely still get a better price by continuing to negotiate. He can also potentially get a better price from John, so there's no reason to rush into a deal yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,500.  I think this is a fair price, considering it's closer to your desired price and still within my budget. Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 14500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $14,500 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,500. This would be a fair compromise, and it's a price I can live with. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can buy the product from John for $15,000, which is a better price than Alice's current offer.  While there's a chance Alice might come down further, it's not worth risking it when he has a guaranteed deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $15,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $15,250 for the product.  This is a fair price, as it's only slightly above John's offer and still below your desired price. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 15250}
