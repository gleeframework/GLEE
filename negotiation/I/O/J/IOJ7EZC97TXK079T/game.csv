"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $175 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $155. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my maximum budget is $135. If you're willing to go down to that, I'm happy to buy it from you.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $135 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $145. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",145.0,Alice,5,
