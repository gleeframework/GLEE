Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  $115 is higher than Bob's $100 valuation, so he has some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $115 is still higher than your minimum of $120, giving you room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  A $15 difference is a good margin for initial negotiations. 

By starting with a slightly higher price, you create room for bargaining while still securing a decent profit if Bob accepts the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, so I can afford to be a bit more assertive in negotiations with Bob. I'll try to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $105 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, though. How about $110? It's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:**  $110 is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $110 is still higher than my minimum, giving me a good profit if Bob accepts.
* **Setting a clear expectation:** This offer shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm in my desire to get closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $108 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I have the guaranteed sale to John for $120, so I can afford to be a little more stubborn. I'll try to get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $108 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession.  How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to finalize this deal.  "", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:** I'm signaling that this is my last offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Staying firm:** While I'm making a concession, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Framing it positively:** I'm emphasizing that this is a ""fair price for both of us"" to make the offer more appealing."
