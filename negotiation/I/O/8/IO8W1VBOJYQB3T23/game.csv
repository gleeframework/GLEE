"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product and am interested in purchasing it. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $10000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $10000 is a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $12000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
