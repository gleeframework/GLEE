Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  $950,000 is a good starting point as it's well above your minimum of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $950,000 is still lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($1,000,000), making it potentially attractive to him.

This initial offer allows for a potential negotiation where you can either:

* **Accept a counteroffer closer to your desired price.**  
* **Counter with a slightly lower price to meet halfway.**
* **End the negotiation and sell to John if Bob proves to be difficult.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still considerably lower than my ideal price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Make a counteroffer closer to my desired price:** This allows me to potentially secure a higher price than Bob's offer.
* **See if Bob is truly interested in a deal:** If he's not willing to move much higher, it may be better to sell to John for $800,000.
* **Gain more negotiation leverage:** By demonstrating I'm not desperate, I can potentially push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests. 

Here's why this is a good move:

* **It's closer to my ideal price:** It's still higher than Bob's offer, but closer to my desired price point.
* **It shows flexibility:**  It demonstrates I'm willing to meet halfway, which could make Bob more likely to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob isn't willing to go higher, I can consider lowering my offer slightly or selling to John."
