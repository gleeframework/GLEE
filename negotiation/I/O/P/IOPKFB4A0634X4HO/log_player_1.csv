Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  Any price above this is a loss for him.
* **The ""Zone of Agreement"":**  The ideal outcome is a price between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. This benefits both of you.

**Possible Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he got a somewhat good deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its long-term benefits. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creates a sense of value and urgency.
* **""Fair deal"" and ""long-term benefits"":**  Frames the price in a positive light.
* **Open-ended question:**  Encourages dialogue and negotiation.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship is important, a less aggressive approach might be better. 
* **Information is Power:**  You have the advantage of a backup offer. Don't reveal this to Bob.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob to find a mutually agreeable price within your acceptable range."
