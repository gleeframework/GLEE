"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value but well above my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is designed to be polite but firm, gauging Bob's initial reaction and willingness to engage in a potentially higher-priced deal. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind John's standing offer. If negotiations stall or Bob is unwilling to move significantly closer to my desired price, I can walk away and still secure a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is quite good, it's still significantly below his perceived value of the product. I believe there's room for negotiation.  We are only in round 2, and I want to see if I can secure a price closer to my initial offer before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and I'm confident it can deliver exceptional returns for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,115,000?"",
""product_price"": 1115000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** By moving closer to Bob's offer, I demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Maintain Value:**  The counteroffer still positions the product at a premium, reflecting its inherent worth.
* **Strategic Compromise:** Splitting the difference between his counteroffer and my previous price aims to find a middle ground while still securing a price significantly above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,090,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offers, but I believe he's still leaving money on the table. We're not even halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I'm comfortable applying a bit more pressure.  My goal is to push slightly above $1,100,000 before considering settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $1,105,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your interest."",
""product_price"": 1105000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm introducing a sense of urgency and signaling my strong position.
* **Slight Concession:** The price reduction, while small, shows I'm willing to move for a deal, but I'm holding firm above $1,100,000.
* **Time Pressure:** We are approaching the halfway point of the negotiation. Bob needs to understand I'm prepared to walk away and potentially make a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,105,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I think $1,080,000 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to make a serious offer at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob has essentially reverted back to a previous offer after my ""final offer"" tactic. This suggests he might not be willing to go much higher. 
* **Strong Offer:** $1,080,000 is still a significant profit above my minimum. Holding out for another $25,000 carries the risk of Bob walking away or significantly stalling the negotiation further.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now has value. Accepting Bob's offer avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and allows me to utilize the funds sooner."
