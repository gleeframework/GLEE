Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $110.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering the product for $110. This is a price that is:
    * More than my minimum acceptable price of $80.
    * Less than the product's value to Bob ($150).
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value the product holds for Bob. This increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims for a win-win scenario.  It allows me to get a good price for the product while still giving Bob a good deal. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $80, which is my minimum acceptable price."
