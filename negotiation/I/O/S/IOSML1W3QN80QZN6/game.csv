"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be hard-pressed to find a better offer elsewhere. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a counteroffer. However, I think the product's value is closer to $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's unique features and benefits. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $825,000 is still a touch higher than I'd like to go. How about $760,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",760000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $825,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you the product for $795,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thanks for continuing this negotiation.  I'm getting closer to a number I can agree to.  Would you consider $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, $775,000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $790,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",790000.0,Alice,7,
