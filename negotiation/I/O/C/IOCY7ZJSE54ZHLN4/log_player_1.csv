Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering $9,500, which is a good starting point considering Bob values the product at $10,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers from Bob without sacrificing too much of my profit.
* **Safeguard against John:** This offer is significantly higher than John's $8,000 offer, so I'm not rushing to sell to John at a lower price. 

**Strategy:** 

I'll assess Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer to see if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should simply sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is only $500 less than my initial offer.  
* **Potential for a higher price:** Since Bob is willing to pay $9,000, there's a good chance I can get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If I can't secure a better price with Bob, I have John's offer as a backup.

**Strategy:** 

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming to meet somewhere in the middle. This keeps the negotiation going while ensuring I'm not settling for a price I'm not happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  My counteroffer of $9,250 is a compromise, coming halfway between my previous offer of $9,500 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Keeping a reasonable profit margin:** This price still allows me to make a profit that's significantly better than John's $8,000 offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By not accepting Bob's offer immediately, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate and that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer is appealing enough to Bob to secure a deal without needing further negotiation.  If he rejects, I'll carefully assess his next counteroffer to determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation or if I should simply accept John's offer and end the process."
