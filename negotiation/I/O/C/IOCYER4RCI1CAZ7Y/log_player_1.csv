Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price closer to my minimum value ($1,000,000) to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm highlighting the value Bob will get from the product to incentivize him to accept.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The price is still lower than my minimum, allowing for potential counteroffers and negotiation.
* **Avoiding immediate John deal:** I want to explore the possibility of a higher price with Bob before resorting to the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $850,000 for your product. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for better deal:**  While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  There's a chance I can get closer to that with further negotiation.
* **Avoiding immediate loss:** Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but there's a possibility of getting more with Bob. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my ideal range. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I'm reducing my price from $900,000 to $950,000, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining a profit margin:**  $950,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I still make a profit.
* **Highlighting value and mutual benefit:** I'm reiterating the product's value and framing the deal as beneficial for both of us. This helps build trust and encourage acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I am unable to meet the price of $950,000. I am still committed to finding a solution within my budget of $800,000. Therefore, I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $875,000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable and allow us to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the limit:** Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  There's very little room for negotiation to get a significantly better deal.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag out the process and potentially lead to a lower offer, or even a stalemate.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees a profit of $1,000,000, which is a safe and reliable option considering the limited potential for further gain with Bob. 

While it's tempting to try for a slightly better price, the risk of losing a significant amount of money by further negotiation outweighs the potential benefits.  Selling to John provides a secure and profitable outcome."
