"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $850,000 for your product. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your budget constraints, $850,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the true value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I am unable to meet the price of $950,000. I am still committed to finding a solution within my budget of $800,000. Therefore, I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $875,000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable and allow us to reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
