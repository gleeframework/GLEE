Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but $18,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $17,500, but that's my final offer. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to be within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500.

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $17,500 is a solid profit above your minimum ($15,000).
* **Bob's Limit:**  His language (""final offer,"" ""need to be within my budget"") suggests he's unlikely to go higher.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging out the negotiation risks losing the deal altogether, pushing you to John's lower offer."
