"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. While $12,000 is my minimum, I can still try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer, but $12,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15,000.  This is still a great deal for such a valuable product. Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15000, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $13,500 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $14,250? This feels like a fair price, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $14250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. There are still a few rounds left, and I think I can convince Bob to pay more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping for a little bit more. How about we settle at $13,750? It's a compromise, and it's a price I can live with. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'll meet you halfway between $13750 and $13000, so I'll offer $13375. That's my final counteroffer, can you accept it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,375
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to accept his offer now than risk losing him and ending up selling to John for my minimum."
