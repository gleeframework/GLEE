"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $18000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your offer, but $12000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $15000.  This is still a great deal for such a valuable product. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $15000, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $13500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $13500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $14250? This feels like a fair price, and we can both walk away happy.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $14250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping for a little bit more. How about we settle at $13750? It's a compromise, and it's a price I can live with. Let's close this deal.",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'll meet you halfway between $13750 and $13000, so I'll offer $13375. That's my final counteroffer, can you accept it?",13375.0,Bob,8,
