Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here.  How about $115?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice seems pretty firm on her price, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $115.  It's better to secure the product from John at $100 and avoid the risk of the negotiation failing."
