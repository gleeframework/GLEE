"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000. Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. How about we meet a bit closer to the middle and settle at $9,500? I'm eager to make this purchase, and I think this is a fair offer.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to offer $9,600, but that's my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I might need to explore other options.",9600.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,600 is still just a little too low for me.  To close this deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $9,800.  That's my final offer.  Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",9800.0,Alice,7,
