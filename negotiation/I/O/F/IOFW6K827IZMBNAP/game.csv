,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I can meet you halfway at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit above $110. How about $98? I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",98.0,Bob,4,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $92.50. I'll make one final offer: $100. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,9,
