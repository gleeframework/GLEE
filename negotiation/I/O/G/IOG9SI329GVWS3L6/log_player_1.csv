Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it at a price significantly lower than its worth to me. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential gain for Bob by emphasizing the difference between the price and his estimated worth.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm using language that indicates willingness to discuss the price further. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a profitable sale. 
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own.  
* **If I'm not satisfied with negotiations:** I have the option of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. That's still a significant discount from your original price, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).** Accepting it would mean losing a considerable amount of money.
* **While there's potential for negotiation, Bob's initial counteroffer shows he's willing to play hardball.**  I need to leverage my position and try to push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,300,000. 
* I'll carefully consider Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If negotiations stall or become too unfavorable, I'm ready to sell to John for my minimum price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,000,000 is a tempting offer, it's simply not feasible for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which still represents a good deal for you, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but making it clear that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm offering a price that's still a significant discount from my initial offer but higher than Bob's.  
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more to me, which justifies a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully secured a profitable sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, make a further counteroffer, or sell to John.
* **If negotiations stall:** I'm prepared to move on to John and secure my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,200,000, but I'm still not sure that's a good fit for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).**  It's getting closer, but it's not enough to make a deal.
* **Selling to John is still the more profitable option.**  I can't risk losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000 by accepting Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my previous offer of $1,200,000.**  I'll try to bridge the gap and find a solution that works for both of us.
* **If Bob rejects my counteroffer or continues to offer prices that are too low, I'll proceed with selling to John.**  My priority is to secure the best possible deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $950,000 is simply not a feasible price for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000.  This is a substantial discount from my initial price and a great deal for you. Let's see if we can finalize this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm aiming to find a middle ground between my last offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's latest offer ($950,000).
* **Maintaining Profitability:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's a compromise that allows for a decent profit without risking a sale to John.
* **Finality:** I'm using language that suggests this is my final offer, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've successfully negotiated a good deal and secured a sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll weigh my options carefully:
    * **Accept John's offer:** This is the most profitable option, but I might lose the opportunity to potentially earn more in the future if Bob comes back with a better offer.
    * **Make one final counteroffer:**  I could make a small concession to reach an agreement with Bob, but I need to be mindful of my minimum acceptable price.
    * **End negotiations:**  If Bob continues to refuse my offers, it's time to move on and accept John's offer."
