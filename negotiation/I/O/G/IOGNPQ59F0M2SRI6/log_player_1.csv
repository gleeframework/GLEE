"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true value and potential."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number ($2,250,000), you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point, potentially influencing Bob to offer a higher counter-offer than if you started lower. 
* **Confidence:** A strong initial offer conveys confidence in the product's value.

It's important to remember that this is just the first step in a multi-round negotiation. We'll adjust our approach based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly below both our valuation and his own stated value of the product. Accepting this would mean a substantial loss. We know John is waiting with our baseline acceptable offer, but it's worth seeing if we can negotiate with Bob further.  We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, your offer is quite a ways off from what I can accept. This product holds significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I'm proposing $1,950,000.  This feels like a good point for us to find common ground."", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significantly Higher Counter:** Bob's lowball offer needs to be met with a strong counter that reinforces the product's value. While we're coming down from our initial price, we're still aiming high to provide negotiation room.
* **Justification:** We're giving a brief reason for our counter, emphasizing fairness and the product's inherent value.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** The tone suggests a willingness to negotiate further while still holding firm to a strong position. 

We're starting to apply pressure by closing the gap more slowly, but we're still open to Bob's response in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I need a lower price.  How about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We're making progress, but walking away with John's guaranteed offer is looking more appealing. We'll continue negotiating, but with increased urgency in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, but that's my best offer.  I need to make a decision soon as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Concession:** We're making another significant concession to signal that we're willing to close the deal, but we're also setting a firmer tone.
* **Introducing Time Pressure:** By mentioning ""other interested buyers,"" we create a sense of urgency without completely revealing our alternative (John).  This might encourage Bob to move closer to our price.
* **Final Offer Signal (almost):** While not explicitly our ""final offer,"" we're strongly hinting that we're nearing our limit. This depends heavily on Bob's response in the next round. 

This is a critical juncture in the negotiation. We're pushing for Bob to make a serious move, while also preparing for the possibility of walking away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but that price is still too high for me. I can do $1,350,000. This is a fair offer, considering I could go with another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, as Bob is getting closer to our minimum, and he's introduced his own time pressure by mentioning ""another seller"" (likely a bluff). However,  we're still $150,000 away from our goal, and we have some leverage.

* **Maintaining Credibility:** If we cave too quickly after introducing time pressure ourselves, we risk appearing untruthful, potentially undermining our position. 
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By rejecting, we're seeing how serious Bob is. If his other seller was a strong alternative, he might have taken our previous offer.

We're moving into a riskier phase where a firm counter is needed. We'll use the next round to try one last time to bridge the gap significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we both have other options, and it seems we're still apart on price.  To be completely transparent, my absolute lowest is $1,600,000. I'm offering you this price because I believe you see the real value in this product. If we can't agree here, we'll have to explore those other options."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're explicitly stating this is our ""absolute lowest,"" leaving no room for interpretation.
* **Transparency and Justification:** By mentioning our own options and emphasizing Bob's understanding of the product's value, we're justifying our position and making a final appeal to his business sense.
* **Clear Consequence:** We're stating that failure to agree means walking away. This removes any ambiguity and puts the decision firmly in Bob's hands.

This is a calculated risk. Bob might walk away, but it's our best shot at maximizing profit while still securing a deal above our minimum. We're prepared to walk away and work with John if needed."
