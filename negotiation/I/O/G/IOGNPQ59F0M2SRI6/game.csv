"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me, I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, your offer is quite a ways off from what I can accept. This product holds significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I'm proposing $1,950,000.  This feels like a good point for us to find common ground.",1950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, but that's my best offer.  I need to make a decision soon as I have other interested buyers.",1750000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but that price is still too high for me. I can do $1,350,000. This is a fair offer, considering I could go with another seller.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we both have other options, and it seems we're still apart on price.  To be completely transparent, my absolute lowest is $1,600,000. I'm offering you this price because I believe you see the real value in this product. If we can't agree here, we'll have to explore those other options.",1600000.0,Alice,7,
