Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, your offer is quite a ways off from what I can accept. This product holds significant value, and to be fair to both of us, I'm proposing $1,950,000.  This feels like a good point for us to find common ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000, but that's my best offer.  I need to make a decision soon as I have other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have other buyers, but that price is still too high for me. I can do $1,350,000. This is a fair offer, considering I could go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 1350000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we both have other options, and it seems we're still apart on price.  To be completely transparent, my absolute lowest is $1,600,000. I'm offering you this price because I believe you see the real value in this product. If we can't agree here, we'll have to explore those other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Reason: While Alice has come down in price, she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,600,000. Knowing John will sell the product for $1,500,000, it's more beneficial to secure that price now rather than risk Alice sticking to her ""absolute lowest"" offer."
