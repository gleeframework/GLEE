"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $130. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While it's a bit above Alice's value, $130 is still a better price than the $150 John is offering. Accepting this offer saves Bob $20."
