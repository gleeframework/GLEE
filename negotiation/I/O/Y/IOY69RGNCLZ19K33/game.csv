"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is below my bottom line.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's a fantastic deal for a product you won't find anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a good deal, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $900,000. How about we meet at $825,000? That's a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise.",825000.0,Bob,4,
