{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for Bob to bargain. It's also a price that is significantly lower than what the product is worth to him, giving him incentive to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget, I am willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of this product to you, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that's mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
