{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. My initial price is $175. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $150. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and stating that I believe the product is valuable to Bob. This sets a positive tone.
* **Strategy:** My goal is to maximize profit. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay more than $80 but less than $175, giving us both a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is offering significantly less than my minimum acceptable price.
* **John's Offer:** John is willing to pay my minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategy:** While I could accept Bob's offer and get something, it's not worth sacrificing a good deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if he's willing to come up, or I'll sell to John for a more favorable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit to $140. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll find this product to be well worth it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm coming down to $140, still above my minimum but demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing a ""fair price"" and highlighting the product's value to Bob. This keeps the conversation constructive.
* **Strategy:** I'm pushing Bob closer to my minimum while leaving some room for further negotiation if necessary.  If he doesn't budge, I can still sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to go up to $100, which is a good middle ground for us both. Let's see if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

* **John's Offer:** John is still willing to pay my minimum price of $150.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $100 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to go down to $125, which is a significant compromise on my part. This offer is still within my acceptable range and I believe it's fair for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

* **Price:**  I'm lowering my price again, but still above my minimum of $150. I'm trying to signal that I'm flexible, but not desperate.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $110 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $117.50.
