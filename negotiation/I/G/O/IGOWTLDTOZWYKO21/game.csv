"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $850,000. However, I was thinking of a price a bit closer to the value it holds for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $900,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $980,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me.",980000.0,Alice,5,
