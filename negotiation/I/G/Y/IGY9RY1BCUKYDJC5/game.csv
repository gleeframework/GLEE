"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm offering the product to you for $1,400,000. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,400,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and my available resources. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower than that. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand we're close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I need to make a bit more profit on this deal. I'm thinking of a price of $1,320,000. It's a small increase, but I believe it's still a fair compromise. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,320,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,280,000, which is closer to my budget and represents a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement on this round.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,280,000 and $1,320,000, which would be $1,300,000. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I'm thinking of a price of $1,310,000. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1310000.0,Alice,7,
