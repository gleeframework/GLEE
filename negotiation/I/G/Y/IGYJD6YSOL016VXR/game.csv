"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for sale. I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great value from it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $20,000 was a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking more along the lines of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm happy to pay $14,000 for the product. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000, but I'm willing to get closer to your price. I'm thinking $16,000 is a fair price for this product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,
