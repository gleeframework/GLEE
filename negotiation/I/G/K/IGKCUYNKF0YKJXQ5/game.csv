"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it, which I believe is a fair price.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $13500. It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
