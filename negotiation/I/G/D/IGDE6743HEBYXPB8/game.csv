"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $10,500 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better price on a product like this.  What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,875?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still getting you a great price. What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,5,
