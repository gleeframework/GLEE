Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is above Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a decent profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and sets the stage for negotiation. It emphasizes the value of the product to me, implying a potential for a good deal for Bob. 

This initial offer is strategic. It's high enough to potentially entice Bob, while also leaving room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I want to close a deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than what I know the product is worth. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,250:** This is a counteroffer that's a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $10,500. It's a fair price that might be more appealing to Bob while still leaving me with a decent profit.
* **Message:** The message remains friendly and highlights the value of the product. It also emphasizes the compromise aspect of my counteroffer, making it more likely for Bob to accept."
