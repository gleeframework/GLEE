Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $12,000.**  I know I can get this from John if Bob rejects.
* **I want to maximize my profit.**  I'm aiming for a higher price, but I need to be mindful of Bob's potential valuation.
* **$15,000 is a reasonable starting point.**  It's a significant markup from my minimum, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected.

If Bob rejects, I'll be happy to sell to John for $12,000. But, there's always a chance Bob will find the value proposition good enough to accept my offer."
