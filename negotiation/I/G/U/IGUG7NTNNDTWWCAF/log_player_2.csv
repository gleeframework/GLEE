"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counteroffering. There are still 9 rounds left, giving Bob ample opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a moderate counteroffer, showing he's willing to negotiate but also highlighting his desire for a lower price.  This allows for potential further negotiation while keeping the deal within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  Let's try to reach a deal that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's preferred price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price, potentially securing a better deal. There are still 7 rounds remaining, providing sufficient time to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to pay $9,250.  Let's try to close this deal.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to push for a lower price, but this time with a smaller increment. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still pursuing a good deal.  He also reinforces his desire to close the deal, potentially encouraging Alice to accept."
