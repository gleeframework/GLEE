"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $9,000 for it, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
