"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",105.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a little high for me.  I'm happy to pay $100 for the product.  That's fair for both of us, and it saves us both time.",100.0,Bob,4,,
