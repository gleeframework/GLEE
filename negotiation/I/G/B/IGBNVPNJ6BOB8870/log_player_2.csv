Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, but it's getting closer. I'll reject and try to negotiate further."

Alice is adamant on $10,500, which is still higher than my budget. I'm better off buying the product from John for $10,000.  It's not ideal, but it's the best deal I can get right now."
