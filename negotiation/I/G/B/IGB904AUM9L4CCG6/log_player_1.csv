I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident that I can get at least my minimum of $15,000 from John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is close to my initial asking price and significantly higher than what I could get from John. Accepting his offer ensures a good deal for me."
