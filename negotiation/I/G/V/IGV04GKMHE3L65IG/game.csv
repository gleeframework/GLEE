"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider something closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,150,000. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,150,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in negotiations. I can see you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,075,000. I can meet you at $1,125,000, which is my absolute minimum. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the response. I understand this is your bottom line, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $1,125,000.  My absolute maximum is $1,100,000.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal.",1100000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,120,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm not sure I can go any higher without losing money on this deal. What do you think?",1120000.0,Alice,7,
