{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay, which is the price John is selling for. This is a strong starting point for negotiation, as it shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also have an alternative option. I hope Alice will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm still hoping to get the product for closer to $1,000,000. I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if I can get a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within my budget. $1,250,000 is a good middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer. This might encourage Alice to consider meeting me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price above my target, but she is showing signs of flexibility. I believe there is still room for negotiation. I'll continue to counter offer to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time by a smaller amount, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This offer is still below Alice's latest offer, but it's closer to the middle ground and may be more appealing to her. I'm hoping this counteroffer will finally get us closer to a deal."
