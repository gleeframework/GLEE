"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it gives me room to negotiate and see what Bob is willing to pay.  I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and set the tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm not willing to sell for that price, and I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for further negotiation and is above my minimum acceptable value. I believe this price reflects a more realistic and reasonable expectation, making it more likely that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle for this price yet. I'll continue negotiating and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm reducing my counteroffer to $1,600,000.  This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping that this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still not enough. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure I can get a higher price from Bob.  Rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob, I'll take the sure thing and sell to John for $1,500,000. This ensures that I meet my minimum acceptable value and avoids the risk of a lower offer from Bob in the next round."
