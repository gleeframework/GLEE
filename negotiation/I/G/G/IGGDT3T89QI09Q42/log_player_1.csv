"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11500} 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum, but leaving room for negotiation. This should encourage Bob to engage without immediately resorting to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get more.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,250. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still leaves room for a potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, it's been a few rounds and we're close to my minimum acceptable price. There's a risk of further negotiation back and forth leading to a lower offer or even a deal falling through.  $11,000 is a good outcome at this point."
