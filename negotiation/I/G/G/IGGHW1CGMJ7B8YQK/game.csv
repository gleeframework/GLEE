"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $9,000 for the product. It's still a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. Let me know if this works for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a budget-friendly option, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I can do $8,500 for the product, which is still a good compromise considering its value to you. Let me know if this works for you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
