"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above your personal value of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have room to negotiate a lower price. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $130 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $115 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $115. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $122? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your range:**  $122 is still below your maximum price of $150. 
* **Further negotiation is risky:** While you could try to get a lower price, it's possible Alice might reject again, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Acceptance is a good compromise:** Accepting Alice's offer gets you the product at a good price and avoids further negotiation risk."
