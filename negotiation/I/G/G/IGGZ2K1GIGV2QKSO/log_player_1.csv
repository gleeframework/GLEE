Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

This is a high starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to see how much Bob values the product. If he's truly interested, he'll likely counter with a lower price.  I'm prepared to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but it's still a bit low. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's above my minimum. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting.  Further negotiation might get me a slightly higher price, but the risk of him walking away entirely is too high. $1,850,000 is a good deal and secures the sale."
