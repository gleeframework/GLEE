``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Alice's offer:** You get the product for $1,000,000, saving $200,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer:**  You'll end up buying from John for $1,200,000, which is the highest price.
* **Buying from John:** This is the most expensive option, so it's not the best choice.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous option."
