"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm confident it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $150, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125? I think that's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $125 is a bit steep. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round.  I want to see if I can close the deal for closer to my initial offer of $125."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's settle on $120. That's my absolute minimum, and it still represents a good value for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $120. How about we try $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob aren't progressing towards a price I'm comfortable with. I've already made several concessions and Bob is still pushing for a price lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  At this point, it's better for me to sell the product to John for $120 and avoid further rounds of negotiation that may not result in a better outcome."
