Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, leaving room for negotiation while still making a deal more appealing to Bob than walking away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  This price is closer to your minimum but still leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message highlights the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price, even though you know it's worth less to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The wording implies a willingness to discuss further, encouraging Bob to engage.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob to be a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower within the ZOPA.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a more accommodating price."
