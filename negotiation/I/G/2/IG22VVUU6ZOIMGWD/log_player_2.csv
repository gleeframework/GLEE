"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $600,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can likely get the product for a lower price by counteroffering. $600,000 is a good starting point, but there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 500000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a revised price of $550,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.

Alice has come down to $550,000, which is a good deal for you.  It's still less than John's price, and you can potentially get a better deal with more negotiation.  However, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and you'll be stuck with John's higher price.  Accepting the offer is a good balance of risk and reward."
