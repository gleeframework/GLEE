"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $11500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $10500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more than $10500. How about $11000?  That's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, I'm not quite ready to settle on $10750. How about $10900?  That's a small step closer to my original offer, and it gives you a great price on a valuable product.",10900.0,Alice,5,
