"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $15000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle at $10000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a more comfortable price for you, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I can meet you halfway, but I need to add a bit more to the price. How about we meet at $12500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9000? I'm trying to be reasonable here, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $11000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,5,
