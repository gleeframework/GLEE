"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while allowing you to acquire it at a reasonable cost. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $12,000 is lower than Alice's initial value, it's significantly higher than your $8,000 limit and John's offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects my budget constraints."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's important to start with a price that reflects your desired range. 
* **Polite and Respectful:** The message maintains a positive tone and acknowledges Alice's position while clearly stating your budget constraints.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer gives Alice space to counter and potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. After considering your offer, I am unable to accept $6,000 for the product. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to your acceptable price, but it's still above what John is offering.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $7,500?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $7,500, you're splitting the difference between Alice's current offer ($9,000) and your target price ($6,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still moving closer to your goal. 
* **Positive Language:**  The message continues to be friendly and optimistic, emphasizing a ""win-win"" solution.
* **Sense of Urgency (Optional):** You could subtly add a touch of urgency by mentioning that you're evaluating other options (without explicitly mentioning John). This might encourage Alice to accept your offer more quickly."
