"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity to sell you a valuable product, and I'm excited to discuss the details with you. I believe you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is the maximum you're willing to pay. There's no point in accepting it when you can try to negotiate a lower price.  You have plenty of rounds to work with, so you'll reject and prepare a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Start Low:**  Beginning with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Interested:**  Maintain a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable. Expressing interest in the product encourages Alice to continue bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. While $10,500 is closer to a reasonable price, we're aiming to save as much as possible. Let's see if we can get her closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Direct Counter:**  We're aiming for a price around $9,000, so we'll propose it directly.
* **Sense of Compromise:**  Using phrases like ""meet in the middle"" reinforces the idea that we are both making concessions to reach a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $9,500 for the product, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting serious by stating this is her lowest offer, but we're only $500 away from our ideal price. With several rounds left, it's worth pushing a little further, even if it might be a slight risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $9,500 is very tempting, and I appreciate you coming down.  Would you be willing to settle at $9,250? I'm ready to close the deal today at that price."",
""product_price"": 9250
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Show Willingness to Close:**  By stating you're ""ready to close the deal today,"" you signal that this is a serious offer.
* **Small Concession:** Meeting her halfway between her last offer and your target price shows you're willing to compromise, but still want the best possible deal.
* **Time Pressure (Subtle):** Using ""today"" adds a touch of time pressure without being overly aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, Bob, but I need to think about the costs and risks involved. I can do $9,500 is too low, but I can do $9,750, and that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice is firm on her price and we're running out of rounds. Accepting at $9,750 gets us a decent discount from both her starting price and John's offer.  Continuing to push risks either:

* **Stalemate:** Alice might not budge further, wasting rounds.
* **Losing the Deal:**  She could get frustrated and end negotiations, forcing us to John's full price.

This offer is a reasonable compromise at this stage."
