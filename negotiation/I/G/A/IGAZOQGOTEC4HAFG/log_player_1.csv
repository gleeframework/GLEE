Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $1,200,000 would be more reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While he's clearly willing to negotiate, his offer is far too low. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still finding it a bit steep. Would you consider $1,350,000? I feel that's a fair compromise that reflects the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value our ongoing conversation,  $1,350,000 is still below the product's true worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000.  This price represents a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the product's value.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
