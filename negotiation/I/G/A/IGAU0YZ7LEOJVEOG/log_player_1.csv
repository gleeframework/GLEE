Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, and I'm willing to let it go for $15,000. This is a great deal considering its true value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, she should aim higher with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Alice's minimum. 
* **Value Highlighting:** The message emphasizes the product's worth, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy provides the best chance of maximizing profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
