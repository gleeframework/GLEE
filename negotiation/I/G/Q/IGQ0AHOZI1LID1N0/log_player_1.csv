Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $15000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is closer to $8000.  Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. How about $12,000?  That's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's right at my minimum acceptable value, it's more than what John is offering, and I'm confident I can still get a good deal."
