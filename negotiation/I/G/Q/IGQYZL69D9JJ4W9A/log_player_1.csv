Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for you.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob before moving on to your guaranteed sale.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  Since you have a guaranteed sale, you can afford to be a little bolder. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  You project value by stating your confidence in the product's worth.
* **Exclusive Opportunity:** This subtly implies scarcity, even though you have John as a backup.
* **Strong Price:** $1,350,000 leaves you with a significant profit margin while still offering Bob a substantial discount from his perceived value.

**Important Note:** This is just one possible offer. You could adjust the price slightly up or down depending on your risk tolerance and how confident you are in Bob's eagerness to buy."
