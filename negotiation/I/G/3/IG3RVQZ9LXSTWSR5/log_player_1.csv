"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $90. It's a little higher than Bob's perceived value, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll see what kind of counteroffer he makes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I won't accept $75, as I won't make a profit and I am willing to go through a few more rounds of negotiation.  I'll see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85 as a compromise. It's still a bit higher than Bob's offer but closer to my desired price.  Hopefully, he'll be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price point.  I can accept this offer and secure a sale.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee of a better outcome and I risk losing time and potentially the sale altogether."
