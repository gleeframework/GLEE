Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is unique, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  To be honest, $1,600,000 is still a big stretch for me. Would you consider $900,000? It's a significant jump from my last offer, and I think it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to move up to $950,000.  This is my final offer, as I think it's more than fair considering John is offering the same for $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is aware of John's offer and is using it as leverage. His increases are minimal, and he's stated this is his final offer. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, making John's guaranteed $1,000,000 the more profitable option at this point."
