"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to get the product at a lower price, and I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like. How about $11,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm really looking forward to getting this product.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better price, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15,000.
