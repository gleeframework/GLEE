Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum acceptable price is $12,000.**  If Bob rejects, I can sell to John for that amount.
* **I'm aiming higher to maximize profit.**  By offering $15,000, I'm giving Bob a potential good deal, but still leaving myself room for a larger profit than the minimum. 
* **I don't know Bob's value for the product.**  This price allows for some negotiation if he finds it too high, and leaves open the possibility of a higher price if he's willing to pay more."
