Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your initial valuation and within my price range.
