Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,200,000.  This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have leverage to start high.  A significantly higher initial offer leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum price. 
* **Time pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency can encourage a quicker decision from Bob. 
* **Justification:** While not overly detailed, mentioning the ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces the justification for the high price. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** You get a fantastic deal, significantly exceeding your minimum.
* **Bob negotiates:** This opens the door for you to gauge his interest and potentially settle on a price still well above $800,000.
* **Bob rejects:** You haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at your guaranteed price."
