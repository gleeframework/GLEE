Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product, but my budget is limited. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your follow-up offer. While I understand the value of your product, I am still unable to meet you at $12,500. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to my budget of $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems firm on his $10,000 offer. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.  Selling to John guarantees the $12,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking a lower final price."
