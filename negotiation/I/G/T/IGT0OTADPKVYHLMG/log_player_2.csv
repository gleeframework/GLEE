"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you.  I've determined the price to be $900000. This represents a significant gain for you, as it's significantly less than the $1000000 you value it at. Let me know if you're interested, as I'm confident this is a deal you won't want to miss. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
