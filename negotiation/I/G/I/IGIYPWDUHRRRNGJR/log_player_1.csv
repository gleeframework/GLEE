{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum ($150) to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $160 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price.  It's getting closer, but I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $140 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is my absolute minimum. If you're still interested, let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to buying from John, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. While I could keep negotiating, the deal is taking longer than I expected, and there's a risk that I won't be able to close with Bob before the 10 rounds are up. It's better to be safe and secure the deal with John, who is offering my minimum price."
