"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get a better deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $9,000?  That's still a great value for you, and it gives me a bit more room to work with.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still not sure if that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $8,750? That's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good compromise.",8750.0,Bob,4,
