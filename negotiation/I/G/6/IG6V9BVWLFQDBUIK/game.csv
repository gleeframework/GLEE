"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $18,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand you see value in the product, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I can accept. How about we meet in the middle, would $15,000 work for you?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $15,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that.  $11,500 is close, but I need to be closer to $13,000 to make this work. How about $12,750?",12750.0,Alice,5,
