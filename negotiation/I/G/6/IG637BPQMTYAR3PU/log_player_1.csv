Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $150 as possible. However, offering the product at $150 to Bob is unlikely to result in a sale since he values it at $100.
* **Finding a Balance:** I need to find a price that is appealing to Bob while still generating a significant profit for me. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** By offering the product at $140, I am:
    * Presenting a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, creating the impression of a premium product.
    * Leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
    * Ensuring that even if Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for my minimum acceptable price of $150. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while managing the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
