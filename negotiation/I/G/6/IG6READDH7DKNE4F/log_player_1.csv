Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start with a high offer to see where Bob's negotiation range is. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 1,500,000}

I'm hoping to get at least $1,000,000 for the product, so I'm starting with a price that's slightly above that. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's initial offer is lower than my target price, but it's still a significant amount. I'll decide to reject his offer and make a counteroffer to try to get closer to my target price.

My counteroffer:

{""product_price"": 1,350,000}

I'm reducing the price by $150,000 from my initial offer, but still trying to stay above Bob's offer. Let's see how he responds!"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll respond to Bob's counteroffer with a new one. Since Bob's offer was $1,200,000, I'll increase the price by $50,000 and make a counteroffer of:
