Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $125 is a reasonable compromise. It's a $25 profit, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether."
