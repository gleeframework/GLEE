"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $825,000? That's still a great price for a product worth $800,000 to you, and it's closer to what I need to get. Let's make this happen!",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $775,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is the minimum I can accept. This price reflects the true value of the product for you. Let's finalize this deal, and we both can be happy.",800000.0,Alice,5,
