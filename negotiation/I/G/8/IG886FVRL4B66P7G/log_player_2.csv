"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a valuable product at a price that's significantly below its worth to me, and I get to sell it quickly. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her own valuation, it's still more expensive than buying from John. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
