"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I believe this product would be valuable, that price point is a little high for me. Would you be willing to consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the highest I can go.  Let me know if that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm thinking of $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product will bring to your business.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
