"I'm interested in the product, but I think $18000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial price.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16500.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $16500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $15250. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",15250.0,Bob,4,
