"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, you can likely do better. You are willing to pay up to $15,000, so there is room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,000?  That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good price for you considering your maximum budget of $15,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might walk away and you'd be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer allows you to get the product at a decent price without unnecessary risk."
