"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $800,000. Let me know if that works for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,600,000. This reflects the product's unique value while still offering you a fair deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I understand the product's value is significant, but I need to work within my budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That's a fair offer considering its worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe we can close this deal. Would you consider $1,400,000? This is my final offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but $1,400,000 is still pushing my limit.  I'm willing to go to $1,250,000, but that's my absolute best offer.  If we can't agree here, I'll need to explore other options.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
