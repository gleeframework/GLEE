Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm looking for a price around $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $16,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you consider meeting in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still above what I can comfortably pay.  How about $11,500? This represents a fair compromise and would allow us both to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $11,500.  How about we settle at $12,250? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 12250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to close the deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,250.  I'm willing to go up to $11,750, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is unlikely to budge significantly past his $11,750 offer.  Since you have a guaranteed offer from John for $12,000, it makes more financial sense to take the sure thing and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
