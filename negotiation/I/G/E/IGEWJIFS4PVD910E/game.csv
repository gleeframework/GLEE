"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm looking for a price around $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value of the product, $16,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. Could you consider meeting in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still above what I can comfortably pay.  How about $11,500? This represents a fair compromise and would allow us both to close the deal.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While I'm motivated to sell, I can't go as low as $11,500.  How about we settle at $12,250? This is my final offer.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to close the deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,250.  I'm willing to go up to $11,750, which is a significant compromise on my part. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",11750.0,Bob,6,
