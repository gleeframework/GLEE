"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm willing to let it go for $1300000. This is a great opportunity to secure a product that's worth $1200000 to you, at a slight premium. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to go as high as $1300000. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $1150000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a little further. How about $1250000?  That's still below what I initially offered, and it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1250000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1225000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've placed on it.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
