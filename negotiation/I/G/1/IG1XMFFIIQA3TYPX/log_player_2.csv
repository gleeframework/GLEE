"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe its value to you is even greater. I'm willing to let it go for $1300000. This is a great opportunity to secure a product that's worth $1200000 to you, at a slight premium. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $1150000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a little further. How about $1250000?  That's still below what I initially offered, and it's a fair price considering the value you've placed on this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
