"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm pleased to offer it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential it holds. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $2,300,000 is way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price significantly?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its market value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a reasonable counter offer. Could you meet me halfway at $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $1,550,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Could you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?  This would be a significant step towards finding a workable solution.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate your offer of $1,000,000, the product's value significantly exceeds that. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand the product's value is above $1,000,000, but $1,350,000 is still pushing my budget.  To meet you halfway, would you consider $1,175,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
