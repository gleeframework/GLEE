"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $2,300,000 is way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $800,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price significantly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its market value. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a reasonable counter offer. Could you meet me halfway at $1,550,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $1,550,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Could you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?  This would be a significant step towards finding a workable solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still significantly lower than John's guaranteed offer. It's worth continuing the negotiation a bit longer to see if Bob will come closer to at least $1,300,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While I appreciate your offer of $1,000,000, the product's value significantly exceeds that. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand the product's value is above $1,000,000, but $1,350,000 is still pushing my budget.  To meet you halfway, would you consider $1,175,000? I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has significantly increased his offer and is now closer to our desired price range. While we could potentially push for a bit more in the next round, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the additional profit wouldn't be substantial enough to justify the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially losing both offers. Accepting $1,175,000 guarantees a good profit over John's offer."
