Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $11,000. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a great opportunity to acquire it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price higher than John's offer ($12,000) but appealing to Bob.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Starting at $11,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Creating Value Perception:** Highlighting a ""special price"" and the product's value to Bob can encourage him to accept.

This approach seeks to strike a balance between maximizing potential earnings from Bob while securing a sale above your minimum acceptable price."
