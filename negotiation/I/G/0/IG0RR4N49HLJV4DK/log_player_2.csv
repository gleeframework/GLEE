"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I believe is worth at least $12,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $10,000, while John is asking for $12,000. 
* **The offer is within your budget:** You're willing to spend up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John."
