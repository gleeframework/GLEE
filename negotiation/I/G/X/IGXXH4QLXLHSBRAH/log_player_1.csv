Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $100, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $130 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer, to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm going to counter with $140. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this will be a more appealing price for Bob, while still giving me a profit that's higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $135. While I initially hoped for a higher price, the negotiation has gone back and forth, and I'm satisfied with this outcome. It's a good profit margin for me, and I'd rather sell to Bob now than risk a further negotiation that could potentially result in a lower price."
