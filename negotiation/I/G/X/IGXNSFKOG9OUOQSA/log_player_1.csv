Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price ($1,100,000) that's still lower than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  I'm not going for the maximum right away, as this encourages Bob to counter and keeps the negotiation active.
* **Building a Relationship:** Starting with a friendly message can help build rapport, leading to a more successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $900,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I believe there's room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price. 
* **Avoiding a Quick Sale:** Selling to John for $800,000 would be a safe option, but I'm aiming for a better deal.  

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still leaves room for you to benefit from the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while staying above my minimum value. 
* **Emphasize Benefits:** I highlight the benefits Bob will gain, reminding him of the value the product holds for him. 
* **Staying Open:** The message conveys a willingness to negotiate further, leaving the door open for more back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Value:** $950,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. It's a significant improvement over Bob's initial offer. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, it's unlikely that Bob will budge much further. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a stalemate. 
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and may not lead to a significantly better result.

**Conclusion:**  It's a good deal, and I'm comfortable closing the deal with Bob at this price."
