"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her, closer to her $800,000 valuation."
