"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I'm willing to make a one-time deal for you. I'll sell it to you for $14,000, which is a great price considering its value to you is $10,000. It's a win-win! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum valuation and what John offers. It makes no sense to accept a price that's $4,000 more than you're willing to pay."
