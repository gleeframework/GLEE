"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting high with $20,000. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is truly interested and potentially willing to pay a premium. I'm leaving room to negotiate downwards if needed, but I want to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $13,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While $14,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a slightly higher price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering $16,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my ideal value. Since Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, I'm hoping he'll meet me in the middle this time."
