Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This gives Bob a decent discount while still leaving me a significant profit margin.  I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It's still a good price for me, but it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and hopefully encourages Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to sell the product for significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I get my minimum and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
