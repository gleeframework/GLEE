Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,750,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant premium over my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to him, I'm not willing to go that far below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above my minimum price. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum price. While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking the deal further. I'll accept his offer and move on."
