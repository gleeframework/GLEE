Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to $120 as possible while still enticing Bob to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $100, so offering it above that but below your minimum acceptable price creates a potential win-win.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $120 gives you leverage. You don't need to go below your minimum price. 

This offer gives Bob a chance to gain some value ($100 value for him at a price of $115) while still netting you a profit above your minimum."
