**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. I can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my price, there's still room for negotiation.  I can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.  $900,000 is still too high, and I believe I can get a lower price."
