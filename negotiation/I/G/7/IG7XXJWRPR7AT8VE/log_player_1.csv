Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It's assertive:**  You're confident in the product's worth, but also open to discussion.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit. Be prepared to adjust your offer depending on Bob's response and to potentially walk away if a better deal isn't possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is close to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price.  You want to see if you can push for a higher price. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter and potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant compromise. This price still offers you a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there with $900,000. How about we split the difference and go with $875,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000 and is closer to your desired price. Accepting this offer allows you to secure a sale and maximize your profit in this situation."
