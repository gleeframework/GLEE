"I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can you meet me in the middle?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8500? It's a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $8500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7000 and $8500. How about $7750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $7750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm ready to make a final compromise.  How about $8250? This is really my best offer, but I'm confident it's a price that will make us both happy.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $7500, and I think that's a fair price for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",7500.0,Bob,6,
