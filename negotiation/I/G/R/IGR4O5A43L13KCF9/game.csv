"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit too rich for me right now. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more realistic.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but that price is still a bit steep for me. How about $700,000? That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and your interest in it.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $750,000, which is $825,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and your interest in it.",825000.0,Alice,7,
