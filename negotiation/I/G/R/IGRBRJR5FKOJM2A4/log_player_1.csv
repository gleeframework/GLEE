Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $11,500. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Offering it slightly below John's offer creates an incentive for Bob.
* **Urgency and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and creates a sense of urgency with the limited-time offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $11,500, there might be room for Bob to negotiate slightly upwards, getting Alice closer to her desired price.

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice has no way of knowing for sure that John will buy the product for $12,000. If she has absolute certainty about John's offer, she might be more aggressive with Bob."
