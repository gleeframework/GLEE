"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm starting with a price of $140, but I'm open to discussing it further."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price close to my minimum, but still leaving some room for negotiation.  It's important to leave some wiggle room to be able to adjust my offer later on. I'm also being friendly and positive to create a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me.  How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than $120, I'm still aiming for a higher price closer to my initial offer. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer to show I'm willing to negotiate.  I also want to see how flexible Bob is and if he's truly interested in the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135.  This is a great product, and I think it's worth the extra investment.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $135.  Let's split the difference. How about $132.50?  I think that's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a slightly higher price, $132.50 is a good compromise that is closer to my initial goal. We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too inflexible. It's also important to consider the value of the product to Bob, and he seems genuinely interested in closing the deal."
