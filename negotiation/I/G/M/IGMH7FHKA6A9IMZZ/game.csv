"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, considering its value to me is significantly higher. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750.  This is a fair price that considers both our perspectives. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,875?  This way we can both come to a fair agreement.  Let me know your thoughts.",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,875 is still slightly outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,625. This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to an agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10625.0,Bob,6,
