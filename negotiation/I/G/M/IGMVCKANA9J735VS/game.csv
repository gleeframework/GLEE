"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. Would you be willing to consider that price?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $105 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite comfortable with $95, Bob. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to consider that price?",110.0,Alice,5,
