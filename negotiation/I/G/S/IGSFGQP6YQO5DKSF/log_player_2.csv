"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $115. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is less than what you'd pay John, it's still more than the product is worth to you.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is closer to my desired price of $105 and still below what I would pay John.  It's a good deal for me."
