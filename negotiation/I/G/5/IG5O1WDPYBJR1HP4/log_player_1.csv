Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price slightly below her minimum ($15,000) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($12,000) leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has the security of John as a backup buyer, so she can be a bit more bold with her initial offer to Bob. 

By starting at $14,500, Alice might:

* **Secure a Quick Sale:** Bob might accept immediately, netting Alice a great profit.
* **Open Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, giving Alice a chance to still sell above $15,000 or meet somewhere in the middle."
