"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $13000 for it.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $14500, but I'm still not comfortable selling it for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I can offer it to you for $15500. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
