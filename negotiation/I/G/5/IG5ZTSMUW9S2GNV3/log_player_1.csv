{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed $800,000 from John, so we don't want to go below that.

This offer balances risk and reward. It aims to secure a significant portion of the potential profit while ensuring we don't lose the sale entirely."
