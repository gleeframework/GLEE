**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $925,000.  While that's less than what John would charge, it's still more than the product is worth to you.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John, even though it's a bit more expensive, because you'll save $75,000 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
