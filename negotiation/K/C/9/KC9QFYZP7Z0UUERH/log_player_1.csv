Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

We're getting closer, but I'm still willing to hold out for a better offer from Bob.  I'm aiming to get him closer to my minimum."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to pay $800,000. I'm still thinking more along the lines of $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000

It's becoming clear that Bob is unlikely to meet my minimum price.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $800,000."
