"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can bring to the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for us both, $950,000 undervalues its potential.  How about we meet at $1,050,000? This reflects the value I bring and allows room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $1,050,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll propose $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
