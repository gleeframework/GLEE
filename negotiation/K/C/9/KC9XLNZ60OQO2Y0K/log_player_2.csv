"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its worth, but also allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly starting high. She wants $12,000 for something she values at $8,000. 
* You have room to negotiate. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better price.
* You have a backup plan with John. While not ideal, you know you won't be forced to pay more than $15,000."
