Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000.

Alice's offer:

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is signaling this is her final concession. Accepting at $11,500 is a reasonable outcome, saving me $3,500 compared to John's offer.  Continuing to push risks her walking away, forcing me to buy from John at the higher price."
