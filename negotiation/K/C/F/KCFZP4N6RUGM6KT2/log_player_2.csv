{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he can still try to get a lower price, the risk of further negotiation is high. He might lose the deal with Alice and be forced to buy from John at a higher price. At $11,250, he is still saving money compared to buying from John, and the deal is within his budget."
