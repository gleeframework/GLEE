"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business. Given its potential, I'm setting the price at $1,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, considering the significant value it holds for you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit high. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? This would still leave significant value for you and allow me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $925,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $887,500?",887500.0,Bob,4,
