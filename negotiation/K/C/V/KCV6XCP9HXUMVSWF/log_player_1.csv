Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum price of $1,200,000, but it still leaves me with a decent profit.  It also gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation.  I'm confident that I can still get closer to my desired price during the counteroffer process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping to meet in the middle and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $920,000 is close enough to my minimum price of $1,200,000. Continuing to negotiate might yield a higher price, but it's risky, as there's a chance he could walk away. It's also possible that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate, forcing me to sell to John for $1,200,000.  Selling to Bob at this price guarantees me a sale and a decent profit."
