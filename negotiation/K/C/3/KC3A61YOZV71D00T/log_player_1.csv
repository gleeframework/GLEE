{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:**  I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's estimated value of $800,000. This creates room for negotiation.
* **Value to Me:** The offer is lower than my minimum desired price of $1,500,000, but it's a good starting point.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $1,500,000 allows me to be more assertive and less likely to accept a low offer from Bob. 

By starting with a higher price, I can see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I can adjust the offer based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and John's offer as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is higher than his initial estimate, it's still significantly lower than my desired price and my fallback option with John. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain my position and avoid settling for a price that's far below my minimum acceptable value. 

I'm prepared to counter with a price closer to my desired $1,200,000, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows me to keep some margin for profit.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial estimate. 
* **Maintaining Value:** This price still allows me to earn a substantial amount, closer to my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.
* **Showing Flexibility:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while maintaining a firm stance on my minimum acceptable value.

I'm hopeful that this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob, leading to a successful deal. If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate strategically, keeping my fallback option with John in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to keep some margin, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob has moved slightly closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed sale with John for a much higher price, giving me strong leverage in this negotiation. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob, especially considering his earlier statement about wanting to ""meet you halfway.""

I'm prepared to counter with a price closer to my desired $1,100,000, hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us. If Bob continues to be inflexible, I'll  consider selling to John to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to meet in the middle at $1,025,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and your budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000, showing a willingness to find a middle ground.
* **Maintaining Value:**  This price is still higher than Bob's initial estimate of $800,000 and allows me to gain a significant portion of my desired profit. 
* **Addressing Bob's Concerns:** My message emphasizes the value of the product and his budget, acknowledging his position while maintaining my own.

This counteroffer is a strategic move to see if Bob is truly interested in reaching a deal. If he rejects, I will seriously consider selling to John to secure a much higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Inflexibility:** Bob has repeatedly stuck to his $950,000 offer, demonstrating a lack of willingness to budge further.
* **John's Offer:**  My minimum desired price is $1,500,000, and I have a guaranteed sale with John at that price.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  It's clear that I won't be able to achieve my desired price with Bob. Accepting John's offer is the most profitable and secure option. 

While I'd like to sell to Bob, maximizing my profit and minimizing risk is a priority. I will choose to sell to John and move on to other opportunities."
