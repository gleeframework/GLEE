"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $90. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in the product, my budget is $80. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Bob, and that's the highest price he's willing to pay.  It's better to accept his offer and sell the product for $80 than risk losing him and having to sell to John for the same price."
