Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so you should aim for a price closer to Bob's $1,200,000 valuation. However, being too greedy could lead Bob to reject the offer. 

**The Offer**

Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:** The message is polite, emphasizes the product's value, and positions the price as a ""fair deal.""
* **Price:** $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit for you. It's also $50,000 less than Bob's perceived value, making it more likely he'll accept.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. If he does, try to stay firm but be willing to make small concessions if necessary. You always have the option to walk away and sell to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000."
