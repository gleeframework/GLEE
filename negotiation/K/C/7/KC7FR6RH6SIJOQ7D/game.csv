"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $10,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still make a good profit. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
