Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a high price, but still within reason considering the value to Bob ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value the product provides to Bob to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Open Communication:** I'm inviting Bob to respond and start the negotiation."

Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and I believe there's potential for a better deal.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round and continue negotiating towards a more favorable price.
* **Value of Time:**  I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to decline this offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the value of this product for your business. How about $1,000,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Space:** I'm not ready to settle yet, and rejecting the offer allows me to make another counteroffer in the next round.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would be a fair price considering the significant value this product brings to your operations."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Midpoint Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.

* **Avoiding Settling:** I don't want to settle for a price too far below the product's true value."
