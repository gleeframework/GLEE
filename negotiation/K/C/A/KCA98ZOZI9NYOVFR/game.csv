"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value and uniqueness of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $20000 on it. Would you consider lowering the price to $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I still feel that $18000 is too high for me. Could we perhaps aim for $16000? I believe this would be a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",16000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. I am still unable to justify spending $17500 on the product. Could we aim for $16500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",16500.0,Bob,6,
