"I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-value product. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $15,000, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",12000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you want to meet in the middle, but considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm raising the price to $13,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the fact that I'm still below the $15,000 mark.",13000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $11,500. That's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $14,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $14,000. I'll offer you the product for $13,500. This is my final compromise.",13500.0,Alice,5,,
