Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $14,000. I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $14,000. I'll offer you the product for $13,500. This is my final compromise.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500.  At this point, the potential savings of continuing the negotiation with Alice are outweighed by the risk of her increasing the price further or reaching an impasse. Buying from John for $15,000 guarantees you get the product and avoids potentially wasting time on a negotiation that might not yield a significantly better price."
