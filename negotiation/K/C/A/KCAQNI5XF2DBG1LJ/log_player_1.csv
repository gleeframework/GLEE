"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit lower than what I'd ideally like to get ($150), but still higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives him some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I need to make a reasonable profit.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about $100? I'm willing to split the difference a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to keep the price as low as possible. How about $85? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price of $150. I'm not willing to sell for less than that.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want a good price, but $85 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $95? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to both come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure we're going to meet in the middle again, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm sticking to my minimum of $150 for now, as I know I can get that from John if I need to.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $92 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $97, but that's my final offer.  If you're not willing to go higher, I'll have to consider selling to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 97}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $97, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $91? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $150. I've already made multiple counteroffers and I'm not willing to go any lower. I've had enough of this negotiation and I'm not confident I'll get a better deal from Bob in the next rounds. I'll sell to John, who is offering my minimum price."
