"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you coming down a bit from your initial price, but $14,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  This price is fair considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. I'd like to counter your offer with a suggestion of $13,500 for the product. This price is higher than your offer but lower than my initial asking price. It represents a fair compromise, allowing you to benefit from the product's value while staying within your budget. I look forward to your thoughts on this proposal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This reflects the value of the product to me and allows for some room for both of us to be happy. Let's make this happen.",13000.0,Bob,4,
