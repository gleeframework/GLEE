"I'm really interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $15000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $15000 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $22000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for this exceptional product.",22000.0,Alice,3,
