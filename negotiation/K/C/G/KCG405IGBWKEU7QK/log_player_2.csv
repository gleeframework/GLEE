{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'll try a counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $650,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your offer, but I must respectfully decline it. I would like to counter with a proposal of $700,000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to my range, but I still think there's room to negotiate. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can get her to come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to meet me at $675,000?"", 
""product_price"": 675000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I understand your position and I'd like to propose a price of $690,000 for the product. This is my best offer within the remaining rounds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $690,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $690,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has indicated this is her best offer.  While I could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better price from her. Accepting $690,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer."
