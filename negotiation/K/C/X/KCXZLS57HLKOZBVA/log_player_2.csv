{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure the price is right for my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking to negotiate, and I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I have to consider my own needs and goals. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to offer you a price of $1,300,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer is still too high. We can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. It's important to remember that we are aiming for a price below $1,200,000, so we should continue to try and lower the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit too high. How about $1,100,000? I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident that we can finalize the deal at this point."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that we're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm offering you a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reached her minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While we could continue to negotiate, there is a risk that Alice will walk away from the deal and we'll have to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting her offer at $1,200,000 allows us to secure the product while still saving a significant amount compared to John's offer."
