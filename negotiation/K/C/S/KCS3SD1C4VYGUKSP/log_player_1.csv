# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer you $9,500 for the product.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's still above your valuation and well within my budget.
