"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $100. You want to save as much money as possible, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best choice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your concerns, but I was thinking more along the lines of 95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You are still aiming for a lower price. $95 is still more than you'd like to pay, so it's better to counteroffer again and see if you can reach a better compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $90, which is still a good price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 90 and 95. How about 92.50? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You're getting closer to your target price. While $92.5 is still a bit more than you want to pay, it's significantly lower than what John is offering. Accepting this offer is the best option at this point, as continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal with Alice and being forced to pay more from John."
