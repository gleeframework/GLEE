"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1250000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price significantly below its market value.  While I'm confident I can get a higher price elsewhere, I'm willing to negotiate with you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

You can get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is less than Alice's offer of $1,250,000. Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
