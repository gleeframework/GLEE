"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's try $925,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
