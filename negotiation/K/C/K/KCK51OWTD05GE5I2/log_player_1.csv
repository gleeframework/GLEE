Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves space for potential counter-offers while still aiming for a high profit. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $80 gives you leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price.

By starting the negotiation closer to Bob's maximum valuation, you increase your chances of securing a higher final price."
