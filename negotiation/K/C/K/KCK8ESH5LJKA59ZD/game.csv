"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $700,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $825,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would that price point be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, though. I'll offer it to you for $800,000. This is already a discount from the original price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.",800000.0,Alice,5,
