Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $700,000 to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still looking for a better price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $825,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, though. I'll offer it to you for $800,000. This is already a discount from the original price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. I'm open to further negotiations, but I need to be realistic about the product's value.

Alice has come down to her product's value.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and this is already a significant savings."
