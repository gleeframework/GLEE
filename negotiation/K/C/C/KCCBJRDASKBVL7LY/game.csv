"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $80. Would you be willing to go down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95, which still gives you a good price while ensuring I can cover my costs. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? That would be a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $92.50. That's a good compromise, and it gives us both a fair deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm still trying to get closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle again at $91? I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us.",91.0,Bob,6,
