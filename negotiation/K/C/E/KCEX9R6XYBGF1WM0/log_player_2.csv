Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $7,000, but I'm still a bit far from breaking even. I can offer you a slight discount to $7,200. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,200

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower and we're getting a decent discount. It's not worth risking having to buy it for $8,000 from John."
