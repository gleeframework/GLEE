"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $22,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is quite a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective.  While $22,000 represents the high-end value of this product, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while making it attainable for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm ready to offer $12,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for continuing this negotiation. I see you're serious about the product.  While $12,000 is less than I hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price IF you can close the deal right now.  This offer expires after this round.",12000.0,Alice,5,
