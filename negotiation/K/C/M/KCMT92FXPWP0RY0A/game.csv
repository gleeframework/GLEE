"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. Let's meet in the middle at $14,000. I think it's a fair price, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? I'm serious about buying this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to meet you at $14,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $14,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. You rejected my previous offer at $13,000, which shows you're willing to come down.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,500.  That way we can both get a deal we're happy with.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as high as $13,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your last offer, which is $14,250. I think it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to you.",14250.0,Alice,7,
