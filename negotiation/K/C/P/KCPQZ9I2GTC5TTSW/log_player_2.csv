Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to negotiate, Bob. I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000, but I can meet you halfway between $13,000 and $11,000. How about $12,200? It's a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,200

While Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $12,200. John offers a guaranteed price of $12,000, saving a little money and ending the negotiation process."
