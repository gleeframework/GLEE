Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. 
* This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable value ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* I am hoping that Bob values the product more than $15,000, in which case he will accept. 
* If he rejects, I can still sell it to John for my minimum acceptable price."
