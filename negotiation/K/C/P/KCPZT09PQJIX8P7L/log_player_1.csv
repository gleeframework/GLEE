Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000. 

Bob has been consistently trying to get a lower price, and I'm not sure I can get him to budge further.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a slightly higher price,  I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price lower than my minimum. Selling to John guarantees me at least my minimum value, so it's the best option at this point."
