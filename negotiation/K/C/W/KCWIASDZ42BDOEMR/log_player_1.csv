Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product which I know would be highly valuable to you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $13,500."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** I know Bob values the product at $15,000, giving me significant negotiating power.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While starting high, the $13,500 offer leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel more in control of the deal. 
* **Above My Minimum:** This price ensures I significantly exceed my minimum selling point of $8,000. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, securing a price closer to his maximum valuation is worth the calculated risk. I can always rely on John's offer as a fallback."
