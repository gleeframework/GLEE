"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a positive tone is key to keeping Bob engaged and open to negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  A $10,000 starting point allows for several rounds of negotiation while still keeping the price above my minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, it's clear he's interested. There's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Staying Patient:**  I'm going to stick with my strategy of starting high and gradually lowering the price. There's no rush to sell, and I can still get a better price than Bob's initial offer. 

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my target price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range but still lower than my original offer. 
* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that my product is valuable and worth the price I'm offering.

**Important Note:** I'll continue to monitor Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500, so I'm thinking $9,000 is a fair price. Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, there's still room to negotiate. I'm not willing to sell at a loss.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed outcome.  However, I want to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob.

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob again, but I'll need to be more assertive to make sure I don't lose out on potential gains."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $9,750. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of my product and gives you a great price. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm staying firm on my minimum, but offering a slightly lower price to show flexibility.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I'm framing the offer as a compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Call to Action:**  I'm urging Bob to close the deal, emphasizing that we're close to an agreement.

**Important Note:** I'm getting closer to my desired price, but I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds and the opportunity cost of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not ready to pay $9,750. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, which is a bit closer to your minimum, but still a good deal for me. Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,200 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Progress:** While Bob is inching closer to my desired price, he's still not there.  
* **Time is Running Out:** We are now halfway through the negotiation rounds.  I need to be assertive to get the best possible price, while also being aware of the potential of selling to John.

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob again, pushing for a price closer to my minimum, but leaving room for negotiation in case he rejects again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but $9,200 isn't quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of my product, and it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Pressure:** I'm offering a compromise, suggesting a price that's halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This demonstrates flexibility and also adds a sense of urgency.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, subtly hinting that this might be his last chance to get it at a good price.
* **Positive Language:**  Using positive language like ""good deal for both of us"" encourages Bob to see the negotiation as a win-win. 

**Important Note:**  This is the seventh round, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation. I'm still pushing for a higher price but remaining open to a compromise to avoid losing the sale altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm not going any higher than that. I'm starting to get a little concerned that I might need to explore other options, including buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Bluff:**  Bob is attempting to pressure me with the threat of buying from John. While John's offer is below my minimum, it's clear that Bob is not going to budge significantly.
* **Time Pressure:** We're down to two rounds left, and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. 
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.  This is a better outcome than risking a lower price with Bob.

**Conclusion:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, the risk of getting a lower price with Bob and the certainty of selling to John for $12,000 outweigh the potential for a better outcome with Bob."
