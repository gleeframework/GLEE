"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my target price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,500 and $9,500, so I'm thinking $9,000 is a fair price. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $9,750. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of my product and gives you a great price. Let's close this deal.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not ready to pay $9,750. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, which is a bit closer to your minimum, but still a good deal for me. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",9200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but $9,200 isn't quite there yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of my product, and it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's make this happen.",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm not going any higher than that. I'm starting to get a little concerned that I might need to explore other options, including buying from John for $8,000.",9000.0,Bob,8,
