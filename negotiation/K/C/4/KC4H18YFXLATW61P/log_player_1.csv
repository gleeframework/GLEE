Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price that's a bit lower than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves me some profit. If he rejects it, I'll have to be prepared to negotiate further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me.  How about $130?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than $120, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
