"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's in great condition and worth a lot to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $140. This means there's room for negotiation. You're willing to pay up to $150, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is a good strategy to try and save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me.  How about $130?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $130 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $135, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $135, which is still a good deal for you as it's below your maximum price of $150. Accepting her offer means you'll save $15 compared to buying from John."
