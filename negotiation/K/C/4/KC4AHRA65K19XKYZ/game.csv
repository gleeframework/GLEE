,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we try $1,250,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
