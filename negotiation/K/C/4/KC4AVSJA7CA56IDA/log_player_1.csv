Round 2

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $60 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price and still have rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $75. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 75}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $67? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $67. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $67
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $67 is closer to my goal, I believe I can still get a better price, especially since I have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're getting closer to my desired price.  I'm willing to go down to $70. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 70}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $68.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $68.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $68.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $68.50 is a better price than Bob's previous offers, it's still below my minimum goal of $80.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm concerned that we won't reach a satisfactory agreement.  Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $80 to ensure I get the minimum price I'm comfortable with."
