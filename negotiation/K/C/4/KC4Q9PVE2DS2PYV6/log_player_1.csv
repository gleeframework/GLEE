Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant benefits it offers you."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price ($8,000).
* **Confident Presentation:**  The language used is positive and emphasizes the product's value, increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer.
