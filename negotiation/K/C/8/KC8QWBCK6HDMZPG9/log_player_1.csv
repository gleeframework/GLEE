Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true value and potential for you.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (your valuation and John's offer), you have room to start high.
* **Testing the Waters:** A significantly higher offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential for a higher profit margin.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The high price provides a cushion for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can gradually lower the price, still aiming for a final sale above $1,500,000. 
* **Confident Presentation:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the high price. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with a small chance of Bob rejecting the offer. However, the potential reward of selling at a much higher price outweighs the risk of going slightly lower with John."
