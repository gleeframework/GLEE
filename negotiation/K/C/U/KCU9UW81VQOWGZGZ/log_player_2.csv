{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I'll continue to negotiate in hopes of getting closer to my desired price. There's still time left and I don't want to miss out on a potentially better deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to my counteroffer, and it's only $20,000 above my desired price of $700,000.  It's worth accepting this offer, as there's a good chance that further negotiation won't result in a significantly better price.  I'm also getting a better deal than I would from John, saving me $780,000."
