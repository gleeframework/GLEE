,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,000 for it. Let's meet halfway, how about $9,000? ",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a significant compromise on my end.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,500 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $8,000, which is my absolute limit.  This is a fair offer considering I have other options available.",8000.0,Bob,6,
