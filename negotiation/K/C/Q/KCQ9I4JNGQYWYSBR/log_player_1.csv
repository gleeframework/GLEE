"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I am not willing to sell the product for that amount.  I will counter-offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,000 for it. Let's meet halfway, how about $9,000? "", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 
 
I'm trying to find a middle ground that is still profitable for me, but also keeps the deal on track.  $9,000 seems like a fair compromise considering Bob's offer and my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $7,500? That's a significant compromise on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counter-offer again to try and find a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,500 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum threshold.  I believe $8,500 is a reasonable compromise and a fair deal for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but I'm on a tight budget. I can do $8,000, which is my absolute limit.  This is a fair offer considering I have other options available. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and I believe it's the best deal I can get at this point.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale to another buyer, and selling to John would mean losing a significant amount of money. Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice."
