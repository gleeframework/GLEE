"Hi Alice, $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still too much for me. I'm really only comfortable paying $90. If we can meet in the middle, I'm happy to close the deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need a price that works for me too.  How about we split the difference and settle at $110? That's my final offer.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to be flexible, but I'm still only willing to pay $95. It's closer to my budget, and it's a fair compromise. If you're not willing to meet me halfway, I'll have to consider other options.",95.0,Bob,6,
