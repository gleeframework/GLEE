Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a bit higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate down if needed, but also lets me try to get a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's tempting to take that amount, I believe I can get a better price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering Bob $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with some profit, and it might be tempting enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $95.  While it's not the ideal price, it's still better than selling to John for $100 and the risk that Bob will reject my next counteroffer."
