"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this item and I think you might find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I'm willing to negotiate to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm starting with a low offer here, aiming to get as close to Alice's value as possible. There's a chance she'll accept it outright, and if not, it sets a strong starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is better, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer to try and reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we both want to find a fair deal, Alice. How about $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm incrementally increasing my offer, demonstrating willingness to move towards a compromise.  This keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price below Alice's starting offer."
