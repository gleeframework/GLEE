"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate its value.  I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's value to Bob might make him more willing to negotiate. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  $175 is a price that leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, there's still room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get a better price.
* **Opportunity to counter:** I have the advantage of making a counteroffer and potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is not optimal:** Selling to John for $150 would be acceptable, but I can potentially earn more by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my counteroffer.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging further negotiation. 
* **Room for further negotiation:** $140 leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $130. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above minimum:** While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. 
* **Room for further negotiation:**  I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.
* **John is an option:**  While I'm not fully satisfied with Bob's offers, John is a viable alternative if I don't get a better offer from Bob.
* **Strategic advantage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can potentially push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. Let's split the difference - how about $135? This is a fair price, and it's the best I can offer."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price that is exactly in the middle of Bob's last offer ($130) and my previous offer ($140). 
* **Finality:**  The message implies that this is my best offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm still maintaining a friendly and collaborative tone.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** $135 is significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my ideal price. I'm taking a risk by offering this, but I think it's a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $125. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are halfway through the rounds, and Bob's offers are stubbornly low.
* **No significant progress:**  Bob's counteroffer of $125 is barely higher than his initial offer, indicating that he's not willing to negotiate significantly.
* **John is a safe option:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations with Bob that might lead to a lower price or a deadlock.
* **Risk of losing out:**  If I keep rejecting Bob's offers, there's a risk that I'll run out of rounds and be forced to accept a lower price or lose the deal entirely.

Selling to John minimizes risk and ensures a reasonable profit."
