Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more to you than it is to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're not giving away the product for less than you're willing to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** $12,000 is still significantly less than the product is worth to Bob, so he has incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It shows you're confident in the value of your product and willing to be firm.

Remember, your goal is to maximize your profit. You can adjust your offers based on Bob's responses, and you always have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiations don't go your way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than $8,000, it's still far below the product's worth to Bob. You're in a good position to continue negotiating.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, you're signaling that you're willing to negotiate, but also that you won't settle for a significantly lower price.
* **Splitting the difference:** Offering $11,000 shows you're willing to compromise while still getting closer to your desired price.
* **Positive framing:**  The message focuses on the benefits for Bob, highlighting the ""great deal"" he's still getting."
