Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,050,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take his $1,050,000, I believe I can get a better price. I'm still confident I can get closer to my target of $1,150,000."
