"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you is $15,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is my best counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. This is my final offer.",11750.0,Alice,5,
