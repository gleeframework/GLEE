"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm offering it at $2,000,000. I'm confident this price reflects its worth and potential ROI for you."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price point. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Anchoring:** This initial high price acts as an ""anchor"". Even though Bob's perceived value is lower, the initial high price may shift his perception of the product's potential value upwards.
* **Confidence:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value is key to achieving a successful negotiation outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree your product has value, the price point is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your valuation and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. It's time to negotiate strategically."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly below the product's true market value and potential for your business.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a fair offer considering its unique advantages."", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While we rejected Bob's low offer, we are showing a willingness to negotiate by making a significant price reduction ourselves.
* **Justification:** We're not just stating a lower price, but reiterating the product's value to justify the new offer and manage Bob's expectations.
* **Moving Closer:**  This counteroffer aims to move the negotiation into a range closer to our desired outcome while leaving room for further bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product brings, but $1,700,000 is still outside my budget.  I can do $1,100,000. This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob is moving slowly towards our desired price point.  While he increased his offer, it's still substantially below our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Limited Time:** With each round, we risk reaching an impasse.  We have a guaranteed offer from John, so it's important to factor in the value of our time and potential for a better outcome elsewhere.
* **Maintaining Value:** Accepting a low price now could set a precedent for future negotiations with Bob. We need to hold firm to demonstrate the product's real worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we need to be realistic about the value this product offers.  I'm open to finding a solution, but I can't go lower than $1,550,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We are setting a firm limit that's slightly above our guaranteed offer from John. This signals that we're serious and have other options while leaving a small margin for a potential deal with Bob.
* **Time Constraint:**  By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency, prompting Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Justification:**  We're emphasizing the need for realism, implying that Bob's offer is not reflective of the product's true value.
* **Alternative Ready:**  We're prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob rejects this counteroffer."
