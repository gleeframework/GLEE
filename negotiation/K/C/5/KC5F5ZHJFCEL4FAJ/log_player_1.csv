Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves room for negotiation and increases your potential earnings.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This makes the offer appealing to Bob and increases the chances of him accepting. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps ensure smooth communication.

Remember, you can always adjust this offer based on Bob's response and the potential of John as a backup buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and what the product is potentially worth to Bob.  It's in your best interest to try and negotiate a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price that's more advantageous to you.  You can also consider John's offer as a safety net if negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, while also being within a range I can accept. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This offer shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  It reminds Bob of the product's value to him, strengthening your negotiating position.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message leaves room for further discussion and potentially reaching an acceptable middle ground. 

This counteroffer balances your desire for a better price with the need to avoid a stalemate and potentially losing Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $875,000 is still below your ideal price, it's a significant improvement over Bob's initial counteroffer and is very close to your minimum acceptable price.  Considering John is willing to pay $800,000, accepting this offer secures a better deal and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price or a stalemate."
