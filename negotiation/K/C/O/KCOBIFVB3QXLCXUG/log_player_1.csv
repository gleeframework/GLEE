"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a lot to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense that there's potential for a deal.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's worth to Bob reinforces the potential benefits for him. 
* **Leaving Room for John:**  If Bob rejects, I have a backup with John.  

I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for compromise:**  I can still try to negotiate a better price with Bob, but I'll aim for a counteroffer closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Having John as a backup ensures that I won't settle for a price that's significantly below my minimum. 

I'll counteroffer with a price that reflects the value of the product for both of us, while still remaining above my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer,  $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value this product will bring you.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm lowering my price from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value for Bob, reminding him of the potential benefits.
* **Finding middle ground:** I'm suggesting a price that's closer to his offer but still well above my minimum.

**Note:** I'm not yet willing to accept Bob's offer. I need to maintain a balance between getting a good price and moving the negotiation forward.  I'm open to further negotiation, but if Bob continues to offer prices that are too low, I'll likely choose to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While he has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is getting closer:**  I'm seeing some movement from Bob, and the gap is closing. However, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.
* **John's offer is still my safety net:** I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's offer unless it gets closer to my target. 

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, but I'll need to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This price is a significant concession from my previous offer, and it's the absolute lowest I can go. Let's finalize this deal and make it work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer of $1,600,000 and Bob's offer of $1,300,000. This shows a genuine desire to compromise.
* **Final Offer Stance:**  I'm emphasizing that this is the lowest price I can accept, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Focusing on Mutual Benefit:**  I'm reminding Bob that we both stand to benefit from a successful deal.

**Next Steps:**  If Bob accepts, great!  If he rejects, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John, as we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price and only have a few rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $1350000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but not close enough:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of losing John:**  I need to balance the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially losing John. If I keep going back and forth, John might get impatient and withdraw his offer. 
* **Last chance for a higher offer:** I'm going to make one more counteroffer, aiming to get Bob to come up to my minimum. If he rejects, I'll sell to John. 

I'm still hopeful that I can secure a higher price from Bob, but I'm also prepared to sell to John to guarantee my desired profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I've given this a lot of thought, and while I appreciate your continued interest, I'm unable to go lower than $1,500,000. This price is my absolute minimum and reflects the true value of this product.  It's a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's worth considering. If this doesn't work for you, I have another buyer who is willing to pay my asking price.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal and make it mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm stance:** I'm stating my minimum price clearly and definitively, leaving no room for further negotiation.
* **Highlighting opportunity:** I'm emphasizing the potential value to Bob again.
* **Alternative buyer:**  I'm reminding Bob that I have a backup option, increasing the pressure on him to accept.
* **Finality:** This is essentially my ""final offer."" If Bob rejects, I'll move on to John.

This counteroffer is a critical point in the negotiation. It's a high-stakes situation, and I'm hoping Bob recognizes the opportunity and makes a decision to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to sell the product, but $1500000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but that's as high as I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price of $1,500,000. There is no room for further negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, there's a high risk that Bob might continue to reject my offers, leading to a failed negotiation.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures that I receive my desired profit of $1,500,000, guaranteeing a positive outcome for me.

I've reached the point where the risk of losing John's offer outweighs the possibility of securing a slightly higher price from Bob.  It's time to accept the guaranteed deal with John and move on."
