"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1750000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a lot to you. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer,  $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value this product will bring you.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000. Can you meet me at that price?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1300000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1450000. This price is a significant concession from my previous offer, and it's the absolute lowest I can go. Let's finalize this deal and make it work for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to go up to $1350000. Can you consider that?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've given this a lot of thought, and while I appreciate your continued interest, I'm unable to go lower than $1500000. This price is my absolute minimum and reflects the true value of this product.  It's a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's worth considering. If this doesn't work for you, I have another buyer who is willing to pay my asking price.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal and make it mutually beneficial.",1500000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're trying to sell the product, but $1500000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1300000, but that's as high as I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
