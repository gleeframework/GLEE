Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation but still below your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $100 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $150. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $115? It's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make some profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. I am willing to pay $110 for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $110 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and better than selling to John for $150.  It's a good compromise and allows me to move forward with the sale."
