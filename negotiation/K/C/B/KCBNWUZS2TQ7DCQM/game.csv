"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it offers.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we try $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,000,000 is still too low for me. How about we settle at $1,250,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me. That price is getting closer, but I'm aiming to stay under $1,200,000.  Would you consider $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, you're really getting close.  I can see you're serious about this purchase. How about we split the difference and make it $1,187,500?  That's my final offer.",1187500.0,Alice,7,
