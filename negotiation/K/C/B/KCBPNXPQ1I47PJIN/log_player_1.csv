Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its incredible potential, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Even though Bob's offer is strong, it's still significantly below his perceived value. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to give away such a large chunk of the potential profit so early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,275,000? I believe that's a fair compromise."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,275,000 is still a bit above my target. I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is moving too slowly for my liking. His offer is getting closer to a point where I might accept it, but I need to apply more pressure.  I'll make a counteroffer that's only slightly better to see if he's getting nervous."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I need you to be serious about this. The value of this product is undeniable, and I have other interested parties.  I can come down to $1,220,000, but that's my absolute best offer."",
""product_price"": 1220000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd be willing to pay $1,180,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I believe the product is worth more, Bob is clearly anchored around the $1,200,000 mark. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of him walking away and secures a healthy profit."
