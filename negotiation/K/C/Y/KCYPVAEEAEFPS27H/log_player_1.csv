{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 would be fair and beneficial for both of us.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible while still ensuring a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit higher ($1,150,000) allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Alice has a strong alternative buyer (John) willing to pay her full value, giving her leverage in the negotiation with Bob. 

By offering the product at $1,150,000, Alice aims to secure a significant profit while leaving a small margin for potential negotiation with Bob."
