{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'd accept ($8,000), but still within a range that Bob might find appealing.  I'm leaving room for negotiation while also trying to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm going to try to push for a higher offer from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,250?  I'm confident you'll still be happy with this price, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking to make a fair profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $7,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a bit more, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. It's better to secure a sale at $7,800 than to risk getting nothing if I continue negotiating."
