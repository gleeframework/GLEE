"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I can meet you in the middle at $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still a ways off from that price point. Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product. I can see that you're willing to pay a premium for it. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000 again, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a free maintenance package. Can we call it a day at $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer and the added incentives. However, $825,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  My best offer is $775,000. This considers the value I place on the product and the added benefits you are offering.",775000.0,Bob,6,
