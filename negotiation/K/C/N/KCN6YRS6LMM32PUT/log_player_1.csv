{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($12,000), but I'm leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by suggesting the product is perfect for him. This should encourage him to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the suggestion, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $9000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that's so far below my desired amount. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is my minimum price. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. Considering my budget, I can agree to purchase the product at $11000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price of $12,000. While I would prefer to get closer to that, continuing to negotiate might risk losing him as a buyer. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and guarantees me $11,000, which is still a good amount."
