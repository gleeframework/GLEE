Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth $120 to someone like you.  To make it an easy decision, I'm willing to let it go for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($120) maximizes potential profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $115 leaves some room for Bob to feel like he's getting a deal while staying above your minimum price ($100).
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John provides a safety net, allowing you to be slightly bolder with your initial offer to Bob."
