"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This offer starts at $1,150,000. It's a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You need to earn at least $1,000,000, so this is a safe starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It demonstrates confidence:** You're not starting at the lowest possible price, showing that you believe your product is valuable. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground quickly and hopefully close the deal before the 10 rounds are up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,100,000 is still a good deal, it's important to remember:

* **You have room to negotiate:** You're still $100,000 above your minimum, and Bob values the product higher than that.
* **Time is on your side:** You have 8 rounds left, so you can try to squeeze a bit more out of the deal.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If things fall apart, you have a guaranteed $1,000,000.

By rejecting the offer, you're showing Bob that you're willing to hold out for a better price. This will make him more likely to counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Signal of willingness to deal:** It shows Bob that you're willing to compromise but still want to secure a good price.
* **Avoid the extremes:**  Going too low too quickly could make you seem desperate.  

By offering $1,125,000, you're giving Bob a chance to meet you halfway.  This should encourage further negotiation while keeping the deal moving towards a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to your minimum, there are still a few reasons to reject this offer:

* **Room for improvement:**  He's still $25,000 below your previous offer, indicating there's still potential to negotiate.
* **Time is still on your side:** You have 6 rounds remaining, giving you leverage.
* **John's offer remains a secure backup:**  If you fail to reach a satisfactory agreement, you can always sell to John.

By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're still willing to negotiate and try to push for a higher price. This can potentially lead to a more advantageous final deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is exactly halfway between your last offer and Bob's latest counteroffer. It shows you're willing to compromise but still value your product.
* **Maintain momentum:** Keeping the negotiation moving is important, especially with the time limit. This offer demonstrates a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Testing the waters:** This offer allows you to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. If he rejects it, it might indicate he's not serious about buying at a reasonable price. 

This counteroffer is designed to be a fair and enticing proposition for Bob while ensuring you maintain a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the minimum:** While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you're still $50,000 away from your ideal price.
* **Time is running out:**  You only have 4 rounds left, so you need to be strategic.
* **John's offer is safe:** You can always sell to John for $1,000,000 if needed. 

This is a tricky situation. While accepting the offer would secure a profit, you might be able to get closer to your goal price with a final counteroffer. The risk is that Bob might reject your counteroffer, leaving you with only John's option.  

By rejecting this offer, you are essentially betting that you can convince Bob to go slightly higher in the final rounds."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This is a crucial round. Time is running out, and you need to be strategic.

* **Almost there:** This offer is only $25,000 below your previous offer. This shows Bob you are serious about reaching an agreement but still value your product.
* **Last chance:**  This might be your last chance to get a price closer to your target.
* **Calculating the risk:**  If Bob rejects this, you have only 3 rounds left. Selling to John is a real possibility, but it would be a lower price than you are hoping for.

This offer is a calculated risk. It's a strong closing offer, but you need to be prepared for Bob to potentially reject it. You are essentially making a gamble that Bob is more interested in closing the deal than saving the last $25,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the risk of pushing for a higher price is too high. Here's why:

* **Low margin:** Bob's offer is only $25,000 above John's offer. This is a very small margin, and any further negotiation could easily result in a worse outcome.
* **Time is almost up:**  Only two rounds remain. There's a good chance Bob will reject your next offer, leaving you with no time to make another.
* **John is a sure thing:**  Selling to John guarantees you a minimum profit. It's a safe and reliable option. 

At this point, the potential for a better deal is outweighed by the risk of losing out on even the minimum profit. Selling to John ensures you get a decent price and minimizes the risk of ending the negotiation empty-handed."
