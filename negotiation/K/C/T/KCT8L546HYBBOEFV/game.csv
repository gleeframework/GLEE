"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find highly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment for someone like yourself.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that initial price is a little high for me.  I would be willing to offer $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 falls significantly short of what I consider a fair price for this product and its potential value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
