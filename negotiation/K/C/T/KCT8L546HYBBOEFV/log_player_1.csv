"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find highly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment for someone like yourself."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We begin with a strong opening offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer provides space for negotiation and counteroffers, allowing us to gauge Bob's interest and potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Confident Tone:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, subtly anchoring Bob's perception around a higher price point.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and flexibility, setting the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that initial price is a little high for me.  I would be willing to offer $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value ($1,500,000). Accepting would mean a substantial loss compared to selling to John. By rejecting, we signal that his offer is unacceptable and create an opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 falls significantly short of what I consider a fair price for this product and its potential value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Lowball:** We firmly counter Bob's low offer, signaling that we're serious about getting a fair price.
* **Strategic Concession:** We show flexibility by decreasing our price by $100,000, but not too much, demonstrating we're willing to negotiate but not desperate.
* **Justification:** We reiterate the product's value to justify the higher price and encourage Bob to meet us closer to our range. 

This counteroffer aims to bring Bob back to the negotiating table with a more reasonable offer while keeping us in a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 now matches your minimum acceptable price and equals what John is offering. While there might be a slight chance of getting a bit more from Bob, it's a relatively small risk compared to the possibility of him lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling. Accepting now secures a solid profit and avoids potentially missing out on both buyers."
