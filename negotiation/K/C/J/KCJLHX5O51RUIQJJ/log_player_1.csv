"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, at $11,000.  This is above Bob's perceived value, but I want to see if I can get close to my desired price. I'm confident in the product's worth and am willing to negotiate, but I don't want to undervalue it right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, as I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering $9,500 to Bob.  This is still above his initial offer, but closer to my desired price point and his perceived value.  This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe the product is worth more than $8,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my minimum target price of $10,000.  I'm confident that I can get a better offer from Bob with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm offering $9,250 to Bob. This is a small compromise from my last offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my target."
