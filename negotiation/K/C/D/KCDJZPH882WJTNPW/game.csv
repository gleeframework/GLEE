"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. How about $150?",150.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I think the product is worth more than $150. How about we meet in the middle at $175? I'm willing to give you a good deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for it.",175.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $160. How about we compromise at $170? I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent price for the product.",170.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not willing to go as low as $165, Bob. I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. How about we compromise at $168? It's the best I can do.",168.0,Alice,7,
