"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This price still allows you to get a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",950000.0,Alice,3,
