Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to begin negotiations with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair reflection of its worth,"" the message subtly justifies the higher price without being overly aggressive. 
* **Gauge Interest:** This first offer serves to gauge Bob's interest level and willingness to negotiate. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything because you have John as a backup buyer."
