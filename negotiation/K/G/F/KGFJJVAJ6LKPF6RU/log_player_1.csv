Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value and potential enjoyment for Bob to increase his willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By not starting at my minimum of $120, I allow for the possibility of a back-and-forth negotiation. 
* **The John Factor:** I have a safety net with John, so I'm not overly pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I'm confident I can get a better price through negotiation.
* **The John Factor:**  While $120 from John is tempting, I have time to negotiate with Bob and potentially get closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $100 to $95. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reiterating the value of the product for Bob.
* **Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as beneficial for both of us. 
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not sacrificing my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure I can go up to $95. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, so it's a reasonable offer.
* **Time Factor:** I've already spent time negotiating with Bob, and it's possible he won't budge further.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  While $120 from John is tempting, there's no guarantee that he'll still be interested if I reject Bob's offer.
* **Potential for Future Sales:** If I can secure a sale with Bob, there's a chance he might be interested in purchasing from me again in the future."
