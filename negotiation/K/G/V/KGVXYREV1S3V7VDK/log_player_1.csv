Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He'd ideally want to pay less, but going too low might make him lose the deal.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999 represent potential deals where both you and Bob benefit.

**The Offer Strategy**

We want to start with a strong offer within the ZOPA that leans towards your favor. This achieves two things:

1. **Maximizes Potential Profit:**  You could get lucky and Bob might accept a price closer to your minimum.
2. **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have space to come down while still staying above your guaranteed price.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects its worth and presents a sound investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The price is significantly above Bob's perceived value, giving you leverage.
* **Professional Tone:** The message is polite and emphasizes the product's value, framing it positively for Bob.
* **Open for Counter-Offer:** While firm, the message doesn't sound like an ultimatum, allowing Bob to propose a counter-offer if needed. 

**Important Notes**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob is likely to counter-offer. Have a strategy for how low you're willing to go before accepting or walking away to John's deal.
* **Consider Alternatives:** Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to close with Bob, you could consider a slightly lower initial offer."
