"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that I think we can both be happy with.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would be a good price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, which is still a discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price for the product's value.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you getting closer to my price. Let's try $10,750. This is a fair compromise that's closer to both of our target prices.  I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,750. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, which is still a discount from my initial offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm sure we can agree on it.  If not, I might need to consider other options.",11000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,250, but I want to make it clear that this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Alice,9,
