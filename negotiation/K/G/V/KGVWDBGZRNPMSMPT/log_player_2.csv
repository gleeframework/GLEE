"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt a counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking to pay less, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's try to bridge the gap and reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,350,000, which is a significant drop from her initial offer and a good deal for Bob.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers, and the price could increase again.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $150,000 compared to buying from John and is a good compromise."
