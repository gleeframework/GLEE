"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is still a good price for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to pay less, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's try to bridge the gap and reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
