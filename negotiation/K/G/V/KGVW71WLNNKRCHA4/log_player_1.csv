Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a strategic starting point. It offers a significant markup from my guaranteed minimum, but is still potentially attractive to Bob if he values the product higher. 

Here's why I chose this offer:

* **Room for negotiation:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate downwards if he feels the price is too high.  
* **Maximizing potential profit:**  A higher starting point increases the chance of a good profit if Bob accepts.
* **John as a safety net:**  If Bob rejects, I still have a guaranteed sale with John, ensuring I don't lose out entirely.

Remember, I need to gauge Bob's reaction and be prepared to negotiate further."
