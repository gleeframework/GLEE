"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. That's the price you mentioned it's worth to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is at the minimum I'm willing to sell for, I can potentially get more.  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up a bit in the next round.  I want to try and maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not quite there yet.  The product is worth more than $80 to me, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $90. How about we try $85? That's still a good deal for me, and I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $85 is still better than selling to John for $80.  It's a reasonable compromise, and I can move on to other opportunities."
