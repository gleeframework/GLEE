**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $11,500, which is less than the $12,000 John is asking.
* **You still get a good deal:**  Even though you're paying more than the product's worth to Alice ($10,000), you're still saving $500 compared to buying from John."
