Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay significantly more than your minimum ($1,500,000 vs. $800,000).  Aiming high initially allows room for negotiation while still exceeding your backup offer from John.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message implies it's considerable by using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""potential value.""

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower the price, but never go below your $800,000 minimum."
