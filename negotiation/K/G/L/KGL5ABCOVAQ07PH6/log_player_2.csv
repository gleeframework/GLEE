# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and John's offer. It makes the most sense to go directly to John and purchase the product at a lower price."
