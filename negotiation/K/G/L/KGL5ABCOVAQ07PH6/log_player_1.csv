Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase [Product Name]. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts and if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""unique opportunity"" and ""immense value"" aims to create a perception of high demand and exclusivity, justifying the price premium.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, the language keeps the door open for negotiation. Bob can counter-offer, allowing you to gauge his interest and potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Before sending the offer, try to understand Bob's potential motivations and constraints. Does he need the product urgently? Are there alternatives in the market?
* **Negotiation Skills:**  Be prepared to negotiate effectively. Listen to Bob's concerns and be willing to compromise (within reason) to secure a deal."
