"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a valuable asset with significant potential for your business.  Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Rationale:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation. 

This initial offer aims to gauge Bob's interest while setting a firm position for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I value the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value.**  While he acknowledges the product's value, his offer is far too low.  
* **I still have 9 rounds left.** There's ample opportunity to negotiate further, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Selling to John is an option, but it's not ideal.**  I'd prefer to close the deal with Bob if possible, as it may lead to a higher price.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $600,000 is far below its true value.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the product's potential and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Counteroffer within a Reasonable Range:** My counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on Value and Mutual Benefit:** I'm re-emphasizing the value of the product and framing the deal as beneficial for both parties.
* **Direct Communication:** I'm stating my position clearly, avoiding ambiguity, and inviting Bob to engage in further discussion.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and move closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  This offer represents a fair deal for both of us, considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.** While his offer shows progress, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **There's still time to negotiate.** With 6 rounds remaining, I can continue to push for a more favorable price.
* **Selling to John is a backup option.** I'd prefer to exhaust all negotiation possibilities with Bob before resorting to selling to John.

I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable value, while keeping in mind the need to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $700,000 is simply not enough to cover my costs. To demonstrate my commitment to a mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000. This price acknowledges your budget while ensuring I can achieve my goals. Let's work together to finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Counteroffer with a Slight Decrease:** My counteroffer of $850,000 is a small reduction from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize the ""mutual benefit"" aspect, framing the deal as a win-win scenario.
* **Building Urgency:**  I'm suggesting we ""work together to finalize this agreement"", implying that I'm ready to close the deal if he's reasonable.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show Flexibility:** Indicate a willingness to compromise, making it clear I'm open to reaching an agreement.
* **Maintain a High Price:**  Still above my minimum acceptable value, I'm trying to extract as much value as possible.
* **Encourage a Deal:**  Adding a touch of urgency to nudge Bob towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further and offer you $750,000. This is a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.** While he's showing a willingness to negotiate, the offer is still too low.
* **Selling to John is a good alternative.** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory agreement with Bob increases.
* **A counteroffer might not be successful.**  Bob might not be willing to go much higher, and with limited rounds remaining, it's not clear if we can reach an agreement.

I'm choosing to reject Bob's offer and consider selling the product to John. While I'd prefer to work with Bob, the risk of a lower price is too high with the limited negotiation time remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. While $750,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value and your budget. Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Rationale:**

* **Counteroffer with a Significant Decrease:**  I'm decreasing my price significantly to $800,000, which is right at my minimum acceptable value. This shows a strong commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:**  I'm framing my offer as a ""significant compromise"" to highlight my willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Finalizing the Deal:**  I'm urging Bob to ""finalize this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to accept. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Push for a Decision:**  With only three rounds remaining, I'm pushing for a final decision from Bob.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  I'm minimizing the risk of ending up with a lower price by offering my minimum acceptable value.
* **Reaching a Compromise:**  I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still ensuring I achieve my minimum target price."
