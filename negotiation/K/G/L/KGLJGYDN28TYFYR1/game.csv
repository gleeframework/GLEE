"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay. I value the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $600,000 is far below its true value.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the product's potential and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  This offer represents a fair deal for both of us, considering the value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $700,000 is simply not enough to cover my costs. To demonstrate my commitment to a mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to lower my price to $850,000. This price acknowledges your budget while ensuring I can achieve my goals. Let's work together to finalize this agreement.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further and offer you $750,000. This is a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product.  Let me know if this works for you.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. While $750,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value and your budget. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",800000.0,Alice,7,
