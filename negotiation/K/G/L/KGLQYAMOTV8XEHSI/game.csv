"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'd like to get a better deal.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to meet you at $105, which is still a great deal for you, but also reflects the value I have in the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $105, which would be $100. Can you consider that?",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! However, I'm not willing to sell at $100, as I'd like to make a bit more profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but that's as high as I can go. Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",110.0,Alice,7,
