"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. To start the conversation, I'm offering it at $2,200,000."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation. This strategy aims to anchor the price in Bob's mind at a higher point. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer will help gauge Bob's level of interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will give me valuable information for subsequent rounds.
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware I have a guaranteed offer from John, which gives me a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2,200,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I have room to negotiate and will try to meet somewhere in the middle in the next round. I'm not willing to accept a loss by selling to Bob at this price when I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is appealing, the value of this product justifies a higher price point. I can come down to $1,850,000. This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer represents a significant decrease from my initial offer and lands closer to the middle ground between our initial positions. 
* **Justification:** By emphasizing the product's value, I aim to nudge Bob closer to my desired price range. 
* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate but also holds firm on a price point above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,850,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,500,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches my absolute minimum acceptable price. While I could try to push for a slightly higher amount in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that further negotiation could become protracted. Accepting this offer guarantees me a fair price and avoids the potential loss of time and effort involved in continued bargaining."
