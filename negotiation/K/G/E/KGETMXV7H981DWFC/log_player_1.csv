Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I think it's worth closer to $700,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $700,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is significantly below my valuation for this product. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can find a better middle ground. I'm willing to offer $750,000. This price still reflects the product's value, but it's more in line with my budget. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

``` 

We're still too far from my minimum price. Bob is slowly moving up, indicating potential for a better deal. It's worth continuing the negotiation for at least another round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $750,000 is closer to my bottom line, I still believe the product is worth more. How about we settle at $850,000? This price reflects the value and provides a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm not willing to go above $800,000. I've already compromised quite a bit, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $850,000, so I'll offer $825,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

This is a good deal for us. Bob has met us above our minimum acceptable price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
