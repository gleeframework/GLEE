""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value to you, I believe a price of $925,000 is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $800,000 (to John).
* **Negotiation Room:** This leaves a $200,000 potential profit margin.

By starting at $925,000, you're:

* **Aiming High:**  You're capturing a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Bob might try to haggle, and this starting point allows for some flexibility.
* **Above Your Minimum:** Even if Bob negotiates you down, you're still likely to get a better price than John's offer."
