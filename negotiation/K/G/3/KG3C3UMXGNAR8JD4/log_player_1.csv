Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing the price. Let me know if you're interested, and we can talk about it further."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$20,000 price:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. It gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob shows interest but isn't willing to pay the full amount. 
* **Open to discussion:** This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, which can make Bob more likely to engage.
* **Value proposition:**  While I don't know the product's value to Bob, I'm presenting it as a potential asset worth considering. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing my potential earnings while leaving room for negotiation and ensuring a successful sale."
