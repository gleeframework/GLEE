"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product that I believe you'll find valuable. I think it would be a steal for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $140 is less than your $150 maximum.
* **You save money:** Accepting Alice's offer saves you $10 compared to buying from John. 

While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, there's a risk she might refuse and you'd end up paying more through John."
