"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. Let me think about it... Ah, I can do $900,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've already given you a significant discount from my original price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $750,000. How about $825,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
