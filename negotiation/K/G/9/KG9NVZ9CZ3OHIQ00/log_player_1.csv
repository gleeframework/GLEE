"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate that Alice, but $160 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $130 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly above Bob's initial offer and allows me to avoid the risk of losing him as a buyer entirely."
