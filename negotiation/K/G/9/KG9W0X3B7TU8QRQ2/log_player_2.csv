"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $600,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly lower than the product's value to you ($600,000 vs. $800,000).  It's worth trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the product's value, $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's potential benefits to my business. I'm open to further discussion if you have any concerns."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to accept $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $725,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and is a fair deal for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $725,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly better than her initial offer of $600,000, and it's within your budget of $800,000. Accepting this offer saves you $75,000 compared to buying from John."
