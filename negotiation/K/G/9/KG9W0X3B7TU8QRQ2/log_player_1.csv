Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to start with an offer of $600,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the product's value, $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the product's potential benefits to my business. I'm open to further discussion if you have any concerns. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to accept $700,000.

I believe this price reflects the product's worth and is a fair deal for both parties."", ""product_price"": 725000}"
