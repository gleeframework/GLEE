"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,100,000. It's reasonable to believe she's willing to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but still within the range of what the product is worth to Bob.  It signals that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also determined to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now at $1,050,000.  While this is still above Bob's ideal price of $800,000, it's getting closer.  It's reasonable to assume that further negotiation will be more time-consuming and may not result in a significantly better price. Therefore, accepting the offer at $1,050,000 ensures Bob gets the product at a good price, while minimizing risk and saving time."
