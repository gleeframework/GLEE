"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high value and quality, I think it's worth more than what others might be willing to pay. Considering its true worth and your potential satisfaction, I am offering it to you for $100. This price reflects both the product's value and my desire to ensure you get a fair deal. I trust this offer will meet your expectations and allow us to make a transaction that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is framed to sound enticing, $100 is still more than your maximum budget of $80 and more than John's offer of $80. You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
