"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings at $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, knowing your upper limit is $1,000,000. While her offer is below your maximum, you can get a better deal from John for $1,000,000.  There's no need to rush into Alice's offer, even if she claims to have another buyer."
