"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation. It signals to Bob that the product is valuable, and it gives me room to move down if necessary. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price. I still have plenty of rounds left and a guaranteed backup buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,800.  This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible. I'm still confident I can get a better price, but I want to keep the negotiation moving forward and avoid getting stuck in a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for $9,500 or $9,600 in the next round. I'm still confident I can get a better deal, and I have the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,600. This is a compromise between my last offer and Bob's latest offer. It shows I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left and I'm not ready to settle for anything less than $9,500. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I'm confident I can get a better price, and I'm not afraid to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,500.  This is my final offer. I'm confident that Bob will accept this price, as it is only slightly above his last offer. If he rejects, I'm prepared to sell to John for $8,000 to ensure I don't lose out completely.  It's time to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm no longer confident I can get a better price from Bob. He's clearly unwilling to budge much further, and I only have two rounds left.  I'm going to sell to John for $8,000. This is the best way to ensure I get at least my minimum value and don't risk losing out completely."
