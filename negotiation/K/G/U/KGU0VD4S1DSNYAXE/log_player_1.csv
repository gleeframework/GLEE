"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but still within a range that might be acceptable to him.
* **Message:** I'm trying to build rapport by being friendly and expressing the value of the product. This helps set the stage for potential negotiation. 

I'm taking a risk by starting high, but I believe it's important to establish my bargaining position early on. I also want to see if Bob is even interested in negotiating at all.  If he rejects this offer, I'll have to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $100, I'm not willing to settle for less at this point.  I'll try to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price slightly from $110 to $95, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm reiterating that I'm trying to find a fair price for both of us. This helps to maintain a positive tone and shows that I'm taking his offer seriously.

My goal here is to find a middle ground. I believe $95 is still a good deal for me, considering I have a backup buyer at $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum price of $100, I'm still not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get a slightly better price by continuing the negotiation.  

* **I have the option to sell to John for $100.** This gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price from Bob. 
* **There are still 6 rounds left.**  This gives me ample time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. 

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to meet Bob halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92.50. This is a fair price that's closer to what you're looking for and still works for me. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm offering $92.50, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $90. 
* **Message:**  I'm reiterating my desire to find a fair price, using phrases like ""split the difference"" and ""make this happen"" to convey my eagerness to reach a deal.

By offering a compromise and highlighting the fairness of the price, I hope to encourage Bob to accept my offer.  If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate but will be more inclined to sell to John in the next round."
