Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $1,500,000 but am willing to negotiate. I'm also aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, considering your interest in the product.  This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options. "", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm aiming for a compromise that's closer to my minimum but still attractive to Bob.  I'm also trying to put a little pressure on him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I've reached my limit in terms of negotiation, and I'm not willing to drop below $1,500,000.  John is offering a much better price, and I'm going to sell the product to him."
