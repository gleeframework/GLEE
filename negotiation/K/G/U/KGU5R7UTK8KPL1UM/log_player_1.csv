"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get out of it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, but we need to incentivize him to move closer to our desired price range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, but I'm hoping we can do better than that. I believe the product's value to me is significantly lower than your asking price, so I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting closer to our fallback option of John's offer, but we still have room to negotiate. Bob explicitly stating he hopes to ""do better"" than his offer suggests he might be willing to go higher. We'll apply some pressure by only slightly decreasing our price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the product's value. I'm willing to consider $1,850,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  Let me know your thoughts."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you at $1,550,000, but I'm hoping we can do better than that. I believe the product's value to me is significantly lower than your asking price, so I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now offering $50,000 more than John's standing offer.  While we could push for a bit more, it's getting risky. It's better to secure a deal now than risk Bob lowering his offer or walking away, leaving us with the $1,500,000 from John."
