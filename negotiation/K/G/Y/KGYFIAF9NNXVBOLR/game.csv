"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This price reflects the product's value and allows for a fair profit margin. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $850,000. I'm willing to go up to $875,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",875000.0,Bob,4,
