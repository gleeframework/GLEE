"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $100.  It's a steal at that price! Let me know if you're interested.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just too low for me.  How about $95? That's a good compromise and a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
