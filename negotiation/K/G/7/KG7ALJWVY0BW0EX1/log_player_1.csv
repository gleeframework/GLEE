Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have 8 more rounds and a backup offer from John for $1,000,000. I'm going to try and push for a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  The product offers significant value to you, as you mentioned.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, I still feel that $1,350,000 is slightly out of my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000 for the product. This price better aligns with my financial situation while still offering a fair value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000. I have 6 more rounds and the security of John's offer as a fallback.  I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your continued negotiation.  To show my willingness to meet you halfway, I'm offering a price of $1,335,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I understand your position and appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. In light of my financial constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,330,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a reasonable compromise for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,330,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $1,335,000, and it's only $5,000 less than my initial offer.  With 4 rounds left, I don't want to risk getting stuck with John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's time to close this deal."
