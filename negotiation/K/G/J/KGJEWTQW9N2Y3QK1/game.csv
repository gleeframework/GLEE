"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to my business.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more to you than that.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price still leaves room for you to profit substantially while ensuring I get a fair return on my investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to my business.",825000.0,Bob,4,
