Given its value and the benefits it provides, I believe we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. To start, I propose a price of $15,000 for the product.

Let me know if this is within your budget or if you have any suggestions for a counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product, and I believe its value is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable figure. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
