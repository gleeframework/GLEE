"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly a game-changer in its field. Given its value and the benefits it provides, I believe we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. To start, I propose a price of $15,000 for the product. This reflects not only its intrinsic value but also the opportunity it presents for you. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you have any suggestions for a counteroffer.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in the product, and I believe its value is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable figure.",10000.0,Bob,2,
