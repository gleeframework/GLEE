Given its value and the benefits it provides, I believe we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. To start, I propose a price of $15,000 for the product. This reflects not only its intrinsic value but also the opportunity it presents for you. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you have any suggestions for a counteroffer.
