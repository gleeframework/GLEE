Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob immediately walks away.  Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer slightly below John's price to leave room for negotiation.
2. **Justify Your Price:**  You don't have to reveal John's offer, but vaguely mention high demand or the product's unique value.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its exceptional qualities and current market interest, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential value."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** It's polite, professional, and highlights the product's value without being overly aggressive.
* **The Price:**  Starting at $1,450,000 gives you room to negotiate down while still staying above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. How you respond will depend on his proposal and your negotiation skills."
