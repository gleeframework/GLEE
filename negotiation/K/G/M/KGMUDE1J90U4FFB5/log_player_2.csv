"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $1,100,000 is less than your maximum, it leaves little room for negotiation.
* **Potential for savings:**  You have 10 rounds and know Alice values the product at $800,000. This means there's significant room to negotiate a better price.
* **Don't rush to John:** Buying from John at $1,200,000 is a last resort. You want to exhaust the negotiation with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it, recognizing its potential value to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Counteroffer:**  This offer is a substantial drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating your serious intent to negotiate.
* **Reasonable Starting Point:**  $950,000 is well above Alice's value, allowing for room for compromise and leaving some profit for her.
* **Setting the Stage:** This counteroffer signals that you're willing to walk away if needed, putting pressure on Alice to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:**  While $1,050,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than the value you're willing to pay. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  You have 7 rounds remaining, and Alice's ""final offer"" is a common tactic. There's likely more room for negotiation.
* **Avoid rushing:**  Don't be swayed by Alice's pressure.  Buying from John at $1,200,000 is still a last resort. You need to keep negotiating with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  Given the market value and our respective needs, I'm prepared to offer $980,000.  This represents a significant step forward from my previous offer and leaves room for you to still profit. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** This counteroffer is only a $30,000 increase from your previous offer, signaling that you are taking her ""final offer"" seriously.
* **Reasoning with Value:**  Highlighting the market value (although you haven't provided it) and mutual benefit helps justify the price. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By stating it's a ""significant step forward"" and leaving room for profit, you subtly remind Alice of the potential for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,015,000. This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** $1,015,000 is still above your desired price point, even though Alice has lowered her offer.
* **Room for further compromise:** You have 5 rounds remaining. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate further, as indicated by her ""meeting in the middle"" statement. 
* **Avoid being pressured:** Don't be swayed by Alice's attempts to push you into a deal before you're ready. 

You can likely get the price down further. It's important to be patient and keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,015,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $995,000. This is a fair price, considering the market value and our respective needs. Let's close the deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 995000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but Significant Increase:** This offer is only a $20,000 increase from your previous offer, demonstrating your willingness to meet her halfway. 
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  You emphasize ""fair price"" and ""market value"" to make the offer more appealing.
* **Close the Deal:** This message implies a sense of urgency, suggesting that if Alice doesn't accept, you might be willing to walk away.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while aiming to reach a final agreement within your budget."
