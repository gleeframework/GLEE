"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  Given the market value and our respective needs, I'm prepared to offer $980,000.  This represents a significant step forward from my previous offer and leaves room for you to still profit. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us.",980000.0,Bob,4,
