"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000.  What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is way out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can go. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, however, $1,200,000 is significantly below its worth. How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I can't go above $1,300,000. Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,425,000. This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your budgetary concerns.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can't go any higher than $1,350,000. It's the best I can do, and I truly believe this product is worth that price.  Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
