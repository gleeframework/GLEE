"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to save as much money as I can.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $9,500?  This still gives you a good price, and allows me to get closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
