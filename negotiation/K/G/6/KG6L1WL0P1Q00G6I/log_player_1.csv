{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $135. This is above my minimum value of $120, but still potentially attractive to Bob, as the product is worth $120 to him.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I can potentially do better. I'm going to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $125. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $135 and Bob's offer of $120. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and close the deal."
