{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John immediately would be a waste of potential savings."

{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  Offering $900,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and might be enough to pique her interest. This allows for potential further negotiation while staying within your budget."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is still above my budget. I need to try and negotiate a lower price. There is still potential to get a better deal by continuing to counter-offer. Buying from John would guarantee the product but would be more expensive than potentially getting a lower price from Alice."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above my budget. I want to explore if there's room for further negotiation before committing to a price above $1,000,000.  There's a chance I can get a better deal, and I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a small increase from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. It's still within my budget and might be tempting enough for Alice to accept, especially considering she's been lowering her offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, her latest offer is still above my budget.  It's clear that further negotiation might not get me a price I'm comfortable with, and the risk of prolonging the negotiations is not worth the potential savings. Buying from John guarantees the product at a price I'm willing to pay, and it's time to finalize the purchase."
