"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring significant benefits to your business. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me.  I'm interested in purchasing it, but I'd need to see it closer to  $650,000. What could you do?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I can see that you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a price of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to your business. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that price is still a bit rich for me.   I could go as high as $725,000 if that works for you?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $725,000 and my previous offer of $1,000,000. I'm offering a price of $912,500. This is a compromise that should be more acceptable to both of us. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but that's still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $818,000 and call it a deal? ",818000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still think the product is worth more than $818,000. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'll meet you at $900,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,7,
