Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Offering the product at $140 leaves room for Bob to benefit ($10 profit) while you secure a significant gain ($40 profit). This strategy aims to strike a balance between profit maximization and the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
