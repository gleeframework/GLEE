"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do  $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need at least $10,500 for this. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? ",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,250 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,750.  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting a bit drawn out. I'm willing to pay $9,500, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if that works for you.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I need to stay closer to $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a fair compromise and avoids further negotiation.",9750.0,Alice,7,
