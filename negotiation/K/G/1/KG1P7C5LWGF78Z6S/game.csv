"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm definitely interested, $1500000 is a bit above my initial budget.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $1200000?  I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
