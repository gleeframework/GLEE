"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item for $1500000. It's a one-of-a-kind product that I'm sure you'll find highly desirable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no reason to immediately accept. You can try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice is willing to sell for less, especially if she needs to sell the product quickly.  Rejecting the offer allows you to explore this possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I'm definitely interested, $1,500,000 is a bit above my initial budget.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $1,200,000?  I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from $1,500,000 to $1,400,000.  This is a significant drop, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a smaller reduction in price.  At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice. It's within your budget and saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
