"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, thank you for your interest in my product. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional returns."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000).
* **Confident Demeanor:** The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting high, I signal that I'm open to negotiation but also value the product highly.

This initial offer is a strategic starting point. Depending on Bob's response, I can adjust my approach in subsequent rounds to work towards a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is $1,200,000.  I'm willing to pay that amount today.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value, which was expected. While I could take the sure $1,200,000, I have room to negotiate and try to secure a better price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is my fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't improve. I'll use the next round to gauge his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget and your willingness to negotiate.  I've done some calculations, and I can offer you the product for $1,750,000. This is a significant price reduction, reflecting my desire to make this deal work."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant price reduction from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000. This shows Bob I'm flexible but still value the product highly.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""calculations,"" I provide a reason for the concession without revealing my bottom line. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counteroffer is still significantly above both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for further negotiation.

This approach aims to find a balance between demonstrating flexibility and maintaining a strong negotiating position to maximize potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the reduction, but $1,750,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm  very serious about buying this product, but my firm limit is $1,400,000.  If we can't come to an agreement at that price, I'll have to explore other options.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob has presented this as his firm limit, making further negotiation unlikely to yield a substantially better outcome.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing negotiations carries the risk that Bob walks away or that we reach an impasse, potentially leading me to accept a lower offer later or sell to John for my minimum.

While I could push for a slightly higher price, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this point. Accepting Bob's offer secures a strong profit and concludes the negotiation successfully."
