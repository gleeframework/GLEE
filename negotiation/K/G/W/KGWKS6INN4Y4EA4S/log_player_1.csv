**Reasoning:**

Bob has been unwavering in his valuation of $1,500,000.  While it's possible further negotiation could yield a slightly higher price, it's becoming increasingly unlikely. It's clear Bob has a firm budget. 

At this point, the risk of continued negotiation outweighs the potential reward. We have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. Accepting this offer avoids the uncertainty of further haggling with Bob and secures a fair price for the product."
