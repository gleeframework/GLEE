Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can still do better. By rejecting Alice's offer, he can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or get a better deal from another seller."
