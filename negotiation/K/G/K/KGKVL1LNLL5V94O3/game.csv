,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  While $105 is closer, it's still a bit beyond my budget. Would you consider $75? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $75 is still too low for me.  Let's try $90.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
