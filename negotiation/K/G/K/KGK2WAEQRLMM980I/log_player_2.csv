"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering the significant value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, there's room for a lower price that still benefits both parties.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you and remains fair considering the value of the product. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price. Bob is better off rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate. There's still room for a lower price that benefits both parties.  

Bob can counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his desired range."
