"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This price is still significantly higher than what it's worth to you and allows for a profitable transaction. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,200,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you and remains fair considering the value of the product. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This price is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let's close this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
