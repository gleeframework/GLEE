``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value. This allows me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, which might encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone to foster a good negotiation atmosphere.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll need to analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value.**  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell for that price just yet.
* **I want to see if I can squeeze more out of Bob.** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to explore those possibilities.
* **Selling to John is always an option.** However, I'm not in a rush, and I'm hoping I can get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**  I'll need to carefully consider my counteroffer. I'll need to weigh the risk of losing Bob entirely against the possibility of pushing him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a fair price, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to show my commitment to making this happen. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  I've lowered my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Reaffirming my value:** I'm reminding Bob that my product is worth significantly more to me than the $900,000 he's offered, justifying the need for a higher price.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and focused on finding a mutually beneficial solution.

**Next Steps:** 

I'll need to carefully observe Bob's reaction to this counteroffer. If he rejects it again, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John.  I'll also consider whether to lower my price further, but only if it's strategically advantageous and doesn't significantly compromise my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to justify selling the product to him.
* **I believe there's still room for negotiation.** I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is an option, but I want to explore all options first.** I have more rounds left, and I'm not in a rush to finalize the deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll need to make a counteroffer that is reasonable but also keeps me closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'll need to carefully consider how much lower I'm willing to go without jeopardizing my own financial goals."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise but hold firm:** I'm lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,050,000, showing willingness to negotiate, but not compromising my minimum acceptable value too much.
* **Highlighting the compromise:** I'm emphasizing that I'm making a ""significant compromise"" to show good faith and encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Focusing on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair value for both of us,"" aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's response:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will need to decide whether to continue negotiating with him or sell to John. 
* **Consider a final counteroffer:** If I do continue with Bob, my next offer will likely be closer to $1,000,000. However, I need to be mindful of the remaining rounds and the potential risks of losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it, and I'm willing to meet you at a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While $975,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still not enough to justify selling the product to him.
* **I have limited rounds remaining.**  However, I believe there's still a chance to negotiate a higher price.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first.** 

**Next Steps:**

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. $975,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  To make this deal work, I need to be at $1,000,000.

What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

* **Prepare for the final round:** If Bob accepts, the deal is closed. If he rejects, I'll need to consider my options very carefully in the final round."
