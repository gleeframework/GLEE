"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $900,000 is a fair price, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to show my commitment to making this happen. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair value for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it, and I'm willing to meet you at a middle ground.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. $975,000 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  To make this deal work, I need to be at $1,000,000. This would allow me to make this sale, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  This is my final offer, I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.
