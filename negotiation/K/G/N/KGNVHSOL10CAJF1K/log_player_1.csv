"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you as I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000. I'm confident that once you see its potential, you'll agree it's a worthwhile investment."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches John's standing offer.  While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, there's still room to potentially secure a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but  $1,500,000 is below its worth. How about $1,800,000?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We've countered by coming down from our initial offer while staying significantly above both Bob's offer and John's standing offer. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, Alice. However, my budget allows me to only consider offers within a certain range. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is moving closer to our desired range, but we're still significantly above John's offer. It's worth pushing a bit further to try and capture more value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,700,000? This reflects the product's true worth while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're splitting the difference between our last offer and Bob's counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving and signals a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a strong price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $1,650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly demonstrating a willingness to meet in the middle, and this offer is a strong increase from his initial offer.  It's unlikely further negotiation will result in a significantly better outcome, and we risk pushing him away. Accepting now secures a good deal."
