Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $11,000, which reflects its significant value."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $12,000. Offering it slightly below his valuation at $11,000 maximizes the potential profit for Alice.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, the offer leaves a small margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Secure a Sale:**  Knowing there's a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John provides a safety net. However, prioritizing Bob allows for a potentially much higher profit."
