You can definitely do better than $10,000.  You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation.  It also shows Alice that you are serious about getting a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to your ideal price, you can likely get it lower with another counteroffer."

You're getting closer to your ideal price, but it's still important to be firm. This counteroffer is a compromise, but it shows Alice you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $11,000.  Since your maximum is $12,000, it's better to buy from John now and save the time and effort of further negotiations."
