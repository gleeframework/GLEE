"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that is significantly higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. It signals that I'm willing to compromise, but also that the product holds significant value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than the value I believe the product holds.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but maintains a fair price given the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

This counteroffer is a significant concession to Bob's last offer, showing my willingness to reach a deal. It is still above my minimum and maintains some value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum value, and while continuing the negotiation could potentially yield a slightly higher price, the risk of ending up with a lower offer or the negotiation collapsing is too high.  Selling to John at my minimum ensures a secure and guaranteed deal, which is the most sensible choice at this point."
