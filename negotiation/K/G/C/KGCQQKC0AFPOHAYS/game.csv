"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $18000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000, which is the maximum I can afford. If this works for you, we have a deal. Let me know your thoughts.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is my final offer for now.",16000.0,Alice,3,
