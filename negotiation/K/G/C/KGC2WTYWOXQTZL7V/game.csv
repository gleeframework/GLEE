"Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $10,500. I know it's worth that much to you, and this is a great opportunity to own a unique and valuable asset. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $10,000, so you're essentially getting a $500 discount by accepting this offer. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Alice,1,
