,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we split the difference and go with $105? That's a fair price, and it allows me to still make a profit while giving you a great deal.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm willing to pay.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference one more time - how about $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly.",100.0,Alice,5,
