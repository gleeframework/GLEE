"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to the middle of our potential range, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and optimistic tone aims to encourage Bob to engage and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  By starting at $120, I anticipate Bob might counter with a lower offer, allowing us to negotiate. 
* **Safeguard:** Remember, I can always sell to John for $80 if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I'm not desperate to sell, and I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob. There's room to find a middle ground more favorable to me.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John's offer of $80 provides me with a safety net. I can proceed with Bob's negotiation knowing I have a guaranteed alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we split the difference and go with $105? That's a fair price, and it allows me to still make a profit while giving you a great deal."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (sort of):** This counteroffer is a compromise, offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his initial offer.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  Framing the offer as a ""fair split"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and encourage him to accept. 
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $105 still gives me a decent profit margin.
* **Continued Negotiation:** By countering, I signal my willingness to negotiate further while showing that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but No Cigar:** While $95 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Remaining Rounds:** We have plenty of rounds left, and I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $80 remains a viable option, but I'm motivated to get closer to my desired price. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Rejecting this offer allows me to send another counteroffer that might close the deal or bring Bob closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference one more time - how about $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's latest offer and my previous counteroffer. 
* **Urgency:** Emphasizing ""closing the deal quickly"" subtly adds pressure and encourages Bob to accept before he potentially gets a better deal elsewhere.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  Again, using the ""fair price"" language tries to resonate with Bob's sense of equity.
* **Last Chance:** I'm nearing my minimum, so I'm prepared to accept something close to this price in the next round if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:**  Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my minimum of $80.  
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in round 6, and with only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob increases.
* **Potential Loss:** If I reject this offer and continue negotiating, I risk ending up with John's offer of $80, which would be a worse outcome.
* **Acceptable Profit:** While $92 isn't my ideal price, it's still a decent profit and allows me to avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
