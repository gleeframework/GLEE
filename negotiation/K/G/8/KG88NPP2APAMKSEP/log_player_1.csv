Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a strategy and offer for Bob:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding your BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement). Your BATNA is selling to John for $1,500,000.  This means you should accept no less than that amount. However, there's room to negotiate with Bob above his perceived value of $1,000,000.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it has the potential to significantly benefit you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but this offer stands as a strong starting point given the value this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High but Reasonable Starting Point:** $1,350,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value but still leaves you room to negotiate down while staying above your BATNA.
* **Confident but Open Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and presents the price as a strong starting point, not a final offer. This invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation.
* **No Mention of John:** Never reveal your alternative buyer. It weakens your negotiating position.

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  You get a great deal at $150,000 above his valuation.
* **If Bob negotiates:**  You have room to go down slightly, potentially meeting in the middle around $1,225,000.
* **If Bob rejects:** You're still in a strong position to sell to John at your desired price. 

Remember, negotiation is about finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  Good luck!"
