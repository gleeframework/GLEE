"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $8,000 to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit low for me. How about $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's split the difference and make this happen.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",10000.0,Bob,4,
