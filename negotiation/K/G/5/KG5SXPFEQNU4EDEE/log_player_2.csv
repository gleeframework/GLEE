{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal. Since Alice's initial offer is your maximum price, there's no downside to rejecting and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This is a bold move, but it establishes that I'm serious about negotiating and sets the stage for potential compromise.  We'll see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer.  It's not ideal, but I'm willing to accept this deal to avoid further negotiation and the risk of Alice getting more stubborn or the process dragging on."
