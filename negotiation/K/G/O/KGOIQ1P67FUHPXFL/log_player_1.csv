Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** A $1,000,000 price point gives Bob room to make a counteroffer without making it feel like a huge leap.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose out on significant value. 

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I'll either:

* **Accept a counteroffer:** If Bob offers a price close to $1,000,000, I'll likely accept to finalize the deal.
* **Counteroffer:** If Bob offers a significantly lower price, I'll counter with a price closer to my ideal price, but still above my minimum. 
* **Sell to John:** If negotiations stall or Bob's offers are too low, I'll switch to John, who is willing to pay my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe I can potentially get closer to my ideal price with further negotiation. 
* **Risk of losing John:** Selling to John guarantees my minimum, but there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly above his offer, hoping to close the gap without losing him completely.  I might propose a price of $950,000, for example."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While $900,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $950,000? It's a good middle ground, and it reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** I'm raising the price slightly, but not by a large margin, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to justify the price. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** $950,000 is still well above my minimum, ensuring a decent profit. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Negotiate further:** I'll observe Bob's reaction and either accept his counteroffer if he gets closer to my price or continue negotiating to secure a better deal.
* **Sell to John:** If Bob doesn't budge, I'll switch to John to guarantee my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can only go up to $920,000. That's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is only $30,000 away from my previous counteroffer, making it a strong offer.
* **Risk of losing a sale:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he'll walk away, and I might not be able to secure a better price with further negotiation.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag the process out, especially if I end up needing to sell to John as a backup.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal, securing a solid profit and avoiding further negotiations."
