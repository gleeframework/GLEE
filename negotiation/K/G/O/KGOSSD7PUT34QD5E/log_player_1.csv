I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a high starting point, knowing that Bob values the product at $1,200,000.  I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum goal of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer."

I'm counteroffering with $1,300,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum goal.  I believe this price is fair and leaves room for further negotiation."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum goal, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,150,000. This is a small drop from my previous counteroffer, but it signals my willingness to be flexible.  I believe this price is a good compromise and could lead to a successful negotiation."
