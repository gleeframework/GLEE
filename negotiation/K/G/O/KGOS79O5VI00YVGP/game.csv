"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product well worth the investment. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $13,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $14,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",14250.0,Alice,5,
