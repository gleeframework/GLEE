"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but there's room to potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $700,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and shows my seriousness in wanting to buy the product, while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is now the same as John's price.  There's no incentive to continue negotiating with Alice.  Buying from John guarantees the product at my maximum price."
