"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $800,000? This is a fair price that allows you a good profit and allows me to stay within my budget. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
