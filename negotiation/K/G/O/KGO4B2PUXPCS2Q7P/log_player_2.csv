"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still significantly higher than the product's worth to her ($800,000). There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  It's worth rejecting the initial offer and trying to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm still trying to save as much money as possible, so it's worth rejecting and counteroffering again."
