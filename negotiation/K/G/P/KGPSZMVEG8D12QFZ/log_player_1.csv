"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but  $2,300,000 is not within my budget. I could consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. While $2,300,000 represents its true worth, I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000.  This offer reflects a significant reduction on my end and ensures you're getting a good deal on an exceptional product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,850,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair offer that recognizes its value while fitting within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to our minimum acceptable price. We're still within the negotiation window, and selling to John would only be a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,550,000? This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're trying to meet me halfway. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,350,000. This is a strong offer, and I hope we can make a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We are now very close to our minimum, but Bob's offer is still significantly under. He has shown a willingness to move, so we'll hold firm and see if we can push him a bit closer to the $1.5 million mark."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting close.  To be frank, I have a hard limit on what I can accept.  I can come down slightly to $1,475,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."",
