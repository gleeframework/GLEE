Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, we're getting close.  To be frank, I have a hard limit on what I can accept.  I can come down slightly to $1,475,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, her ""final offer"" of $1,475,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000.  At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a price that's significantly better than John's offer. It makes more financial sense to cut losses and secure the product from John at the guaranteed lower price."
