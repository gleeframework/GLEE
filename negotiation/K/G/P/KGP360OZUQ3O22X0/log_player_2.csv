Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal! I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we try $85? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and it's better to secure the product at the known $80 price from John."
