"Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,500,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,100,000 at this point.  This reflects the value I see in it, and I'm confident we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,100,000 is below my initial asking price, I understand the need to find a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your need to get a fair price, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
