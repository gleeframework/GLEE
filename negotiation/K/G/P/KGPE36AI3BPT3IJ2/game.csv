"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending under $85. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50?  That way, we both get a fair price.",87.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I believe $85 is still a reasonable price. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $86?",86.0,Bob,4,
