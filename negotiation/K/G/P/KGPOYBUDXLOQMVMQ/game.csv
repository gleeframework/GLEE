"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I recognize the value of the product, but that price is too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $950,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's worth.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $950,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  While $725,000 is still lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $875,000. I believe this price reflects a significant compromise on my part while still recognizing the value of what's being offered.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, you're clearly interested in this product, and I respect your negotiation skills. I'm willing to accept a lower price, but I need to be realistic about its value. How about $837,500? This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise.",837500.0,Alice,7,
