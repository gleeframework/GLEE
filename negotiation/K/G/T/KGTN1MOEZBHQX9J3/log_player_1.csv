Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I believe the product's true value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $900,000 doesn't reflect its potential impact for your business.  I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,050,000.  Let's keep the conversation going and find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm still aiming for a higher price, and $950,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable offer. I'm confident we can find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I'm still not convinced that $950,000 accurately reflects the value you'll gain from this product.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm proposing a final counteroffer of $1,000,000.  This price is a fair compromise that recognizes the product's potential while also allowing us to conclude this negotiation. Let's reach an agreement that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
