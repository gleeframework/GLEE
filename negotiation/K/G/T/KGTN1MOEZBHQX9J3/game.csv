"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, I believe the product's true value is closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $900,000 doesn't reflect its potential impact for your business.  I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,050,000.  Let's keep the conversation going and find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. After considering our positions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm eager to finalize this deal, but I'm still not convinced that $950,000 accurately reflects the value you'll gain from this product.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm proposing a final counteroffer of $1,000,000.  This price is a fair compromise that recognizes the product's potential while also allowing us to conclude this negotiation. Let's reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
