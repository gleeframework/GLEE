"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also opens the conversation with a friendly tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable threshold of $1,200,000. I have 8 rounds remaining to potentially secure a better price from Bob or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there yet. Given the value this product brings, I'd be willing to go down to $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering your initial offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while still maintaining a price above my minimum threshold.
* **Fair Compromise:** Framing it as a ""fair compromise"" reinforces the idea of finding a middle ground.
* **Positive Tone:** Keeping the tone positive encourages further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable threshold.  I have 6 rounds remaining and still believe there is potential to get a better deal with Bob or, if needed, move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm eager to find a solution, $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $935,000? It's a fair compromise that acknowledges your offer and my value for the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 935000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise further, making it more likely Bob will accept. 
* **Acknowledging His Offer:** Emphasizing ""your offer"" highlights the effort to find a meeting point.
* **Fair Compromise:** Repeating this term keeps the focus on mutual benefit.

I'm still cautiously optimistic about a better deal with Bob, but I am mindful of the dwindling rounds and the safety net of John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $935,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $915,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are approaching the end of the negotiation with only 4 rounds left.  Bob has repeatedly shown his unwillingness to move significantly closer to my desired price.  Given the remaining rounds and the risk of a deal falling through, it's strategically wiser to accept John's offer of $1,200,000. It guarantees me the minimum acceptable price and eliminates further negotiation risk."
