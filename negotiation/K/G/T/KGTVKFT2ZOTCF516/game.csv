"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $125. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate further, Bob. I can see you're serious about getting the product. I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to make a living, so I'm offering it to you for $130. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",130.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking we can meet in the middle of our last two offers, so I'm offering it to you for $122.50. This is my final compromise, and I hope you'll accept it.",122.5,Alice,7,
