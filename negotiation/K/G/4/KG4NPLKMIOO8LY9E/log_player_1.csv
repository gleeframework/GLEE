Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is close to the middle ground between my minimum price ($12,000) and Bob's estimated value ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit.
* **Being friendly:** I'm using a friendly tone and framing the offer as a fair deal, hoping to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By asking Bob his opinion, I'm opening the door for further discussion and potentially finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Having a fallback option:**  I'm aware of John's offer of $12,000, which provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Even though Bob rejected my initial offer, it's likely he's still interested in the product.  There's potential to negotiate a higher price in the next round.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I have John's offer of $12,000 as a backup, so I'm not under pressure to accept a price that's below my minimum. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not willing to settle for a price that's too low and keeping the negotiation open for a potentially more profitable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum price. This shows flexibility while also protecting my profit margin.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and potentially make him more receptive. 
* **Leaving the door open:** I'm asking Bob for his opinion, allowing him to accept or propose a further counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to come down to $13,000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that much. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,500. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer a higher price, it's unlikely Bob will go any higher. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject his offer, there's a risk he might walk away entirely, leaving me with only John's offer of $12,000.

Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice. It secures a sale that's close to my minimum price and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
