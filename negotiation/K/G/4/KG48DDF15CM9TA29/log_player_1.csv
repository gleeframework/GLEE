{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  I'll be prepared to negotiate down if necessary, but I want to see how he responds first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I'm willing to pay up to $120 for it. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a good deal for a product of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm offering $150, which is my minimum price. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to Bob, as it's still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I am still looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose $130 as a potential price for the product. Please let me know if this is something we could work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'd rather sell to John for $150 and avoid any further negotiation."
