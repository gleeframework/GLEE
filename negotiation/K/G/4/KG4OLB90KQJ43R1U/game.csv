"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down to $900,000? I think that's a fair offer.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point.  Would you consider $950,000?  That feels like a good compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to make a profit. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we settle at $1,000,000 even?  That's a fair price that lets you make a profit and works for me.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
