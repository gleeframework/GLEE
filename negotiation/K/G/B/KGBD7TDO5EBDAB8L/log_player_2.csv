"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a price that's fair to both of us.  Would you be interested in buying it for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice is offering it for $90. While this is a good deal, you can get it for the same price from John.  It's always better to get the best price possible, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $100 is the optimal choice."
