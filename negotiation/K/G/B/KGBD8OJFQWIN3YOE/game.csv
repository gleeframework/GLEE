"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering your own valuation.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  I'm confident this price is fair and allows us both to come to an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
