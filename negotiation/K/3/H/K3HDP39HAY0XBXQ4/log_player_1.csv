Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be a great asset to you.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** My message emphasizes the product's potential benefit to Bob, hoping to create a sense of value for him.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for further discussion and a potential counteroffer.
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $15,000, so I'm not desperate to make a deal with Bob. This gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and far below my initial offer of $12,000.  
* **Leverage with John:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000. This gives me strong leverage in the negotiation with Bob.
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is too far below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is still a great price considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a significant compromise from my initial price of $12,000, showing flexibility but not completely giving in to Bob's low offer. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** $10,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose too much money. 
* **Appeal to Value:** I reiterate the product's value in the message, hoping to remind Bob of its worth and encourage a reasonable offer. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation. If Bob still refuses, I can either lower my price slightly or stick to my guns and consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** $8,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While it's closer to my initial offer, it's still not a good enough deal for me. 
* **John is the Safe Bet:** I have a guaranteed sale to John at $15,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's final offer. 
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob would take more time and effort. It's not worth the risk of potentially getting a lower price or dragging out the process. 

By selling to John, I guarantee a profitable deal and avoid the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
