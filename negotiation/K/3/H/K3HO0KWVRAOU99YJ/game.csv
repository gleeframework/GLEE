"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Let me know if this is possible.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it would be a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I still believe $8,000 is a fair price for the product. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $8,500 is still significantly below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  Let's settle on $9,250.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it will allow me to make a reasonable profit.  If you're not interested in this final offer, I'll have to move on to other options.",9250.0,Alice,5,
