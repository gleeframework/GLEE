Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to come down that much.  I'm willing to consider $1,000,000.  It's a fair compromise, and it still allows me to get a good price for this product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, and it's only $50,000 less than my last counteroffer. It's a good deal, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000."
