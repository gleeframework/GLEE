Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $100 to me, I'll start with a price that's slightly higher than that.

{""product_price"": 120}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay this price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, so I'll choose option 2 and reject his offer. I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still lower than my original offer.

{""product_price"": 90}

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle or come close to my original offer."
