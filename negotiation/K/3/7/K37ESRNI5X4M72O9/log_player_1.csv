"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for something worth at least $100 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price to leave room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's worth to me, subtly implying it's a good deal for Bob. 
* **Open-ended:** The message is inviting a response and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 I need to make this deal worthwhile.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $100 gives me the leverage to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $95? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a smaller reduction:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not giving in entirely. 
* **Emphasize the deal's value:** I reiterate the product's worth to emphasize its value and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Urgency and finality:**  Using ""Let's close this deal!"" subtly implies that I'm ready to walk away if he doesn't accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $95 is a good deal for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is below my minimum acceptable price and significantly lower than what I could get from John.
* **Limited negotiation room:**  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is a much better outcome than risking further negotiation with Bob. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit than to continue negotiating with a buyer who is unlikely to meet my minimum price."
