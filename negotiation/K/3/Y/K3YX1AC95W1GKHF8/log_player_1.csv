"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, knowing that Bob values the product at $120. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize the value for Bob, hoping to create a sense of urgency.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $100 price leaves room for Bob to counter and allows me to reach a mutually agreeable price within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $80. Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum, but I can still do better.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to my ideal. 
* **More rounds:**  I have 8 more rounds to reach a deal and don't want to settle for a price that's too low too early."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a small adjustment:** I'm adjusting my price only slightly to show I'm willing to compromise but still want to maximize my profit.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Keep the pressure on:**  By adjusting my price slightly, I'm pushing Bob to consider closing the deal before more rounds pass."
