"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to you ($120). There's room for negotiation to get a better price. You're also not desperate to buy right away, as you can always go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's still above Alice's value for the product ($80), but lower than her initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying but also trying to get a better deal.  I'm confident she'll accept as it's a decent profit for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm happy to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $95, which is still a good deal for me. It's closer to my desired price point and a better deal than buying from John for $120.  It's worth accepting the offer and closing the deal."
