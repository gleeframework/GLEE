"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $9,500. This is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,500 is still a little high for me. How about $9,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a decent profit and me to stay within budget.",9000.0,Bob,4,
