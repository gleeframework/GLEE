"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $950,000 is still above his target of $800,000. There's room for negotiation, so it makes sense to reject the initial offer and see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to $800,000 as possible.  A counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and still leaves room for potential negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point for the counteroffer, especially given the limited rounds available."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget. There are still rounds left, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price, but Alice seems unwilling to budge significantly. A counteroffer of $875,000 is a compromise â€“ it's a step up from his previous offer, but still a substantial discount from Alice's latest offer.  This shows Bob is serious about buying but also keeps the pressure on Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, despite being a slight reduction from the previous round.  With only 5 rounds remaining, there's not much time to waste.  Bob should continue to negotiate, aiming for a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, especially as she is rejecting counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 885000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate, but she's still holding out for a higher price.  Bob needs to find a sweet spot that's attractive enough to Alice but still within his budget.  $885,000 is a small increase from his previous counteroffer, showing he's serious about buying but also unwilling to go much higher. With limited rounds left, it's important to try and find a solution that both parties can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and Alice is not budging significantly from her price.  While $910,000 is closer to Bob's target than previous offers, it's still too high. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high.  It's wiser for Bob to secure the product from John at $800,000, ensuring he gets it within his budget and avoids the potential for Alice to keep raising the price."
