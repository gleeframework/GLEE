Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin to split between you and Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to price Bob out.  A good strategy is to aim for a price that gives you a significant portion of the profit, while still leaving Bob with a good deal.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something that could be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:**  $1,150,000 secures you $150,000 above your minimum and leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain compared to his alternative. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value to Bob, you're emphasizing why this price is justified.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is dynamic.  Bob might counter-offer.  Be prepared to potentially adjust your price slightly, but remember, you have a strong alternative with John at $1,000,000."
