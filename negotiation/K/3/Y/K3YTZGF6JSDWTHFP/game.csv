"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you be willing to do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $75 is still too low for me.  Let's try $85.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still find it a worthwhile purchase.",85.0,Alice,5,
