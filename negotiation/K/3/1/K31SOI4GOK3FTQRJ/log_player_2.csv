"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  It's more advantageous to try and negotiate with Alice.  Even if the negotiation fails, buying from John for $1,000,000 is still a better option than accepting Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price well below Alice's initial offer. This should signal that I'm serious about buying the product but am also unwilling to pay the initial price. This will hopefully force Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's closer to my maximum limit, I believe I can negotiate further. John's offer is a safety net, so I'm not under pressure to accept a price I'm uncomfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still believe the price is too high.  The goal is to slowly push Alice toward my desired price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, I'm still unwilling to pay that much.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with continued negotiation.  John's offer remains a strong backup option if the negotiations fall apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, closing the gap between our prices.  This shows Alice I'm committed to a deal but still believe her price is too high. I'm aiming to push Alice towards accepting my offer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I've been steadily increasing my offers, and Alice has been lowering hers, so I'm optimistic that we can reach a mutually acceptable price.  John's offer is still my safety net, so I'm not in a rush to accept anything above $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final offer. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is my maximum limit.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll buy the product from John at the same price.  This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept my offer or risk losing the deal."
