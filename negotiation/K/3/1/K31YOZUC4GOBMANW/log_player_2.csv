"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Since your maximum price is $100, and Alice is offering it for $100, it makes sense to accept her offer. There's no benefit to buying from John at the same price."
