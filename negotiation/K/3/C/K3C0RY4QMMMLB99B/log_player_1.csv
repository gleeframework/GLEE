"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's a bit lower than the value Bob places on the product ($100) but still leaves room for me to increase the price in future rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, I'm not willing to settle for just $5 more than what I could get from John.  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  I believe this is still a fair price, considering the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm still hoping to get a higher price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

I'm going to counter with $89.  This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but it's still a fair price considering we're nearing the end of the negotiation.  I believe Bob might be willing to meet me at this price."
