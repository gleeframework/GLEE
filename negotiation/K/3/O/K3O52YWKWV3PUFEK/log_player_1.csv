Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob can make him more inclined to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  A $12,000 starting price allows for potential counteroffers without dropping below my minimum acceptable price.

**Strategy:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he counters, I'll aim to meet him halfway, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. If the negotiation stalls, I can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $15,000 minimum.
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob to get a higher price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $15,000.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range. I'll aim to find a middle ground that will be acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product extremely valuable."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the price as a fair compromise, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintaining my minimum:** $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, giving me a buffer in case Bob counters again.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept. If he rejects again, I'll consider if a further compromise is worthwhile, or if I should simply sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $10,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Can we meet in the middle at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Even with Bob's slight increase to $9,800, it's still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk of stalling:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a stalemate, wasting time and potentially reducing my overall profit.
* **John's offer provides certainty:**  Selling to John guarantees me the highest possible price and avoids any further risk or negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll politely decline Bob's offer and inform him that I've accepted an offer from another buyer for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, and I value our back-and-forth. However, I've received another offer that's closer to my asking price. While I'm open to considering your offer, I'm going to need something closer to $11,500 to make this work.  Let me know if you're willing to come up to that point. Otherwise, I'm going to have to move forward with the other offer."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Honesty and Openness:** I'm being upfront with Bob about the other offer, which creates a sense of urgency.
* **Increased Counter Offer:**  I'm raising my offer slightly but still below my desired price. It shows a willingness to compromise while also maintaining a higher value.
* **Decision Time:** This counteroffer puts the pressure on Bob to decide if he's truly interested in the product at a higher price.

**Strategy:**

If Bob still refuses to come up to $11,500, I'll move forward with the offer from John, as it guarantees me a higher profit and avoids further negotiation."
