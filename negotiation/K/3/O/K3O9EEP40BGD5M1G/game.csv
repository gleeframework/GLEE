"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $11,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my budget.  How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a fair compromise between our two offers.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still a bit above $9,750. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer you the product for $10,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm confident it's still a fair deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems we're getting close.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further, how about $10,000 even?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,7,
