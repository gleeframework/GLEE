Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a good starting point because:

* It's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* It's lower than the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000), giving him an incentive to accept. 

This strategy allows me to:

*  Maximize my potential profit.
*  Gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate.

If Bob rejects my offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and proceed accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than John's offer of $800,000, it's still lower than my desired price. I believe I can push for a higher price, considering the product's value to Bob.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to secure a deal closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering Bob's offer of $1,100,000 with a price of $1,150,000. This is a compromise:

* It's higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating my desire to get a better price.
* It's lower than my initial offer of $1,200,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to:

*  Find a middle ground that's agreeable to both parties.
*  Increase my potential profit while maintaining a good relationship with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is close enough to my initial goal to make it worthwhile.  I'm accepting his offer because:

* **It's significantly higher than John's offer:**  I would be leaving a substantial amount of money on the table if I chose to sell to John.
* **Negotiations have reached a stalemate:** There's a risk that if I continue negotiating, Bob might walk away, leaving me with only John's offer. 

By accepting, I ensure a good profit and avoid potential loss."
