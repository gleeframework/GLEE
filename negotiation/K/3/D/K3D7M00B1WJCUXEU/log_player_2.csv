"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,500 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get the product for less by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the counteroffer process and try to drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering the value of the product. However, $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting his negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  He's using a lower price to signal his intention to negotiate and hopefully get a better deal. He's also framing his message in a positive way, expressing appreciation for Alice's offer while also emphasizing his desire to find a price that works for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm confident in the value this product brings.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than $11,000. While $11,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue the counteroffer process and try to push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a little better deal. I'm happy to meet you at $10,750.  Let's see if we can find common ground there."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to slowly inch closer to his target price while maintaining a positive and cooperative tone. He's offering a price that's slightly higher than his previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This shows that he's willing to compromise but also wants to get a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,900. I believe this price accurately reflects the value you'll gain from this product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get a lower price than $10,900.  While Alice has made concessions, Bob is likely to get a better deal by continuing the negotiation and pushing for a lower price.  He's still within his budget and has a few rounds to get a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer! I value your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,800?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to be persistent but also reasonable in his counteroffers. He's now suggesting a price that's just slightly below Alice's most recent offer, showing a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better deal. This approach helps maintain a positive negotiation dynamic without becoming overly aggressive."
