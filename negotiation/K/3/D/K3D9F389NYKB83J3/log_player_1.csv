"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1800000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price significantly above my minimum.  This will give me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good deal. I'm also taking into account that I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I need to get significantly more than $800,000 to make this worthwhile. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,500,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it's a compromise from my initial price. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not going to settle for a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still offering a very low price. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,200,000, and I have the option to sell to John for that price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000.  This is a significant increase from Bob's last offer but still below my initial offer. I want to show him I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also not going to give away the product for a low price. I'm hoping this will encourage him to make a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not quite there. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher. I'm starting to run out of rounds, so I need to be careful not to let the negotiation drag on too long."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a smaller increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I'm getting closer to accepting a deal. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us, while still ensuring I get a decent price. With only 3 rounds left, I need to make a decision soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, I need to be realistic. Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is not bad, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. It's too risky to continue negotiating with Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000, ensuring a good price and guaranteeing a sale."
