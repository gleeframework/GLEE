"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and it's closer to my minimum price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. How about $1,075,000? ",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $1,090,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
