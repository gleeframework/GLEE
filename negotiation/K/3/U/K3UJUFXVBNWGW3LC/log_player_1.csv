{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point, leaving room for potential compromise while still ensuring a profit for Alice. It also highlights the value Bob would receive from the deal, encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to save a bit more money. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent profit, Alice can likely do better. By rejecting Bob's offer, she can counter with a higher price, potentially securing a deal closer to her initial offer.  It's important to remember that Alice has a backup option with John, so she doesn't need to settle for a price she feels is too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,500, so I'm offering $10,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has come up to $10,000, which is very close to Alice's last offer of $10,500.  Alice is already making a solid profit at $10,000, and continuing to negotiate risks the possibility of Bob walking away or Alice needing to settle with John for a lower price.  It's a good time to close the deal and secure the profit."
