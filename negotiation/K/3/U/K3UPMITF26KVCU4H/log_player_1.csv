Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Anchoring:** By stating a high initial price, you ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he negotiates down, the starting point influences his willingness to pay. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually decrease your price, but always keep your minimum ($12,000) in mind."
