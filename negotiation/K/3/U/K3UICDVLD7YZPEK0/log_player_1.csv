"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is because the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, so there's room for negotiation. I'm hoping to maximize my profit while still leaving room for Bob to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for $12,000 when the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $16,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price and hopefully reasonable enough for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm going to offer $15,500. This is a small step up from Bob's last offer, but it's still within a reasonable range. Hopefully, this will be enough to close the deal and secure a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $14,000 is getting close to my minimum price, I'm still hesitant to accept. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a slightly higher price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $14,500. This is a compromise, offering a bit more than Bob's last offer but still within a reasonable margin. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has rejected my offer, and we're back to $14,000. There's only a small difference between our positions, but it's not enough for me to risk another round of negotiation. I'm running out of time and the risk of not reaching a deal is too high.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a fair price and ensures I don't lose out on potential profit."
