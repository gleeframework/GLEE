"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you might be interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation.  I'm also making the message friendly and inviting to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I need to make at least $150 to make this worthwhile. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $125?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm proposing $125 which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I earn a decent profit.  I'm keeping the message friendly and focused on finding a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $125 is still a bit high.  Let's try $95. This is as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$95 is still too low for me. I'm sticking to my minimum of $150 and will continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good deal, but $95 is still too low. I'm willing to go down to $135. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $135, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm flexible but also  firm in my expectations. I'm also reiterating the benefits of the deal for both of us, hoping to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $135 is still above my budget. I'm firm on $100. It's a fair price, considering we're both getting something out of it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$100 is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for less than $150. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $100 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $115. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and urging Bob to close the deal to avoid further negotiation."
