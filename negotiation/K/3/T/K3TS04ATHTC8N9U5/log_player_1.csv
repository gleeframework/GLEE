{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer sets a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also highlights the value of the product to potentially sway Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only able to pay up to $150 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price. Accepting it ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation, which might lead to no sale or a lower price."
