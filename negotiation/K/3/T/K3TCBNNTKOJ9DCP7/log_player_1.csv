I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, leaving room for negotiation while still aiming for a high profit. I'll see how Bob reacts to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can get more. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering with $1,400,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

Bob's offer is too low. While I could continue to counteroffer, it seems he's not willing to meet my price.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum acceptable value."
