Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than his initial offer, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my value of $12,000. I have 8 more rounds and can always sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $9,200 is closer to my target price, I still have time to negotiate and I can always sell to John for $12,000.  I'll try to push Bob a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you about sticking to your budget, but $9,200 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $9,400? It's a small step up from your last offer, but it's a price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to feel good about the deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,200 and $9,400. Would you consider a price of $9,300? I think that's a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price of $12,000, I've already had a few rounds of negotiations and I'm running out of time. $9,300 is a decent compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $12,000, considering I'll still make a profit."
