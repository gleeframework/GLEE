"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $9,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,200? I think that's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you about sticking to your budget, but $9,200 is still a bit low for me. How about we settle on $9,400? It's a small step up from your last offer, but it's a price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to feel good about the deal. Let's make this happen!",9400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,200 and $9,400. Would you consider a price of $9,300? I think that's a fair compromise that works for both of us.",9300.0,Bob,6,
