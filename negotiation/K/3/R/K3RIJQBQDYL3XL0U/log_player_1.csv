"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see the value and hopefully accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still confident we can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can close the deal closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position.  I'm willing to go up a bit, but $110 is still too high for me. How about $108?  That's a good compromise, and I'm sure we can make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price of $115. I'll reject his offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  How about we settle at $112?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $110 is a good compromise. It's just slightly lower than my last counteroffer, and it's getting close to what I'd like to make. Given that we've already had a few rounds, I think it's a good idea to accept his offer and finalize the deal."
