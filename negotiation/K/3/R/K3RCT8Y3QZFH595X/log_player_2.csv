"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000.  This is a great price for such a valuable item. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price.  Since Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, it's worth exploring further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,400,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,300,000?  I'm very interested in your product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1300000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, and I believe it's fair considering your interest in the product.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price from John ($1,200,000), but it's getting closer.  Considering the possibility that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy in this scenario.  Bob can save $50,000 compared to buying from John, while still achieving a decent price."
