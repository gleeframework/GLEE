Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1400000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $1200000. Would you be willing to consider $1300000?  I'm very interested in your product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
