Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($1,500,000). This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so I'm aiming for a price within a reasonable range where we might reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's still a good deal for me, and it's likely that further negotiation will only lower the price further.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
