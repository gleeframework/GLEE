# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts!

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a compromise that I believe will benefit both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point.  At $925,000, you are still saving a significant amount of money compared to John's price of $1,200,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing the opportunity."
