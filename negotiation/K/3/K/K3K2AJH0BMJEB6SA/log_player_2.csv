"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's below your maximum, you can likely get a better price by counteroffering.  You have room to negotiate since you value the product at $1,200,000 and Alice is willing to sell for less than $900,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering its value to me is $1,200,000. I believe this is a great opportunity for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $925,000 is still too high.  You still have some room to negotiate, and you can likely get a better price by counteroffering again.  You're not desperate, and you have a fallback option with John if the deal falls through."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $887,500?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $887,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $912,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to me is $1,200,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $912,500, which is significantly closer to your desired price.  While you could counteroffer again, it's likely you won't get much lower. There's a chance Alice will stick to her price and you'll end up buying from John for a higher price. At this point, accepting the offer and saving $287,500 compared to John's price is the best course of action."
