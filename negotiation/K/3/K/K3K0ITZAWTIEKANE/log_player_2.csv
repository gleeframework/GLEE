"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to inform you that I'm looking for a price of $1,200,000 for the product. This is the minimum I'm willing to consider, and I'm confident it's a fair price given its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is far too high for him, and he can get the product for $800,000 from John.  Negotiation is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm afraid $850,000 is not sufficient for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high. Bob should continue negotiating to try and lower the price further. He has a strong backup option with John, so he doesn't need to settle for a price that's uncomfortable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfortable range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to achieve our goals. Let's bridge the gap and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her previous offers, it's still too high for him. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. He still has a strong backup option with John, so there's no need to rush into an agreement that doesn't work for him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my commitment to closing this deal. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $975,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000 again, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a free maintenance package and a 1-year warranty. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While the extras offered by Alice are nice, the price is still too high for Bob. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, but Alice is being stubborn. Bob should continue to try and push for a lower price, and if she doesn't budge, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer and the added extras, but $1,075,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $975,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  If you're not willing to come down, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 975000}

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're firm on $975,000, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000, and I'll throw in an additional 6 months of premium support to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob has one round left, and he can still get a better deal from John.  He should try one more time to negotiate with Alice, and if she refuses to go lower, he can buy from John."
