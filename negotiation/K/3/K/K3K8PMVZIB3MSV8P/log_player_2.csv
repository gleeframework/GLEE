"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really appreciate. It's worth $100 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a very reasonable price. How does $90 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is overpriced. You know you can get the product for $100 from John, so there's no need to pay $90. By rejecting the offer, you might be able to negotiate a better price with Alice or get it for your maximum price from John."
