"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000, reflecting both the value to you and the potential loss I'd incur selling to John. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget of $1,200,000, and I think this price is a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would be a win-win for both of us. If you're not interested, I'll have to proceed with John's offer.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'd be willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I'm trying to get as close to my budget as possible while still getting a good deal.",920000.0,Bob,6,
