Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $1,000,000 gives me a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Addressing Bob's value:** I acknowledge the product's worth to him, implying I'm open to a deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the farm. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's closer to my desired price, $950,000 is still significantly below what I know the product is worth to him. 
* **I have leverage.** I can reject Bob's offer, knowing I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay $800,000. This gives me the opportunity to potentially get a better price from Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm prepared to counter with a price closer to my ideal range, giving Bob the chance to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000, reflecting both the value to you and the potential loss I'd incur selling to John. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:**  I've reduced my price, demonstrating I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain leverage:** $975,000 is still a substantial gain for me, and significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Finality:**  I'm framing this as a final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or walk away.
* **Addressing John's offer:** Mentioning John's offer reinforces my position and adds urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $925,000 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget of $1,200,000, and I think this price is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above John's offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly higher than what John is offering. I'm not desperate to sell and can afford to hold out for a better deal.
* **Room for compromise:**  I can likely still negotiate a higher price. Bob has expressed a willingness to pay more than $925,000, and I believe there's still room for us to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my position of power and force him to make a final decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $925,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would be a win-win for both of us. If you're not interested, I'll have to proceed with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to meet Bob halfway by offering $950,000, which is the midpoint between my previous offer and his current offer.
* **Urgency:** I'm reminding Bob of John's offer to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to accept.
* **Win-Win:** I'm highlighting the mutual benefit of this deal, emphasizing that it's a good outcome for both of us.
* **Finality:** I'm again framing this as a final offer, pushing Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'd be willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I'm trying to get as close to my budget as possible while still getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalled:**  Bob's offer of $920,000 is only a slight improvement over his previous offer and is still below my desired price.
* **Risk of further decline:** There's a risk that if I reject this offer, Bob might lower his offer again.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000, which is close enough to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Time is money:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take time and lead to uncertainty.  

Selling to John guarantees me a good profit and avoids further potential losses in negotiation."
