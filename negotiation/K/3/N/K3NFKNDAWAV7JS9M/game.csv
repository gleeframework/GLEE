"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. While $11,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $12,500. It's still a good deal for you, considering the value, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget. I'm still very interested, but $12,500 is a little too steep for me. How about we settle at $11,750?",11750.0,Bob,4,
