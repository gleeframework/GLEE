{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is cheaper than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a good starting point:

* **It's significantly lower than Alice's offer:**  This shows Bob is serious about getting a better deal.
* **It's above Alice's minimum value:**  This keeps the negotiation moving forward.  Alice has an incentive to consider the offer.

By offering $105, Bob leaves room for a potential compromise while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's maximum, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice is likely to be willing to come down a bit further, as $125 is still more than her minimum value.  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a better price for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer while remaining below Alice's last offer. This counteroffer is:

* **Still below Alice's offer:**  Shows Bob is committed to getting a better price.
* **Closer to Alice's last offer:**  Signals Bob is serious about buying and willing to compromise slightly.

This offer could potentially lead to a successful negotiation, as it's likely within Alice's acceptable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is the best price Bob has received so far. It's significantly cheaper than buying from John. While Bob could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and decide to sell to someone else.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price without the risk of losing the deal."
