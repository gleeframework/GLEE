"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on a price of $9,000? It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit by offering $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. How about we meet at $8,500? It's a small step back from my original offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
