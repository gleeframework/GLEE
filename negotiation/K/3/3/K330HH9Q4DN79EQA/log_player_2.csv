"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm starting with a price of $100, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to Bob, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening Low:** Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes a negotiation zone and signals his serious intent to purchase.
* **Reasonable Offer:** $80 is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for compromise while still being within Bob's $100 limit. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and polite tone helps build rapport and encourages Alice to consider the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget.  I can come down a bit, but $80 is unfortunately below my minimum price. How about $90?  I believe it's still a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $90 is still within Bob's budget and represents a 10% discount from Alice's original offer.
* **Limited Time:**  Alice's counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.  It's likely that further haggling could result in a lower price, but Bob risks losing the deal entirely if he continues to reject offers.
* **Avoid John:**  While John offers the product at $100, there's no guarantee that the product from John will be the same quality or meet Bob's needs as well as Alice's product. 

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible *while still getting a product*.  Accepting Alice's offer at $90 achieves this."
