"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  What do you think?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
