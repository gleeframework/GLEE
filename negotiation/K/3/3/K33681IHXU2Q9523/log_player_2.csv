"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $2,000,000 is above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for a lower price.  There's no reason to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

Bob should start by making a bold counteroffer at half of Alice's initial price. This will signal to Alice that he is serious about getting a good deal and is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,750,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. There are still rounds left to negotiate with Alice and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

Bob should continue to be aggressive in his counteroffers, but this time he should make a smaller jump to $1,250,000. This shows Alice he is willing to negotiate but is also serious about getting a good deal. This price is still well below Alice's offer and closer to his target, while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $1,600,000 is closer to his ideal price, it's still more expensive than what he can get from John. He has a few more rounds to get a better deal from Alice and shouldn't settle for anything less than his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

Bob should raise his offer to $1,400,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice he is serious about buying the product but still trying to get a better price. This price is closer to Alice's last offer but still lower than John's price, giving him leverage to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is the same price as what John is offering, and since Alice is willing to go down to this price, it indicates that this is likely a good deal. He has no reason to risk further negotiation, especially with only a few rounds left, and potentially losing out on a good deal."
