"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's valued at over $1 million to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. My initial price is $950,000.  This reflects the significant value it offers, while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's talk!",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $800,000 to you.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low.  While I value our potential partnership, I need to ensure I receive a fair return on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still well below the value it holds for you.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $800,000 to you.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but $875,000 is still too far from what I need to make this deal work.  To demonstrate my commitment to this partnership, I'm willing to lower my price to $890,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal and make it a win-win for both of us.",890000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000, but I need to be convinced that this is the best deal I can get. Can you consider one more concession?",880000.0,Bob,6,
