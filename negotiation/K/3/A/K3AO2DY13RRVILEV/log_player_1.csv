"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's valued at over $1 million to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer for your business. My initial price is $950,000.  This reflects the significant value it offers, while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's talk!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $800,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm confident I can get a better deal by rejecting his offer and negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too low.  While I value our potential partnership, I need to ensure I receive a fair return on this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still well below the value it holds for you.  Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $800,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has moved closer to my minimum acceptable price, $875,000 is still below my desired outcome. I have 6 more rounds to negotiate, and I believe I can push for a higher price.  I am confident that I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but $875,000 is still too far from what I need to make this deal work.  To demonstrate my commitment to this partnership, I'm willing to lower my price to $890,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal and make it a win-win for both of us."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000, but I need to be convinced that this is the best deal I can get. Can you consider one more concession? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is only $10,000 less than my minimum acceptable price of $890,000. Considering we only have four rounds remaining, it's better to accept his offer and secure the deal.  There is a good chance that I won't be able to get a higher price with the remaining rounds, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  Selling to John for $800,000 is also a possibility, but accepting Bob's offer nets me $80,000 more."
