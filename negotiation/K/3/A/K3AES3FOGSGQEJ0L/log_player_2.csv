Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective on the price, $7,000 is significantly below its value. Could you meet me halfway at $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $8,500 is still a little steep for me. How about we settle at $7,750?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a pattern here of lowball offers. I want to be fair, but I also know this product's worth. My final offer is $8,250. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting impatient and more firm with her offers. While you might be able to get the price lower, you risk her walking away entirely. Accepting $8,250 is a good deal considering her starting point and the fact that you'd pay $10,000 to John."
