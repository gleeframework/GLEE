Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in! I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $150, which is higher than my minimum of $120. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob isn't willing to pay that much.
* **Open to negotiation:** I explicitly say I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts. This shows I'm flexible and willing to work with him, which can encourage him to counteroffer.
* **John as backup:** Having John as a backup buyer at $120 provides a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation opportunity:**  While Bob's initial offer is unreasonable, it shows he's interested. I can use this opportunity to try and negotiate a better price in the next round.
* **John as backup:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $120, so I'm not losing out by rejecting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  $60 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $105? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing I'm still willing to negotiate.
* **Compromise:**  I'm suggesting a price that's a midpoint between my last offer ($150) and Bob's offer ($60). This shows I'm flexible and open to a deal.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm using positive language (""split the difference"", ""let me know what you think"") to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $70 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **More negotiation room:**  It's likely Bob is willing to go higher than $70. Rejecting his offer allows me to try and push him further.
* **John is a strong backup:** Selling to John for $120 is still a good option if negotiations with Bob don't work out. I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $85? That's a significant drop from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm again offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer ($105) and Bob's offer ($70). This shows consistency and a willingness to work towards a deal.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my offer. This can help him see the value of the product and potentially encourage him to accept.
* **Still above minimum:** $85 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, which gives me some room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway this time, so how about $77? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $77 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's unclear if we'll be able to reach a mutually acceptable price. There's a risk of further negotiation dragging on and potentially leading to a stalemate.
* **John's offer is secure:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me a good price without the uncertainty and potential frustration of continuing negotiations with Bob. 

Given the current situation, selling to John is the most sensible and risk-free choice. I can secure a decent profit without the added complexity and potential for further delays in negotiation."
