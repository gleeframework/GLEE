Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also maximizes your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be slightly bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message emphasizes the product's exclusivity and value.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $1,450,000 leaves you with a significant profit margin while still being potentially appealing to Bob.  
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** Negotiation is a dynamic process. Be prepared to adjust your offer slightly if Bob comes back with a counter-offer. However, never go below your $1,500,000 baseline."
