# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you. It's not just an item; it's an investment in excellence and functionality tailored to meet your needs. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, we believe it's worth more than what others are willing to pay. Given its significance to you, I propose to sell it to you for $10,000. This price reflects its true worth while offering you a fair deal. I trust this proposal aligns with your expectations and budget. Should you have any questions or need further details, please don't hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, the bottom line is that her offer of $10,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and the guaranteed price of $8,000 from John.  You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
