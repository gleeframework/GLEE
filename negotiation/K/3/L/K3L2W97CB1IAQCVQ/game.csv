"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is too steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd only be willing to pay something closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit beyond my budget. Could you do $75? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to compromise at $95, but that's as low as I can go.",95.0,Alice,5,
