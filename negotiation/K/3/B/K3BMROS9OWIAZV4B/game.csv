"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, let me know and we can discuss further.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1100000. Can you consider this offer?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1250000. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to reach your minimum price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1150000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1150000, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1200000, which is the absolute minimum I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, let's finalize the deal now.",1200000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're trying to reach your minimum price, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1170000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",1170000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1170000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to budge from my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'll meet you at $1200000. If you're not willing to meet me at my minimum, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options, including selling the product to another interested buyer.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
