Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a price that is higher than his perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives me a good starting point to gauge his interest and see if he is willing to come closer to my desired price. 

If he rejects, I'll need to consider if his counteroffer is worth pursuing or if it's better to sell to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still far below what I'm willing to accept. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll need to see if I can get him to come up in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $950,000. This is a compromise that is closer to his offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to meet him halfway, he'll be more open to increasing his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it is a significant profit for me and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob potentially leading to a lower price or a rejection that forces me to sell to John for $1,200,000."
