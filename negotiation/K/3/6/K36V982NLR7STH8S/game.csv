"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer, but $8,500 is still a bit too steep for me. Could we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,250 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $7,875?  It's a good compromise that benefits us both.",7875.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $7,625. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",7625.0,Alice,7,
