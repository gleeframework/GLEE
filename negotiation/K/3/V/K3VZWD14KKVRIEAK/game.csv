"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of the product.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $8,500?  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do at the moment.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,4,
