Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is leverage. You know John will buy the product for your minimum acceptable price, giving you a strong fallback position.  Therefore, you should aim high with Bob, attempting to capture as much of the value difference as possible.

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its exceptional qualities and potential, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High Starting Point:**  The offer starts significantly closer to your minimum price ($1,500,000) than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. You could potentially come down slightly while still staying well above your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the product's value without directly referencing Bob's perceived value. 

**Outcome:**

* **If Bob accepts:** You make a significant profit above your minimum.
* **If Bob rejects:** You move on to John, securing your minimum acceptable price."
