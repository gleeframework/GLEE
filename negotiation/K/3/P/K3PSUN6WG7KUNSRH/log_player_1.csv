Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me a good margin, but it's not too high that it's likely to scare Bob away immediately. It's a good starting point to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and hopefully it's attractive enough for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price, and it avoids further negotiation."
