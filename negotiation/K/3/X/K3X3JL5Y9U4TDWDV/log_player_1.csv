Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would bring you significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000.  This offer stands only for a limited time, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your $1,200,000 baseline.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

**Important Note:**  This assumes you don't have time to engage in multiple rounds of negotiation with Bob. If you have more time, you could start higher and slowly decrease your asking price."
