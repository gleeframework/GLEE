Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You're secure knowing you have a backup offer of $800,000 from John.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting high allows room for negotiation while aiming for the maximum profit margin. 

This strategy:

1. **Creates urgency:**  The 24-hour limit encourages a quicker decision.
2. **Leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you can potentially still get a price higher than John's offer.
3. **Aims high:**  You maximize your potential earnings if Bob accepts the initial offer."
