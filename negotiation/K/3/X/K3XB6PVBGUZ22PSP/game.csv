"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this valuable product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This offer still gives you a significant advantage, and it's a good starting point for us to work from.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price tag. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950,000. I think this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $950,000 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $1 million to make this work.  How about we split the difference and agree on $1,000,000?  This offer is still beneficial to both of us, and it ensures we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $975,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay above $990,000 to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's agree on $995,000.  This offer is a fair compromise, and it allows us to close this deal without further delay.",995000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to go one last step to close this deal.  $980,000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm confident that this product will be worth every penny to you.  Let's meet in the middle at $985,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",985000.0,Alice,9,
