"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product.  I've valued it at $1750000, reflecting its unique features and potential. I'm open to discussing the price further, but I believe this is a fair starting point. What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1750000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Given its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1100000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1100000 is lower than my initial asking price, I understand your perspective.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This would still give me a good return on my investment, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1400000 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1200000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and allows me to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $1200000 is still below my desired range, I'm open to finalizing a deal.  Let's meet in the middle at $1300000. This allows me to make a reasonable profit, while also staying within your budget. What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1300000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I believe we can finalize the agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
