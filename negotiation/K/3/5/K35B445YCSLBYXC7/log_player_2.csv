Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, considering its value to you. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. Let's close this deal and both be happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000.  It's time to cut our losses and go with John's guaranteed offer."
