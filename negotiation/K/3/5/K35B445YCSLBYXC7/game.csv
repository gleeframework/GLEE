"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $5,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $5,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, considering its value to you. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $7,000 just doesn't work for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's a fair price considering the value this product brings to you. Let's close this deal and both be happy.",8500.0,Alice,5,
