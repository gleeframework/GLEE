"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with an ambitious price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully get a good price from Bob. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I believe there's potential to get more. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,400,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still maintaining a good profit margin. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable counteroffer and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm willing to take a slight loss compared to selling to John, but I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and continue trying to close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping that Bob will recognize my willingness to compromise and finally accept. I'm also aware that I only have a few rounds left, so I need to make a move that will likely secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to budge on his price. We're running out of time, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable value. While I would prefer to get a higher price, selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures I don't lose out on the deal entirely."
