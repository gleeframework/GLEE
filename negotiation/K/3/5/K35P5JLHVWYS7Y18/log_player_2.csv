Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but there's a significant gap between our valuations.  This product offers substantial returns, and I'm confident in its value.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has moved closer to my price range, $1,650,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000. I'll continue negotiating to see if we can bridge the gap further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I appreciate you moving towards my position. To be candid, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,525,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,525,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While she's shown willingness to negotiate, I don't see a clear path to a deal within my price range. Given that I have a reliable alternative with John, who is willing to sell me the product for my maximum budget, it's the most sensible option to buy from John and avoid further negotiations."
