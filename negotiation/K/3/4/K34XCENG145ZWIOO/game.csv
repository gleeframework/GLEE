"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to my budget. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from $11,500. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. Can you consider this price?",10250.0,Bob,4,
