Round 2

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $90 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That would give us both a good deal. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're both trying to find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm happy to come down a little more, but $95 is still too low for me.  How about $100?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it's closer to my cost.  Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
