Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also important to note that I'm aware of John's offer of $1,000,000, which acts as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $1,050,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's a price that still allows me to make a profit, but also acknowledges Bob's willingness to pay. I believe this counteroffer is more likely to be accepted than my previous offer and provides a fair starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to get $1,000,000, it's only $20,000 less. I'll accept Bob's offer to ensure a sale and avoid further negotiation."
