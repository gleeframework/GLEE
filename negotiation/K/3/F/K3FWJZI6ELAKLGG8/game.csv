"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $12,000.
