"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is way above your budget and the product's worth to you. You should definitely negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally wise to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Within Budget:** The offer of $80 is well within your $100 budget.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will give you valuable information about how low Alice might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to your budget, $115 is still more than you want to spend, especially knowing you have a guaranteed option at $100 from John. There's room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a significant increase from my last offer and a reasonable price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  Increasing the offer to $95 shows Alice you're willing to negotiate, but you're not budging too quickly.
* **Below Budget, Above John:** This counteroffer keeps you below your $100 budget while still offering Alice a price potentially more attractive than John's $100 offer.
* **Final Push:** This offer could be your last before resorting to John, so it needs to be enticing enough for Alice to accept."
