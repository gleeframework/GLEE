I'm offering Bob the product for $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my guaranteed floor price of $1,200,000 with John. This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of rejection. 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Potential for higher profit:**  A $300,000 gain is substantial.
* **Strategic risk assessment:** I know I can secure $1,200,000 with John. This offer gives Bob an incentive to negotiate while still leaving me with a significant profit margin.

I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to accept this offer."
