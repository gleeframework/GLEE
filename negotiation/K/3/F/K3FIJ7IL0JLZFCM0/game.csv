"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price is significantly above my budget. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to  $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, my initial valuation stands firm.  To move us closer to an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of this product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, that price is still too high for me to consider. To be frank, I'm only comfortable going as high as $1,100,000.  If you can't meet that, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm confident in the unique value this product offers, and I believe it's worth a significant investment.  My final offer is $1,750,000. This is a substantial concession on my part, and I hope you'll consider it carefully.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your final offer is still a significant leap from what I can justify.  I can go up to $1,200,000, but that's my absolute limit.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to go with John.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
