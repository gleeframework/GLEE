"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Since the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for the same price, accepting the offer is the best option. There's no benefit in rejecting and buying from John at the same price."
