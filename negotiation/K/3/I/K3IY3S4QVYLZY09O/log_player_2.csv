"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's a high-quality item worth a lot to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, there's no information about the product's value to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to test the waters. This gives him room to negotiate while still showing Alice he's serious about buying the product.  A $3,000 difference is substantial and will hopefully encourage Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $7000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still more than Bob wants to pay.  He's shown willingness to negotiate, and there's still room to get a better deal.  Rejecting and counteroffering again keeps the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product is worth that to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a smaller counteroffer this time, showing that he's willing to compromise but also pushing for the best price he can get. This offer is closer to Alice's latest offer, increasing the chances of reaching a deal without going to John."
