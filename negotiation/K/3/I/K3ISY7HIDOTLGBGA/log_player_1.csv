Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John, it's always best to try for the highest possible price first. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at your minimum acceptable price doesn't leave any room for Bob to counter-offer.  There's a chance he might be willing to pay slightly more than $8,000.
* **Strong Opening:**  By starting at your desired price, you set a firm anchor for the negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob will reject the offer outright.  However, since you have John as a backup buyer, you're not losing anything by aiming high initially."
