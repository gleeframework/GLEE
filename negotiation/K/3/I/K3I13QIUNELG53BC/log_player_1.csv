Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe holds significant value for your operations. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I am open to discussing this further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, I can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's high value without revealing my minimum acceptable price. This might make Bob more receptive to a higher price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to discuss the price, giving Bob the opportunity to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price that's still significantly above my minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While a high initial offer might make Bob walk away, the potential reward of selling it for $1,200,000 outweighs the risk of losing him as a buyer, especially with John as a backup."
