"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. It's a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you meet me halfway and consider a price of $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1400000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I can offer you a deal at $1600000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1600000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you reconsider and meet me at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $1500000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a deal at $1550000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
