,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but I'm not sure I can go higher. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can offer it to you for $9,250. This is a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but $9,250 is still a little too high for me. How about $9,100? I'm really hoping to close this deal, but that's the highest I can go at this point.",9100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $9,500 is too high, but I can do $9,300. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can wrap up the deal.",9300.0,Alice,7,
