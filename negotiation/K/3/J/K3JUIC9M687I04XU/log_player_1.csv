"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it at $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $100, as I know the product is worth at least $80 to me. This allows for room to negotiate and gives Bob a sense that the product is valuable. I'll be ready to adjust the price if necessary, but it's important to start strong!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if we can reach a middle ground. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm open to negotiation, $80 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $85? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to save some money 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is closer to my target price and is still above my minimum. It's a good deal for both of us. I'm willing to accept this and close the deal."
