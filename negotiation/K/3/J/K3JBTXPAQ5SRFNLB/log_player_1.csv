Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a healthy margin above my minimum, but is hopefully still attractive enough for Bob to consider. I'll be ready to negotiate if he counters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,000.  This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my initial ask.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to go below my minimum. Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me my desired profit, so I'll take that option."
