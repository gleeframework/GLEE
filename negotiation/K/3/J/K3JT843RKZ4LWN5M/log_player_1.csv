Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both you and Bob, starting with a higher price allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Respectful Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob without being overly aggressive.
* **John as Leverage (Implied):** While not explicitly mentioned, the fact that you have another buyer willing to pay $1,000,000 gives you a strong bargaining position. 

This offer aims to:

1. **Test Bob's willingness to pay:**  See if he's willing to go significantly above his perceived value.
2. **Leave room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, you can potentially still reach a price above your minimum. 

Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John."
