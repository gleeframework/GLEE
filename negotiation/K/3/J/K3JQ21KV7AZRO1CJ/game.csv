"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we say $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for coming down, Alice. While I appreciate the offer, I'm working with a tight budget.  Could we do $11,000? That would work for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not sure I can go as low as $11,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we split the difference and call it $12,250? That's my final offer.",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,250. I'll tell you what - I'll meet you at $13,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. It's the highest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,7,
