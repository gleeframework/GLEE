"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $825,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $825,000 is still a little too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
