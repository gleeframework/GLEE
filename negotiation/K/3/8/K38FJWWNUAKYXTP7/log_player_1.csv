"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. This is a chance to acquire something truly unique."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a strong offer. This anchors the negotiation closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) leaves space for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""truly unique"" subtly emphasize the product's value. 
 
This strategy allows for flexibility in later rounds while aiming to secure a favorable deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $950,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below your minimum acceptable price ($800,000). Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Demonstrate Your Position:** Show Bob that you're serious about the product's value and not willing to settle for a lowball offer.
* **Guide the Negotiation Upwards:** By rejecting his initial low offer, you encourage Bob to move closer to your desired range.

You'll use the next round to make a counteroffer that balances staying in the negotiation with moving towards a mutually agreeable price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 significantly undervalues this product and the unique benefits it offers. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?"", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This message acknowledges Bob's offer while firmly reiterating that your price is based on the product's value.
* **Strategic Concession:** By moving down $75,000, you demonstrate a willingness to negotiate but in a controlled way.
* **Target Price:** The $875,000 counteroffer is a strong middle ground that still provides you with a significant profit margin. 

This approach aims to bring Bob closer to your desired outcome while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I still believe we can find a fair price. Based on my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches your minimum acceptable price. While you might be able to push for a slightly higher price, it introduces risk:

* **Time Constraint:**  You have a limited number of rounds, and continued negotiation might not yield a significantly better outcome.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a guaranteed offer for the same price from John. There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and you risk losing both offers if negotiations stall.

Accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and minimizes risk."
