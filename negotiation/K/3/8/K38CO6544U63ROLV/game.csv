"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! I believe it's a valuable asset that will benefit your business greatly.  My asking price is $1,450,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product,  $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is a little too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize this deal.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This seems like a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go right now. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
