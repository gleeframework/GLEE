Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to sell to John for $80. Bob's offer of $75 is still too low, and I'm not sure I can get him to go higher. John is a guaranteed sale at a price that's reasonable for me."
