Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

While Alice is getting closer, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure we'll reach a price I'm comfortable with. To avoid further delays, I'll buy from John for $8,000. It's a little above my target price, but it's still a good deal and I'm confident it's the best outcome given the current situation."
