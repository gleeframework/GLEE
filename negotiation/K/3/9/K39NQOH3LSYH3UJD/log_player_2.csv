"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($100). There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $108. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget ($120).** 
* **This offer is closer to Bob's desired price ($105) than John's offer ($120).** 
* **There's a good chance that Alice will reject a counteroffer, increasing the risk of Bob having to buy from John.** 

While Bob could potentially get a slightly better price by continuing to negotiate, it's a gamble. Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product for a good price and avoids the risk of having to pay more to John."
