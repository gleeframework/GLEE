"Bob, I have a product that I think would be a great fit for you. I understand its value to you is significant, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects that.  I'm asking $12,500 for it.  This is a great deal for both of us, as it's a fair price for you and allows me to make a healthy profit. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,
