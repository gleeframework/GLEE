"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm confident you'll get a great return on your investment. Would you like to make it yours for $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, $9,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,500 is still too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay $10,750?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're still in discussion. However, $10,750 is still a bit shy of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about we meet at $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy we're getting closer.  How about we meet in the middle again at $11,000?  That would give us both a fair deal. ",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to settle at $11,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $11,500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I've invested. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
