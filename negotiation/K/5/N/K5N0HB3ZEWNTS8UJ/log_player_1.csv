Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, I am looking for a more reasonable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price.  I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,000,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000 to show you my commitment to working with you. This is a significant compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. After considering your latest offer, I would like to counter with a price of $1100000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still believe the product holds more value than $1,100,000. I'm going to try to push for a slightly higher price in the next round. I have time, and there's still a chance I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for what this product can offer. To show you my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to go down to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll need to move forward with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your patience and flexibility, Alice. Considering your last offer, I would like to counter with a price of $1125000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to my last offer of $1,150,000, and it is higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  Given that we are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. It secures a higher price for the product than I could get elsewhere, and minimizes the risk of losing a sale altogether."
