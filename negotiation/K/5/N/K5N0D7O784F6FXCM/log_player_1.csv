Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value proposition:**  Highlighting the product's value can make the price seem more reasonable.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize profit:**  $120 is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Start negotiation:**  This price point gives Bob room to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Keep John as a backup:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can easily switch to John for a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below Bob's perceived value of $80. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There's room to negotiate a higher price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a more profitable deal.
* **John is a safety net:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for $150, guaranteeing a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $60 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $90? That's still a good price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  My counteroffer of $90 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Positive tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone can keep the negotiation positive. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:** $90 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, potentially leading to a deal.
* **Maintain a profit:**  $90 is still above my minimum acceptable price and closer to my initial target.
* **Avoid rushing to John:**  I want to explore a deal with Bob if possible, as John offers a guaranteed profit but no potential for higher earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Could we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is getting closer, $75 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** There's still room to negotiate a higher price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price and see if he's willing to budge further.
* **John remains a safe option:** If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for $150, ensuring a profit.

**Next Steps:** I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $90, trying to find a midpoint that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $85? That's a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** $85 is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $90 and Bob's offer of $75. This shows a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price, making it seem more reasonable.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone can help keep the negotiation positive and prevent it from breaking down.

**Strategy:** This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a better price:** $85 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Find a compromise:**  Offering a middle ground increases the chances of reaching an agreement with Bob. 
* **Avoid rushing to John:**  I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob before resorting to selling to John, as John offers a guaranteed profit but no potential for higher earnings."
