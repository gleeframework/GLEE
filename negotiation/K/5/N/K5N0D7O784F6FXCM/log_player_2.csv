Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see we're getting closer!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $85? That's a fair price considering the product's quality and value. Let me know what you think!

Alice is unlikely to go below $85.  It's better to secure the product from John at $80 and avoid further back and forth."
