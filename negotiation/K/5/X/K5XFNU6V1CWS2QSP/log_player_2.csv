"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $12,000. I think it's a great deal for something of such high quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his maximum budget, and he has a better option with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is already a competitive price for this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is a better price than her initial offer, it's still above his desired price point. He can still get the product for $8,000 from John, so he should continue negotiating with Alice."
