"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $175 for it.  It's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 175} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $150. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob to justify the price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates a willingness to negotiate, so Bob knows a counteroffer is possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $130 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's message shows he's willing to negotiate, and I believe there's room to find a price that works for both of us. 
* **More Rounds:** I have 8 more rounds to reach a better deal. Selling to John right now would be a missed opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $160.  This is a great product and a fair price for its value."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still want a higher price than his offer.
* **Compromise:** I'm decreasing my initial offer by $15, demonstrating a willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm again highlighting the product's value to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $140.  Let's split the difference and make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not there yet:** While $140 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **More rounds left:**  I still have 6 rounds to try and get a better offer.  
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  Bob is showing interest and willingness to negotiate. It's worth trying to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  How about we meet in the middle at $150? That's a fair price considering the quality of this product, and it gets us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making a final offer that's my minimum acceptable price, showing that I'm serious about getting a deal done. 
* **Compromise:** I'm offering to split the difference again, signaling my willingness to meet halfway.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept, emphasizing the ""good deal"" for both parties."
