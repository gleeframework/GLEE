"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000.  What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I understand your perspective on the price. However, $12,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
