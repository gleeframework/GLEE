"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This allows for potential negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm also mindful of my minimum value of $15,000 and the limited rounds, so I'll need to be strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $10,000 is far below my minimum value of $15,000. It's too risky to accept at this point, as I have more rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is still above my minimum value but a significant decrease from my initial offer. I want to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also maintain a price that's fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still going to reject it. I'm committed to getting closer to my initial asking price, and I believe I have the time to do so. I'm also cautious about selling to Bob at a price that's so much lower than my initial offer, as it might set a bad precedent for future negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is a slight decrease from my last offer, showing flexibility, but still above my minimum value. With fewer rounds remaining, I need to find a balance between being firm and accommodating."
