I'm starting with a significantly lower price than Alice's offer, hoping to get a good deal.  This is a bold move, but I'm hoping to establish a lower price point quickly."

Alice is still too high, and I'm not confident she'll come down much further.  I want to see if I can get her closer to my desired price point before resorting to buying from John."

I'm going to make a final push for my desired price. If Alice rejects this, I'm going to buy from John."

Alice is not budging much.  I'm getting closer to my budget but still above my ideal price. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John, as I'm unlikely to get a better deal with Alice."
