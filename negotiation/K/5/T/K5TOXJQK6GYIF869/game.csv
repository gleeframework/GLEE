"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  How about $10,250?  It's a small step up from your last offer, and it gets us closer to a deal.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers.  How about $9,875?",9875.0,Bob,6,
