"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value that I believe justifies a higher price. How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. Let's try this - $1,250,000, and I'll include [mention a valuable bonus or perk related to the product]. This offer reflects the true value of what you're getting.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not interested in the bonus or perk, and I still think $1,250,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so how about $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
