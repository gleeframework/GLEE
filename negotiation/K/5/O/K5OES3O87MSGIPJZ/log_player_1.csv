Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product has significant value, but I'm still not convinced that $1,350,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. Let's try this - $1,250,000, and I'll include [mention a valuable bonus or perk related to the product]. This offer reflects the true value of what you're getting."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not interested in the bonus or perk, and I still think $1,250,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your previous offer, so how about $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,225,000 is a significant profit, and continuing to negotiate risks pushing him away entirely.  It's better to secure a very good deal now than risk ending up with John's $1,000,000 offer."
