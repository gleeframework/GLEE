"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting high with $1,500,000. This allows for potential negotiation room while still exceeding my minimum value of $1,000,000. This first offer is a strong starting point, and will hopefully encourage Bob to engage in a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 meets my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can achieve a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reducing my price from $1,500,000 to $1,200,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still remaining above my minimum value of $1,000,000.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and will hopefully encourage Bob to make a better offer in the next round."
