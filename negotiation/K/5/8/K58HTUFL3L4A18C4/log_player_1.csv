"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully motivates Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250? This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10250}
``` 
I'm proposing a price that's slightly closer to my desired price, but still within Bob's acceptable range.  I'm aiming for a compromise that's more favorable to me while keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,800 is still below my minimum. Let's try $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to stick with my minimum price for now. I'm hopeful that Bob will finally accept, especially since this is a reasonable price for the product."
