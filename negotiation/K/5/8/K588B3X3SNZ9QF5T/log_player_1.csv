Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down if he finds the price too high. 
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  A strong initial offer can help you understand how much Bob values the product. If he accepts immediately, you know you could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, you can always come down in price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response."
