Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is our backup buyer at $1,500,000, we want to see if we can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,350,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing somewhere above his perceived value of $1,200,000.
* **Balance with Risk:**  While we could aim higher,  a price too close to $1,500,000 might make Bob walk away immediately. This price balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
