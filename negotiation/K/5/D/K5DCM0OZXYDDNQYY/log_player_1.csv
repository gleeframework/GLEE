Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has value, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,100,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you holding firm on the value.  However, to be honest, $1,210,000 is really pushing the limit of what I can justify. I'd be willing to stretch to $1,190,000, but that's my absolute best.  If that doesn't work, I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to push for more, Bob has signaled this is his limit, and we're still significantly above John's offer. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
