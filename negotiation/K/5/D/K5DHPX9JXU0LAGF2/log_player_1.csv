Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer gives you a decent profit ($1500) while still being attractive to Bob, as he would still make a profit of $500 if he accepts.  This strategy balances the potential for a higher profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and you having to settle for John's offer."
