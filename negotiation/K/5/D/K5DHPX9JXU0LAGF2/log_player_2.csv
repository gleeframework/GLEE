"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice for $11,500** saves you $500 compared to buying from John. 
*  While you could reject the offer and potentially get a lower price from Alice, it's not guaranteed. Buying from John for $12,000 is your fallback option, so it's safer to accept Alice's offer and secure the product for a lower price."
