You can do better than $12,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product is worth $15,000 to her and I'm willing to pay $10,000 elsewhere. It gives her some profit and keeps me within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is a better price than John's $10,000, but still within my budget. It's time to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation."
