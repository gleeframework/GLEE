"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $82.50? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure if $82.50 is the best value for me. I'm willing to go up to $80, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your limit, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $81? It's still a great value for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",81.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $81. I'm willing to meet you at $78, and that's my final offer. Can you accept it?",78.0,Bob,6,
