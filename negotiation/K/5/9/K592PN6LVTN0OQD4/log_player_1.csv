Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe is worth a lot to the right person. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a relatively high price ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation and potentially maximize my profit. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, hopefully making him more interested.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation by mentioning ""Let me know what you think."" This avoids making it seem like a take-it-or-leave-it offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'd be happy to pay $12000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $12,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum of $10,000. I'm not willing to sell for less than that. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $10,000 would be a safe option, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired amount, but still within a range that I believe is reasonable and could be acceptable to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a good price for both of us, and I think you'll find the product is well worth it. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $13,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still a fair price for me, but it shows flexibility.
* **Highlighting Value:** I again emphasize the value of the product to Bob, reinforcing the idea that it's worth the price.
* **Positive and Enthusiastic:** My message is positive and enthusiastic, creating a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to accept the deal. 

**Next Steps:**

I will be watching closely to see if Bob accepts my counteroffer or if he makes another counteroffer.  Based on his response, I'll adjust my strategy accordingly.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider my options, including selling to John, or making another counteroffer."
