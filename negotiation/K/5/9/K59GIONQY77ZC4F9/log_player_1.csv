{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, giving me room to negotiate down if necessary.  It's also a good starting point because it's below the product's value to Bob, making it potentially attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I really like the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still lower than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850,000 just doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still protecting my profit margin.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is still above what John is offering.  To avoid risking losing the sale altogether, I'm going to accept his offer."
