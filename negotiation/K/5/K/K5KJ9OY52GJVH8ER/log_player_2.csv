"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly higher than both your maximum and Alice's perceived value. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for offering! While I agree the product looks great, $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider something closer to $90?"",
 ""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Polite & appreciative:**  Maintains a positive tone for negotiation.
* **Expresses interest:**  Shows you're still keen but not at any cost.
* **Significant drop:**  The $30 reduction signals you're serious about a lower price.
* **Within reason:** $90 is still above Alice's value, leaving room for her to counter."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $90 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $100.  That still allows me to make a fair profit while hopefully getting you a great deal.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but $100 is still too high. We have room to push lower before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 95
}
```

Here's why this is a good counter:

* **Acknowledges movement:**  Recognizes Alice's price drop, building goodwill.
* **""Meeting in the middle"":** Frames it as a collaborative solution, not a battle.
* **Small increment:** The $5 reduction shows you're willing to negotiate but not budge much.
* **Direct question:**  Encourages Alice to respond rather than just stating a price."
