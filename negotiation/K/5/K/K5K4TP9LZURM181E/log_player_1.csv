Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $125 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also allows for a friendly, open-ended dialogue with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell the product for my minimum price yet. I believe I can get a better price by negotiating further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, and $100 is a good starting point.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $112.50?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 112.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $105? That's a pretty good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good compromise. While it's still a little lower than I'd like, it's better than the $100 that John would pay. It's also a good price considering Bob is willing to pay $150 for the product."
