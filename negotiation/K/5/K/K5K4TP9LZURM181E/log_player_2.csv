"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $125 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $125 is a bit too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly. It's a long shot, but it's worth trying to get the product at a price close to its value to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, and $100 is a good starting point.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $112.50?  That way we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is willing to negotiate, which is good. Let's see if we can push a little further down before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $105? That's a pretty good compromise."",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer, but showing willingness to meet in the middle. This keeps the negotiation moving while still trying to get a good deal."
