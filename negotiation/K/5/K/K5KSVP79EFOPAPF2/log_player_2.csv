"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which I believe will bring you significant value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still significantly more than your maximum budget and what John offers. You can save a considerable amount ($300,000) by going with John."
