"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in your product, but $100 is a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $92.50? This is a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still too high for me.  Let's try $87.50. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's closer to your price point and within my budget.",87.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's settle on $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,5,
