"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $90. Could you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and try to get closer to my desired price point.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $100 because I believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to $110 for this product.  It truly is a valuable item, and I'm confident you'll see the benefit in that price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save some money. Would you be willing to consider $95 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $95 is tempting, I'm still aiming to get closer to my desired price point of $100. I believe I can negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob. If I can't, I'm confident I can get my minimum price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to find a good price, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $105. This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to consider $102 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $102 is just above my minimum price of $100.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm not willing to risk further negotiations and potentially end up with nothing. Accepting this offer ensures I get a profit and avoids the risk of a lower counteroffer from Bob or losing the sale to John."
