"Hi Alice, I really appreciate you being open to negotiation.  $200 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $80?  That's my absolute top end.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget.  $80 is quite a bit lower than what I need to sell the product for.  How about we meet in the middle at $140?  I'm willing to compromise to make this work for both of us.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to go up to $100.  Let's see if we can find a compromise there.",100.0,Bob,4,
