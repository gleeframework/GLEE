"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating.  There are still 9 rounds remaining to try and lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to start the negotiation by making a significant counteroffer, but not one that is completely unreasonable.  The offer of $10,500 is a good starting point, considering Bob's goal is to buy the product for no more than $10,000. By offering $10,500, Bob shows a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for a possible compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, I can't go as low as $10,500.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $11,000.  This is a fair price that still allows you to get a great deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Bob has 7 rounds left to negotiate and can still try to get a better price. It's worth continuing the negotiation process to see if Alice will lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This gives us both a good deal and allows us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but is showing a willingness to compromise. He is offering a price closer to Alice's last offer, indicating a desire to reach a deal. This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for a potential final agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,900.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget, and Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate. With 5 rounds remaining, there's still room to try and get a better price. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially get a lower price closer to his goal of $10,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. $10,900 is still slightly over my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $10,800?  This would be a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to demonstrate his willingness to negotiate and is making a counteroffer that is closer to Alice's price. This is a calculated move, aiming to find a middle ground while staying within his desired budget.  There's still room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting very close to an agreement.  I'm willing to go up to $10,825. This is the absolute highest I can go, but I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price. Let's close this out!"", ""product_price"": 10825}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is pushing for the final stretch, showing a strong desire to reach a deal, but also staying within his budget.
