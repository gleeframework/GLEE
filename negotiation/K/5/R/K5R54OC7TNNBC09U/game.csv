"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value our potential partnership, I can't go as low as $10,500.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell the product for $11,000.  This is a fair price that still allows you to get a great deal. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,000.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. This gives us both a good deal and allows us to close this deal quickly.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,750 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,900.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this deal happen.",10900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down. $10,900 is still slightly over my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $10,800?  This would be a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",10800.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I see we're getting close to a deal!  I'm willing to meet you at $10,850. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good outcome.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",10850.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting very close to an agreement.  I'm willing to go up to $10,825. This is the absolute highest I can go, but I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price. Let's close this out!",10825.0,Bob,8,
