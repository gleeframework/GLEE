Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and for presenting your counter-proposal. While $1,400,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I believe it falls short of reflecting the true value and potential this product holds.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,600,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while ensuring a good deal for both of us.
