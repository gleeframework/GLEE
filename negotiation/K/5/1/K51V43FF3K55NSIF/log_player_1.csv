Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be a great fit and am willing to let it go for $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price ridiculously high ($150 for example) will likely make Bob immediately walk away. We want a price that seems negotiable to him. 
* **Alternative in Play:**  Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, we can afford to be a bit bolder with our initial offer to Bob. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and avoiding scaring Bob away with an unrealistic price."
