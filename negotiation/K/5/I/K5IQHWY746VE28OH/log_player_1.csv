Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a great deal for you."",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so starting closer to that figure increases earning potential.
* **Leave Negotiation Room:** Offering $13,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (""fair reflection of its worth"") makes the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $8,000.

This strategy balances ambition with the security of a backup plan."
