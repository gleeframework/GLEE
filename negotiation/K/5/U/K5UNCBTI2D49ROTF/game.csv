"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to part with it for $750,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering I'm willing to buy right now.  What do you say?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I have to say that $700,000 is still a bit below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $725,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",725000.0,Alice,3,
