"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset to you.  I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
 
Bob can try to negotiate a better price with Alice. $9,500 is still above his target value, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a reasonable next step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference?  I'll accept $9,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still above Bob's ideal price of $8,000, but it is within his budget of $10,000.  It is also a reasonable compromise, and accepting it would save him $1,000 compared to buying from John."
