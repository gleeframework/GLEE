Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is a decent amount, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer."

I'm running out of time and Bob seems unwilling to budge. I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for $800,000. It's not the ideal outcome, but it's better than risking losing the deal completely."
