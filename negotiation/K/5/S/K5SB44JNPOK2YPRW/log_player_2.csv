Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate its value.  I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're firm on the price, Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $125? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still below my minimum. How about we settle at $135? It's a fair price, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we're getting close. How about $130 and we call it a deal?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  we're getting close! I'm willing to go down to $132, but that's my final offer.  It's a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down significantly and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $132 secures a reasonable deal for you.  Continuing to negotiate for a small potential saving might backfire, leaving you to pay the full $150 to John."
