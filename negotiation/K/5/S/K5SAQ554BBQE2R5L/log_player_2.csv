"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There are still 9 rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his $8,000 limit.  Starting with a $9,000 counteroffer is a reasonable compromise.  This allows some room for negotiation while still showing Alice that Bob is serious about getting a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still above his ideal price. He has 7 rounds remaining to negotiate and still has the option of buying from John. It's worth trying for a lower price, especially since Alice has already shown some willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $9,500. This demonstrates his willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget. It's a middle ground that could be attractive to Alice, especially as she's already lowered her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget, but he wants to save as much as possible.  While $10,500 is close to his ideal price, there are still 5 rounds left to negotiate.  By rejecting the offer, he can continue to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but is also recognizing that Alice is likely to come down only so far. By offering $10,000, he's showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's closer to his ideal $8,000.  With only 4 rounds remaining, there's a need to start closing the gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget, but he wants to save as much as possible.  While $10,250 is closer to his ideal price, there are still 3 rounds left to negotiate.  By rejecting the offer, he can continue to try and get a lower price.  With only a few rounds left, Bob needs to be careful about making a deal that's too high, as it might force him to buy from John at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but is also starting to feel the pressure with only 2 rounds left.  He increases his offer to $10,100, signaling a willingness to compromise while also pushing Alice to meet him halfway.  This is a good middle ground that might convince Alice to close the deal. If she rejects, Bob will likely have to accept her final offer or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round of negotiations with Alice.  Bob has two options:

* **Accept Alice's offer:** This would get him the product for $10,300, which is still within his budget. 
* **Reject Alice's offer:** This would mean buying from John for $8,000. While this is a better price, it means giving up the possibility of a deal with Alice.

Considering that Bob has already rejected several offers, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and leaving him with no choice but to buy from John is high.  Accepting Alice's offer at $10,300 ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids a potentially more expensive outcome."
