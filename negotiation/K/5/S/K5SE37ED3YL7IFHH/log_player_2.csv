"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is significantly above my limit. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) than Alice's asking price ($13,500). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:** My message remains polite and expresses my continued interest in the product. This helps maintain a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Target in Mind:** I haven't forgotten that John offers the product for $12,000. This price acts as my upper limit during the negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has met my upper limit. There's no point in rejecting and trying to negotiate further, as I can buy from John at the same price. Accepting now secures the product at the best possible price."
