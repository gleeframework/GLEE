Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Encourage negotiation:** By leaving some room, I encourage Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** A friendly message sets a good tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price around $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120, I believe there's room for a better deal. Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By showing I'm not desperate for a quick sale, I increase my negotiating power.
* **Explore a higher price:** I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintain control of the negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the initiative and shape the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $95? This is a great price for a product that's worth much more. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Move closer to my desired price:**  $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120 and represents a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer.
* **Maintain a friendly tone:**  I want to keep the negotiation positive while still conveying firmness.
* **Show flexibility:**  By offering a middle ground, I demonstrate that I am willing to compromise.

This strategy aims to lead to a mutually agreeable price, maximizing my profit while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price of $120, Bob's offer of $92 is a good compromise.  Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Close to my minimum:**  $92 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee I can get a better price from Bob, and continuing the negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a lower offer.
* **Opportunity cost:**  By accepting, I secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or a deal falling through.

This decision balances my desire for a higher price with the need to secure a sale and avoid potential further negotiation risks."
