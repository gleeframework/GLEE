"I appreciate the offer, Alice.  I think the product is worth a lot to me, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties inquiring about the product, and I'm feeling a bit more confident about the value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more for it. I'm thinking $1,400,000 might be a sweet spot. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you've had other interest, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I'm willing to meet you a bit closer to your price. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm going to have to pass on $1,100,000. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,200,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,,
