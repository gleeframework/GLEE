Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I've had other interested parties inquiring about the product, and I'm feeling a bit more confident about the value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit more for it. I'm thinking $1,400,000 might be a sweet spot. What do you think?

Reasoning:  While $1,400,000 is better than John's price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. He should continue negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I'm willing to meet you a bit closer to your price. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm going to have to pass on $1,100,000. I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?
