"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her value of the product, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, and I'm definitely interested, but I'm going to have to push back on that price. $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950,000. Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for negotiation. It signals that you're serious about buying the product but you're also looking for a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy having this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John for that price, it makes sense to try and negotiate further with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000.  I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has already rejected your initial counteroffer.  Rather than going back and forth, it makes sense to stand your ground. You're confident $950,000 is a fair price and you're willing to walk away if Alice doesn't come down. This strategy puts pressure on her to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $950,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still above your budget of $1,000,000.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John, it makes sense to take the safe option and buy from him. You've already made a significant effort to negotiate with Alice, and there's no guarantee she'll come down further.  It's time to secure the product at your target price."
