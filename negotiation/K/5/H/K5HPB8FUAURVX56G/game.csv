"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, and I'm definitely interested, but I'm going to have to push back on that price. $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $950,000. Let me know if that's something we can work with.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling this product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy having this product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $950,000.  I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $950,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
