"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to drop my price that drastically this early in the process. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better offer from Bob or potentially accept John's offer later."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  $850,000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,025,000? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win scenario for both of us.  Let's work together to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm confident that with further negotiation, I can get a higher price or ultimately accept John's offer.  I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However,  $900,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000,  which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm feeling very confident that we can close this deal if you're willing to meet me at $925,000.  I truly believe this is a fair price that respects both of our needs.  Let's finalize this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to accept it.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a higher price.  I'm also considering the risk of losing out to John, so I need to carefully weigh my options. However, I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher before considering selling to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 still doesn't cover the value I've placed on this product.  Let's meet in the middle at $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe we're very close to a deal. How about we settle on $937,500? This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to move forward. Let's make this happen! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting close to a deal with Bob, but his offer of $937,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already rejected several of his counteroffers, and I'm starting to run out of rounds.  

Considering the risk of not reaching an agreement with Bob and the certainty of selling to John for a much higher price, it's strategically better to sell to John in this round."
