"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm not quite ready to commit to $900,000. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me.  I believe this price is fair considering the potential we both see in this product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product, but I'm not quite ready to accept $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but it's a bit more in line with your offer.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This price represents a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but it's a bit more in line with your offer.",825000.0,Alice,5,
