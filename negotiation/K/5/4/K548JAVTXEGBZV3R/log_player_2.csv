"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can likely get a better price from Alice. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to invest in this product, but I'm not quite ready to accept $750,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but it's a bit more in line with your offer.

While $850,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than you'd like to pay.  You can likely negotiate further and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This price represents a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This price still reflects the value I place on the product, but it's a bit more in line with your offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down to $825,000. This is a significant savings compared to her initial offer and getting closer to your desired price. Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and going back to her previous price of $850,000 is high.  It's better to accept this offer and save the time and effort of further negotiation."
