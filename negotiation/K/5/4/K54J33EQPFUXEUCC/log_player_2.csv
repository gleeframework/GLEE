"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefit it will bring to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. I think the product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and paying $2,000,000 is too steep.
