"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum ($100) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. I also try to build rapport with a friendly greeting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just a little too low for me. How about $95?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$92.50 is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $92.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $93.75? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it."", ""product_price"": 93.75} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $93.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92.00, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to my minimum, but Bob's offer is still a bit low.  I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially losing out on a better price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, and it's a safer option."
