Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, the goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price might lead to a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,150,000 is:
    * Significantly above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000).
    * Below your guaranteed sale price to John ($1,200,000).
* **Sense of Urgency:** The mention of ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" is a common negotiation tactic to encourage a quicker decision."
