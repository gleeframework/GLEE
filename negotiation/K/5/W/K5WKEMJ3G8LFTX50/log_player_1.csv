Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" you subtly imply the product is worth a significant amount, potentially pushing Bob closer to your asking price.
* **Alternative:** Highlighting that John is waiting in the wings (""before I list it publicly"") creates a sense of urgency and scarcity. This might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters or seems hesitant. You have a strong fallback position with John, giving you leverage in the negotiation."
