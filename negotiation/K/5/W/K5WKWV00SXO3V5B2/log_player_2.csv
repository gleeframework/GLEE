"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay a maximum of $150.  Alice is offering the product for $150. You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John.  There's no advantage to buying from Alice in this scenario."
