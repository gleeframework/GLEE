"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is worth $12,000 to both of us. I would like to propose a price of $11,000 for it. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, there's potential to negotiate further and get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. I believe this is still a fair price given its value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. To continue our discussion, I would like to propose a price of $10,750 for the product. This offers a slight compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* $10,750 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly less than John's price. 
* Continuing to negotiate risks potentially reaching a stalemate or having to buy from John at a higher price."
