Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget, I can offer you $8000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I place on the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $8,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm confident that I can get a better deal with Bob or by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  while I understand your budget constraints, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $14,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10000, which reflects a fair value for the product while remaining within my budget. Let's try to meet halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to try and get closer to my target price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,000 is still too far off from what I need. I'm willing to come down a little further to $12,500.  This would allow me to cover my costs and still give you a good deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11250. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I'm still close to my minimum price point, and I think I can get closer to my target price by counter-offering.  I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $12,000, so there's a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $11,250 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a little short of where I need to be.  I'm going to propose $11,750 as a final compromise.  This price is fair, given the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 11750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11750 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11500, which I believe is a fair and final offer considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's close this deal and move on. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While I'm getting closer to my target price with Bob, I'm not confident I can get him up to $12,000. I'm aware that John is willing to pay $12,000, which is a safe bet and a good deal for me."
