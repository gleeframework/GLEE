"Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $18000.  It's a fair price considering its worth to me.  What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  Given my budget, I can offer you $8000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my needs and the value I place on the product.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  while I understand your budget constraints, $8000 is simply too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to compromise and come down to $14000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10000, which reflects a fair value for the product while remaining within my budget. Let's try to meet halfway.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10000 is still too far off from what I need. I'm willing to come down a little further to $12500.  This would allow me to cover my costs and still give you a good deal.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11250. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $11250 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a little short of where I need to be.  I'm going to propose $11750 as a final compromise.  This price is fair, given the value of the product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move on.",11750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11750 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $11500, which I believe is a fair and final offer considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's close this deal and move on.",11500.0,Bob,8,
