"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits us both.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still allows me some profit while ensuring you get a good deal.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
