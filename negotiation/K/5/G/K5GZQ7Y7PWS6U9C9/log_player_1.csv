"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  Mentioning ""fair price"" attempts to establish a sense of reason and compromise. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  The message ends with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in further discussion. 

This strategy aims to:
* Get Bob to make the first counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest.
* Secure a price closer to my target while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,100,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Necessary:**  While I value Bob's interest, I need to push for a price closer to my target value. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm not ready to give up on getting a better price from Bob. John is a safe backup, but I can potentially earn more through negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* In the next round, I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my ideal, explaining why it's still a good deal for him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This still allows me some profit while ensuring you get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from the previous round, but not drastically.
* **Value Justification:** I'm highlighting that $1,300,000 is still a good deal for Bob, emphasizing profit and value. 
* **Open Ended Question:**  Encouraging Bob to engage and potentially make another counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer keeps the negotiation going, and potentially brings us closer to a mutually acceptable price.
* It also shows Bob that I am serious about getting a good deal, which could lead to him being more willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $1,200,000? That seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 meets my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation is Exhausted:**  While I would prefer to get closer to $1,500,000, it's unlikely Bob will budge further. 
* **Time Constraint:**  Continuing to negotiate risks running out of rounds and losing the opportunity to sell to John. 

**Conclusion:**

* Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and guarantees me the minimum profit I'm seeking. 
* It's a calculated risk, but the potential reward of $1,500,000 from John isn't guaranteed, and the clock is ticking."
