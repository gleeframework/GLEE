"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and $20,000 is significantly more than his target of $15,000.  It makes more sense to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. However, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for potential compromise. It's a reasonable starting point that acknowledges Alice's position while advocating for a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $16,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $18,000 is still higher than Bob's desired price of $15,000.  While it's a step in the right direction, it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if a lower price can be achieved. There are still rounds remaining, and Bob has a strong incentive to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  However, $18,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to pay $17,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $17,000 continues to push for a lower price while still demonstrating a willingness to compromise. It's a reasonable offer that's closer to Alice's counteroffer but still within Bob's budget. This approach shows Bob is serious about buying the product but wants to get the best possible price."
