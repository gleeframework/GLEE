"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000 vs. $1,500,000). This suggests she is willing to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still offering a price lower than what the product is worth to her. While she's moved closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000, but I'd like to propose a slight concession. I'm willing to throw in some additional services and support worth $20,000 to sweeten the deal. This would bring the total value to $1,340,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now below my desired price of $1,350,000, and the added services and support are a significant bonus.  While I could potentially push for a slightly lower price, accepting this offer saves time and ensures a good deal."
