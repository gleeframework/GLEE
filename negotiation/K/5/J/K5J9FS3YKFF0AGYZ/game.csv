"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. Given the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,400,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000. This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000, but I'd like to propose a slight concession. I'm willing to throw in some additional services and support worth $20,000 to sweeten the deal. This would bring the total value to $1,340,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
