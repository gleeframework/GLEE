"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,350,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
