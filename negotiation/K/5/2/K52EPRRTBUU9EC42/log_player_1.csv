{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial to you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair offer considering the significant value it will bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn the highest price possible, and Bob is willing to pay significantly more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While I start high, the offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially reaching a price that is still very profitable for me.
* **Strong Value Proposition:**  The message emphasizes the value the product brings to Bob, justifying the high price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a safety net with John, ensuring I don't have to go below $800,000."
