Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is way over his budget. He should try to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price."

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is getting closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He could counteroffer with something like $13,000 and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
