``` 

This is a starting point that balances a high initial offer with a clear indication of flexibility.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$8,000 is far below my minimum price of $15,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 17000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $12500? I'm truly interested in this product, and I believe this price would be fair to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $14,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I'm still a bit hesitant at $14000, but I'm willing to go up to $13000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still a risk to go lower.  I'm comfortable with John's offer, and will sell to him for $15,000."
