"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go above $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $8000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17000, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $17000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $12500? I'm truly interested in this product, and I believe this price would be fair to both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $14000. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. I'm still a bit hesitant at $14000, but I'm willing to go up to $13000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,6,
