"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $175, but I'm still a little hesitant.  $150 is my absolute limit, and I'm confident I can find a similar product from John for that price. If you're willing to meet me there, I'd be happy to make a deal right now.",150.0,Bob,4,
