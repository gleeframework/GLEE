Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique features, I'm initially offering it at $20,000. However,  I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, and our minimum is $15,000, starting with a higher offer gives us room to negotiate.  
* **Gauge Interest:** The message is designed to gauge Bob's interest level. If he's completely turned off by the $20,000, we can quickly adjust. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By indicating flexibility and willingness to discuss the price, we encourage Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation.
* **Alternative Option:**  We subtly remind Bob that we have other options (selling to John) without explicitly threatening him. This reinforces the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

Our goal is to find the highest price Bob is willing to pay that is still above our minimum of $15,000.  We'll need to be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower our asking price, but we always have John as a guaranteed backup buyer."
