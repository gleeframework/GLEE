"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its unique features, I'm initially offering it at $20,000. However,  I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'll reject Alice's offer. I'm looking to save as much money as I can, and $20,000 is way above my budget of $8,000. I'll see what else is out there.
