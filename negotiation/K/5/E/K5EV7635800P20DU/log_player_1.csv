``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate downwards. It's also a good starting point as it signals I am serious about selling the product to Bob, while leaving room for a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000 to accommodate your needs.  This price still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and agree on $825,000.  This price is within my budget and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. This is a good deal, and I'd rather close the deal with Bob than sell to John for a lower price."
