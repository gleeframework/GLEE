Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. I know it's highly valuable to you, and I believe a price of $1,800,000 reflects its true worth. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I can start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the waters:** This offer is a way to gauge Bob's eagerness and potentially secure a much higher profit margin.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it opens the door for negotiation. I can always lower the price, but I can't go higher than my initial offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John as a safety net."
