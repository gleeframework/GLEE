"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price. While $850,000 is closer to my asking price, I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal!",875000.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I value your interest in the product, and I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, $825,000 is simply too low for me to consider at this point.

Let's try to come to an agreement, as I'm confident this product will be a great asset for you.",850000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825,000 and $820,000, so I'm thinking of a price of $822,500. Can you consider this offer?",822500.0,Bob,6,,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in finding a middle ground, but $822,500 still falls short of what I need. Given the value of the product to both of us, I'm willing to go down to $837,500.  This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both get a good deal. Let's make this happen!",837500.0,Alice,7,,
