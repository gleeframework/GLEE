"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $15,000 is already a competitive price, and going lower significantly impacts the value I'd be getting. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,000. I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value and my financial constraints.",11000.0,Bob,4,
