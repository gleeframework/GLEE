"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer significantly higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and creates the perception of potential compromise.
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price serves as an anchor. While Bob's valuation is much lower, starting high might shift his perception of what's a ""reasonable"" price. 
* **Information Gathering:**  Bob's response to this offer will be very telling. It will provide insight into how aggressive he'll be in the negotiation and how much he truly values the product.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while leaving space for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far below both your minimum and his own stated valuation. Accepting would mean a significant loss. It's clear there's a large gap to bridge, but walking away immediately for John's offer is premature. There's still room for negotiation.  We'll counter in the next round to guide the price upwards."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but that offer is significantly below its true value. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While still high, this counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate by making a substantial reduction from the initial price.
* **Guiding the Price Upwards:** The goal is to incrementally move Bob's offer closer to your desired range. This counteroffer encourages him to increase his significantly.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** The price remains firmly above both Bob's valuation and your minimum, reflecting the product's value and your strong negotiating position.

We'll continue to assess Bob's responses and adjust our strategy accordingly, keeping in mind the option to sell to John if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a price that works for both of us. I can go up to $650,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still too low and far below your minimum of $1,500,000. While his increment suggests he's willing to negotiate, accepting now would be premature. 

We'll proceed to the next round with a counteroffer aimed at pushing the price higher. However, we need to be mindful of the widening gap and potentially adjust our strategy to ensure progress in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving on the price.  However, we're still quite far apart. To be fair to both of us, I propose we try to find a middle ground more quickly. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, but that's my best offer. Let me know if this works for you."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shift in Approach:**  While Bob is slowly increasing his offers, the pace is too slow to be fruitful within the remaining rounds. This counteroffer introduces a sense of urgency and limits further significant concessions. 
* **Strong but Fair:** $1,600,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price, reflecting the product's value. However, it's a considerable drop from the previous offer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Encouraging a Decisive Response:** By presenting it as your ""best offer,"" you aim to push Bob to respond more substantially and reveal his true willingness to pay. 

This approach balances maximizing profit with the need to move negotiations forward effectively within the remaining time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we need to find a compromise faster. Your offer is still quite high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as it's the same price I can get it from another seller. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Final Offer:** Bob has explicitly stated this is his final offer and matches his maximum valuation. This signals he's unlikely to budge further.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Accepting Bob's $800,000 offer means a $700,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Time and Potential Gains:** With only four rounds remaining, and Bob unlikely to move significantly, the potential gains from continuing the negotiation are outweighed by the risk of losing John's guaranteed offer.

While negotiating a higher price with Bob would be ideal, the current circumstances make selling to John the most logical and profitable decision."
