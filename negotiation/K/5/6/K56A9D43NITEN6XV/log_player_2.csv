"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you at a special price, considering your interest in similar items.  Let me know what you think.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay $150 for the product from John, and Alice is offering it at the same price, you have no incentive to accept her offer.  You can always get the product for the same price from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows the possibility of negotiating a lower price with her in the future or finding a better deal elsewhere."
