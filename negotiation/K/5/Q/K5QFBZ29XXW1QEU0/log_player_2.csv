"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000.  I think you'll find it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $12,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in this product but my budget is capped at $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 reflects the product's true value, I understand your budget constraints. Could you meet me halfway at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. Since John is offering the product for $8,000, it's the best option to buy from John and save even more."
