Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $950,000 leaves space for potential negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The message emphasizes the product's value and positions the offer as an opportunity rather than just a sale. This can make Bob more receptive even at a price higher than his initial valuation."
