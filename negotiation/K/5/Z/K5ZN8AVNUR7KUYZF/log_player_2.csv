"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice's initial offer is $110, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum value. 
* **Reasoning:**  A $5 reduction from Alice's offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation.  
* **Message Tone:** The message is polite and emphasizes Bob's interest in the product while establishing a lower price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Bob is trying to get the product for as close to his maximum value ($120) as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $115 is still too high, even though Alice claims it's a compromise. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  There's room for Bob to continue negotiating and get closer to his desired price.

**Next Steps:**

Bob should make a counteroffer again, potentially closer to $110 or $112, depending on how strongly he feels about the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks again for your offer. I appreciate you being flexible.  While I'm closer to your price now, $115 is still a little out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $112? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 112}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob is strategically moving closer to Alice's price but still maintaining a lower price point. 
* **Reasoning:** Offering $112 is a smaller adjustment, signaling that Bob is serious about buying the product. 
* **Message Tone:**  The message remains polite and highlights the ""fair compromise"" aspect."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $117. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** Bob is aiming for a price under $120.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $117 is still above Bob's maximum value of $120. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** There's still room for Bob to counteroffer and see if he can bring Alice down further.  

**Next Steps:**

Bob should make a counteroffer, potentially at $115 or $116,  to see if he can get a better deal before the round limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value the product, $117 is still slightly higher than my budget allows. Would you be willing to go down to $115? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to get a good price for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob is sticking to his goal of staying under $120, while offering a price that's close enough to Alice's last offer to show he's serious.
* **Reasoning:**  $115 is a reasonable counteroffer that bridges the gap between the two previous prices. 
* **Message Tone:**  The message is still polite but emphasizes that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go any lower than $117, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a decent profit from the sale. However, I'm willing to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. If you accept the offer, I'll include a complimentary accessory that adds significant value to the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** While the accessory is a nice gesture, it doesn't change the fact that the price is still above Bob's maximum value of $120. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only three rounds left, there's not enough time to negotiate further and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's Offer:**  John is offering the product at $120, which is Bob's limit.  It's a guaranteed purchase with no risk of further negotiation. 

**Conclusion:**

In this scenario, Bob should buy the product from John.  It's a better option than risking further negotiation with Alice and potentially exceeding his budget."
