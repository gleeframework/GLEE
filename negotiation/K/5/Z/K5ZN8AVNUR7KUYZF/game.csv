,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested, $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you consider $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $115. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for your offer. I appreciate you being flexible.  While I'm closer to your price now, $115 is still a little out of my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $112? It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $117. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",117.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value the product, $117 is still slightly higher than my budget allows. Would you be willing to go down to $115? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to get a good price for it.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any lower than $117, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a decent profit from the sale. However, I'm willing to throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. If you accept the offer, I'll include a complimentary accessory that adds significant value to the product. What do you think?",117.0,Alice,7,
