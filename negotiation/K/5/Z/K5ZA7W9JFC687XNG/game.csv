"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, I'm aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  This would still be a very profitable deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm happy to consider your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant compromise for me. It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,025,000. This is a price that still allows you to benefit from the product while also recognizing its value to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm happy to offer you $987,500. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. What do you say?",987500.0,Bob,6,
