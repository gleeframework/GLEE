"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I value your business, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $135? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $135. Would you be willing to meet me at $128? I'm willing to make a slightly larger compromise, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.",128.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $128 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet halfway between our last offers, at $131. This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",131.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going up to $131. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers again, at $129.50. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",129.5,Bob,6,
