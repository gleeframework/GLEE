"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to start with a price of $950,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering your own valuation, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this point.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This price is closer to my initial offer and allows us both to save some money. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this point.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $885,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",885000.0,Alice,5,
