"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest. He knows the product is worth $80 to him, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to pay a bit more to secure it. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell my product for a loss.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm dropping the price from my initial offer but still maintaining a profit margin. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise. If he rejects this offer, I'll reconsider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my preferred price. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more, especially since I'm approaching the halfway point of the negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering the price again, but I'm still confident I can make a profit. This offer is more in line with the value Bob has placed on the product. It's a good balance between maximizing my profit and potentially losing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum.  At this point, I'm concerned that if I reject his offer, I may not be able to get a better deal from him, and John might be a more appealing option."
