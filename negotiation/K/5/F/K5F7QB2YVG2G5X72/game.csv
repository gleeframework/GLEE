"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be fair to propose a price of $11,000 for this exceptional item. We understand its value to you is $12,000, and we aim to bridge the gap while ensuring both parties are satisfied.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. While we're looking to maximize the value for our products, I understand your position. Let's try to find a middle ground. I am proposing an adjusted price of $10,500 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while offering you a more affordable option than the original price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. Considering our positions, I'd like to suggest a price of $10,250 for the product. This offers a slight increase from my previous proposal while still being more affordable for you compared to the original price. I hope this helps us reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $10,000 even?",10000.0,Bob,6,
