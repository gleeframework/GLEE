Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. While we're looking to maximize the value for our products, I understand your position. Let's try to find a middle ground.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. Considering our positions, I'd like to suggest a price of $10,250 for the product.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{

}
```

We're now getting close to the end of our negotiation window.  This offer represents a significant compromise on our part, as it's our maximum price. It also aligns with Alice's value for the product, increasing the likelihood of her accepting."
