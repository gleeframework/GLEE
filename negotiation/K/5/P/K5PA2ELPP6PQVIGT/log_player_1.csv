Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe holds tremendous value. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,500,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company. Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counter-offer to see if we can reach a more favorable deal before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not comfortable with that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This would give us both a good deal, and I believe it accurately reflects the value of this product.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1400000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1300000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not convinced that $1,300,000 is the best price.  I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to counter-offer again to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price before I have to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. However, I want to be fair and reach an agreement. How about $1,350,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to pay $1350000. I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be within my budget. My final offer is $1250000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $1,250,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I don't believe there's much room for further compromise.  Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal, I'm going to accept John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's a guaranteed sale and avoids the risk of a failed negotiation with Bob."
