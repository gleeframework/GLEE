Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 10000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still allows me to earn a good amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting him halfway from his last offer.  I'm hoping he'll accept, as it's still a good price for him and gets me closer to my goal."
