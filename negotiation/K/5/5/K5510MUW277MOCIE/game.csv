"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  That's still a good deal for you, and it works for my budget.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
