"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much money as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $650,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to find a good deal, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the product's worth while still providing you substantial value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to save as much as possible. Considering your initial offer was $1,300,000 and your latest offer is $1,100,000, I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
