"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal and I believe it's well worth the price. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6500. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $6500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $8500 for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $8500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay a bit more than $8000, but I'm not sure I can go much higher than that. How about $7800?",7800.0,Bob,4,
