"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present you with our flagship product, which I believe could significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its immense value to you, estimated at $15,000, I propose an offer to acquire it for $12,000. This price reflects a strategic compromise, aiming to ensure both parties' satisfaction while maximizing my return on investment. I look forward to your consideration and potential acceptance of this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aiming high to maximize her profit. She's aware you're willing to pay up to $15,000 and is trying to anchor that price in your mind. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a more reasonable deal. This opens the door for further negotiation or for you to consider John's offer."
