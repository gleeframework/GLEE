"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is your maximum budget for the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a good deal for both of us - I get a great product, and you get a sale.  Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
