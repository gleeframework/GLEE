"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,500,000. This is significantly more than Bob is willing to pay.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is your maximum budget for the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.

While $1,400,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his maximum budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will budge further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a good deal for both of us - I get a great product, and you get a sale.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is a compromise that I think we can both live with, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000. While $1,350,000 is a better offer than before, it's still over his budget. It's time to cut his losses and purchase from John to avoid further negotiation and ensure he stays within his budget."
