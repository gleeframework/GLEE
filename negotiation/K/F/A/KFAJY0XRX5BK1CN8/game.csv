"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let's find a middle ground to make this work for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While $2,000,000 represents the high-end of the product's value,  $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer.  How about $1,450,000? That's closer to your price, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
