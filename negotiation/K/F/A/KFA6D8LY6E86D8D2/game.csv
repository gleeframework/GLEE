,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about $10,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to be reasonable, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for this round. This is my final offer before I consider selling to John. Let's finalize this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm confident we can close this deal if we meet in the middle. How about $9,750? This is my final offer before I consider John's offer.",9750.0,Bob,6,
