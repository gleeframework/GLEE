"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your specific needs. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I am extending an exclusive opportunity for you to purchase this product for $950,000. This is a special offer tailored for you, and I believe it represents a great value for the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than John's offer, it's still above Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if a lower price is achievable."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you tailoring it to my needs. However,  $950,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to invest in our product. To better align with your budget while still maintaining the value of our offering, I would like to propose a revised price of $900,000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount compared to the market value and provides substantial savings for you. I hope this proposal meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target of $800,000. Since there are still rounds left, it makes sense to continue negotiating and see if a lower price is possible. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to work with me.  However, $900,000 is still a bit too high.  Considering my budget, I'm comfortable offering $875,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for considering my previous offers, Bob. I understand your financial constraints and I am willing to make a final adjustment to accommodate your budget. I propose a price of $885,000 for the product. This still maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while providing you with a substantial discount.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to Alice's initial offer. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge and he could end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
