Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's common in negotiations to start with a price slightly higher than the perceived value. This gives you room to negotiate down.
* **Confidence:**  Expressing confidence in the value of the product can help Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear you're willing to discuss the price.

**Note:** This is just the starting point. We'll need to see Bob's reaction to determine the best course of action."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below our minimum:** We've stated that the product is worth no less than $800,000 to us.  Accepting $750,000 would be a loss.
* **We have a backup:** We can always sell to John for $800,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest in the product. We can likely negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $750,000 is tempting, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?  This is my absolute bottom line, but I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This strategy shows a willingness to compromise while still protecting our minimum value.
* **Reiterating our value:** Mentioning our ""absolute bottom line"" reinforces the value of the product to us.
* **Positive framing:**  Focus on the value and investment potential, rather than just the price. 

**Note:**  This counteroffer is a strategic move. It's a compromise, but we're not losing money, and we're keeping the negotiation alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to meet you at $800,000, Alice. I think that's still a bit too high. How about we try $725,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $725,000 is still below our minimum value, and we're already down to a point where further negotiation might not be fruitful.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  We have a guaranteed sale with John at $800,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could waste valuable time, and we might not be able to get a better price.

We've already tried to compromise with Bob, but he's not willing to meet us halfway. It's time to cut our losses and move on to a buyer who values the product at its worth."
