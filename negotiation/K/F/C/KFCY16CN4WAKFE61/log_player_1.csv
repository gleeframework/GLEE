Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can come up with a fairer price for both of us. How about $110 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $125? This would still be a good deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth $120 to you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can still reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would $120 be too high for you to consider? That way, I can purchase the product without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal for me. Bob is offering my minimum price, and I'd rather close the deal than risk losing him and having to deal with John."
