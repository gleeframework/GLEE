"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction.  By offering $8,500, he's showing Alice he's serious about a deal but also leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a great product, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you in the long run. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $8,500.  While there might be potential to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting again or Bob having to pay John's higher price makes accepting this offer the most logical choice.  Bob is still saving $1,000 compared to John's price."
