# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $500000 is a significant reduction from my initial price, but I'm still not convinced it's a fair reflection of the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is my final compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

While $1,200,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum limit.  It's a good opportunity to get the product for a significantly lower price from John."
