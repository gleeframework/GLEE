``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than what Bob thinks it's worth, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives him some room to negotiate, while also ensuring I'm not giving away too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'd ideally like to get.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my target.  There's still a chance we can reach a deal that works for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  I think that's fair, and it would allow us to both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $9,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,250 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to try one more counteroffer.  I'm still confident I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,400 as a final offer.  It's a fair price, and I think it reflects the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9400}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $9,400, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $9,200. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to keep negotiating with Bob, $9,200 is still too low for me.  Given that John is willing to pay $12,000, I'm going to go ahead and sell to him.  It's a better deal for me, and I can avoid further negotiation."
