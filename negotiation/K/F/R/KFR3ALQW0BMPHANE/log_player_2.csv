"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $12,000 to us, but considering its value to you, I'd like to propose an initial price of $10,500. This is a special offer tailored just for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my target price of $12,000. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price. I have 10 rounds, so I have time to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but $10,500 is a bit outside my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $9,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to meet somewhere in the middle. To further explore this opportunity, I would like to suggest a price of $10,000 for the product. This still represents a discount compared to our internal valuation, but it's closer to your proposed amount. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still slightly above my target price.  I'm going to continue negotiating to try and get the price down even further. I have several rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that's not ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $10,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for $9,750. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're open to negotiation, Bob. Considering your latest proposal, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial solution. How about we set the product price at $9,875? This is a slight increase from my previous offer and closer to your offer. Let me know if this suggestion is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,875 is close enough to my target price of $9,750. I've already made several counteroffers and it's getting close to the end of the negotiation.  While I'd like to get it down to my target, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product for a price that's still within my budget."
