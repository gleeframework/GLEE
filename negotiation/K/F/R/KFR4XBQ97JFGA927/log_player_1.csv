The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Bob is only offering $1,200,000. I'm not willing to accept that price yet.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and while Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not at a price I'm comfortable with.  I've got a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000, which is closer to my desired value for the product.  I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
