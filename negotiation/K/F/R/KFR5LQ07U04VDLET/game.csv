"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering $11,500 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise considering its value to you and my initial offer of $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still slightly out of my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000.  I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a final counteroffer of $12,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12200.0,Alice,5,
