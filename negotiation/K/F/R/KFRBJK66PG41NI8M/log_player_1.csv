Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  While $9,000 is better than $8,000, I want to try and get closer to the $10,000 I initially offered."

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. However, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This would still be a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you."", ""product_price"": 9500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're still looking for a price closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $9500. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell to him at $8,800, I still have a few rounds left and I want to try and get a price closer to $10,000. It's a risk, but I think I can get a better deal with a counteroffer."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $9200. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $8900 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to what I initially wanted, I still think I can do better.  I have a few rounds left, and I don't want to settle too early.  I'm hoping I can push him up a bit more."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to pay $9100. I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. My final offer is $8900, and I hope you can meet me halfway.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  I've been unable to reach a price that's satisfying for me with Bob.  We're only in round 8, but I'm worried that we'll just keep going back and forth without reaching an agreement.  John is guaranteed to buy for $12,000, and I don't want to risk losing that opportunity."
