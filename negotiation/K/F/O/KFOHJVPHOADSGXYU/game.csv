,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in buying but I'm only able to go up to $120 at this point. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $170? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll find great value in it.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $170 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to that.",140.0,Bob,4,
