Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, taking into account Bob's valuation of the product. It allows for potential negotiation while ensuring a profit for Alice.  It also provides an opening for Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still below Alice's minimum acceptable price. Alice is better off rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate or selling to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This price still allows for a profit for me, and it's closer to your initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $9,800 is closer to Alice's minimum, it's still below her desired profit margin. Selling to John guarantees her a $10,000 profit, which is a better outcome for Alice than accepting Bob's offer.  Further negotiation with Bob carries the risk of a lower offer or a stalemate."
