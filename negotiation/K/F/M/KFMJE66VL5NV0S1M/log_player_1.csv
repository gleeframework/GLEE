I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise."

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for profit. I hope Bob will find this more appealing and we can come to an agreement."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and a significant improvement over selling to John.  It's worth closing the deal now to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection."
