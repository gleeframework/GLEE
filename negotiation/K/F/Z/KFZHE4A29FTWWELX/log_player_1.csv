**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently inching upwards, but very slowly. At this pace, it's unlikely he'll reach a price significantly higher than his current offer. Accepting his offer of $785,000 would leave a potential $15,000 on the table compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's strategically better to cut negotiations and secure the $800,000 from John."
