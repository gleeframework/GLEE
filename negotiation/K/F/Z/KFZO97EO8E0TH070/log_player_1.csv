Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $8,750 is still a bit low for me.  Let's compromise at $8,900.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,900. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, accepting Bob's offer of $8,800 is the best option at this point.  

Here's why:

* **Time is running out:** We're on round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, I don't have much time to negotiate further.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, I risk him walking away entirely.
* **Value to Bob:** Bob clearly values the product at $10,000.  $8,800 is still a good deal for him, and it's likely he'd be willing to pay more in the future to avoid missing out.

While I'm not getting my ideal price, $8,800 is significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.  I need to be realistic and take the best offer available."
