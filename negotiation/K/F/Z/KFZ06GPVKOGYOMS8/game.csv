"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,500? It's still a fair price considering its value.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This still gives you a good price and allows me to earn a fair amount for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750.  Let's close this deal.  This way you can still get a good price for the product, and I can get a good deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  $8,750 is still a bit low for me, but to finalize this deal, I'm willing to meet you at $8,900.  This price is fair for both of us, and it lets us move forward. What do you say?",8900.0,Alice,5,
