I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $13,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.

Reason: Alice has stated this is her final offer.  While closer to my ideal price, it's still above the $12,000 I know I can get it for from John.  There's no point in further negotiation if I won't go above John's price."
