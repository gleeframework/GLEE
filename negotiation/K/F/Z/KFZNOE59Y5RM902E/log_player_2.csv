"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which I think is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and also better than buying from John for $1,500,000. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money."
