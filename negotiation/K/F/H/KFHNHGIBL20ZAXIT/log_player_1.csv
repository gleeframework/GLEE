Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $100, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $100, which is closer to my ideal price but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, which could make him more willing to pay a higher price.
* **Open-ended question:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts, which encourages a dialogue and gives him a chance to counter. 

This strategy balances my desire to maximize profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $100 is a bit high for my budget. How about $85? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $85 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, especially since he's already shown interest.
* **Counteroffer potential:** I can counter with a price closer to $90, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is a fair compromise considering the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to his price.
* **Highlight value again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to reinforce the reason for a higher price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation positive to encourage continued negotiation.

By counteroffering at $95, I'm aiming for a price that's both profitable for me and potentially acceptable to Bob, giving us a good chance of reaching a deal."
