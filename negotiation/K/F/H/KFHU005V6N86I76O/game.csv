"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $15000.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11500 is still a little higher than I'm aiming for. Given its value to me, I'm confident that $11000 is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $12200. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's value to me.",12200.0,Alice,5,
