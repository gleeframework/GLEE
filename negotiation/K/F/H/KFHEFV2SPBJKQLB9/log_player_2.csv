"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe you would be very interested in. It's something that I know you value highly, and I'm confident it would be a great asset for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While the offer of $11,500 is higher than Alice's value, it's still less than your maximum of $12,000 and the price John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John."
