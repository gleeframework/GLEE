"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price from Alice. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. Offering $9,000 is a good starting point for negotiation. It's lower than Alice's offer but still above her minimum acceptable price. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while also leaving room for further concessions if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still within Bob's budget of $12,000, and it's a better deal than buying from John.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $2,500 compared to John. While further negotiation might be possible, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and ultimately having to buy from John for $12,000 outweighs the potential savings."
