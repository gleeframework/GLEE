# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think you'll love it! I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you offering the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is around $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I also have to consider my own value for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $16,000 for it. Can we discuss a price of $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $16,000 is better than $18,000, it's still above my budget. I have 7 rounds left to negotiate, so I'm going to continue trying to get the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still higher than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which would be a good deal for both of us. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $14,000 for the product. Can we meet at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer, $14,000 is still above my budget. I have 5 rounds left, and I'm determined to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you need to get a good price, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this point."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not ready to give up yet! I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Can we do business at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, with only 3 rounds left, it's getting more risky. I'm concerned we might not reach an agreement, and I don't want to lose out on the product. Buying from John at $10,000 guarantees I get the product within my budget."
