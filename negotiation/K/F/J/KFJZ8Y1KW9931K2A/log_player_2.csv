"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe its value far exceeds the asking price. Are you interested in discussing a purchase at $1,450,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy to achieve his goal."
