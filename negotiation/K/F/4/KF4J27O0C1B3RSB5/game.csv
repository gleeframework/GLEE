"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to you and my need to get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,050,000?  This price reflects the value you'll receive from the product and allows me to recoup a reasonable portion of my investment. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,050,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $975,000 is still too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers. How about $1,012,500?  This price allows me to achieve a reasonable return while still being within your budget. I'm confident that the product will provide significant value to your business.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me and finding a compromise. While $1,012,500 is a fair offer, I'm afraid my absolute limit is $990,000. If you're unable to accept this, I completely understand, but I wouldn't want to waste your time with further negotiation.",990000.0,Bob,6,
