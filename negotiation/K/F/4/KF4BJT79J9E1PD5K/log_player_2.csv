(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$600,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get it for much less.  Rejecting allows me to start negotiating and see how motivated Alice is to sell."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer to gauge Alice's reaction.  It's unlikely she'll accept this, but it establishes a strong negotiating position and lets me see how much she's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $450,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still too high. I'm going to keep pushing for a lower price, seeing how far I can get Alice to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 375000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about buying but still staying well below Alice's current offer. This keeps the pressure on her to lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $425,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$425,000 is getting closer to my ideal price, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject and continue pushing for a lower price. I have plenty of rounds left and don't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but only slightly. This shows Alice I'm getting closer to her price while still maintaining a firm position. I'm confident I can close the deal at or below $400,000, so I'm staying patient and seeing if she'll budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is back up to $450,000, which is higher than my last counteroffer.  While I'm getting closer to her desired price, I'm not willing to settle yet.  I have a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 410000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems to be sticking to her price, but I'm still pushing for a lower amount. This counteroffer is a compromise between my last offer and hers, demonstrating my willingness to meet halfway. Hopefully, this encourages her to accept and close the deal. If she rejects, I still have a few rounds to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $430,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $430,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Alice's best offer so far, and I only have one round left. While I'd prefer to pay closer to $400,000, it's risky to reject and potentially end up buying from John for $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product for a significant discount compared to John's price."
