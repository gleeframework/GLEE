"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** It's common to start with a higher price in negotiations, especially when you know your minimum value.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  A $100 price allows for some potential back-and-forth without going below my minimum of $120.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive tone can encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value threshold:**  $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob's counteroffer shows interest, so there's potential to reach a higher price with further negotiation. 
* **Avoiding John:** While selling to John guarantees $120, I want to see if I can get closer to that amount with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about $95?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** This counteroffer demonstrates willingness to negotiate while remaining above my minimum.
* **Justifying the price:**  Highlighting the value of the product provides a reason for the price and encourages Bob to consider it.
* **Finding middle ground:**  $95 is a potential midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $90.  I'm sure we can both be happy with that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **High chance of John:** While I want to explore getting closer to $120, there's a good chance John is a better option. 
* **No more room for counteroffers:** If I reject this offer, I'm left with only a few rounds before needing to decide on John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go any lower than $92. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the closest I can come to meeting you halfway. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  $92 is a small step closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Last Chance:**  This is likely my last opportunity to increase the price before needing to consider selling to John.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price."
