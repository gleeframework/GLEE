"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85? I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about $95?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's split the difference and go with $90.  I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go any lower than $92. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the closest I can come to meeting you halfway. Let's make this deal happen.",92.0,Alice,5,
