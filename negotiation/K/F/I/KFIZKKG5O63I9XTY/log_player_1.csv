Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're aiming for a higher price than your minimum of $800,000. 
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he has room to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This offer allows for potential back-and-forth to reach a mutually agreeable price.

**Reasoning:**  Offering a lower price than Bob's perceived value will increase the chances of him accepting. By offering a price closer to your minimum, you also reduce your potential profit. This offer strikes a balance between maximizing your profit and getting Bob to accept the offer."
