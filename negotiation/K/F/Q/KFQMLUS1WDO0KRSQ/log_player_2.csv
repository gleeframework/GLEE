Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,750 is still a bit higher than your target, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $11,250, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see that you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, so I can only go as low as $11,500. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear that Alice is sticking very close to her initial offer and is unlikely to move significantly.  At this point, it's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a price even closer to John's offer. It's more strategic to secure the product from John at a guaranteed $12,000."
