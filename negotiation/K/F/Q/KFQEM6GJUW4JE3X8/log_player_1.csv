Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."",
 ""product_price"": 115
}
``` 
Reasoning:  I start with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value. This gives me a good chance of securing a deal quickly and for a price close to the maximum Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reasoning: While I could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $110 is a safe and profitable choice. It exceeds my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or Bob walking away."
