Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's below Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum acceptable price.  This leaves room for negotiation, but it's a strong initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's above my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to settle for his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Although it's just slightly above John's offer, the risk of continuing to negotiate is high. There's a chance Bob might reject my counteroffer and I might end up with John's offer, which is my minimum acceptable price. By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a slightly higher price with less risk."
