Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly remind Bob of its worth, justifying the higher price.
* **Limited Time Offer:**  By framing it as a pre-public listing offer, you create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important:** While John offers a safety net at $12,000, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a more profitable outcome."
