"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum. This product has considerable value, and I'm confident it will bring you a significant return. How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I still think $1,700,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
