"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really appreciate its unique features and benefits. Would you like to buy it from me for $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $17,000 is significantly higher than both your $10,000 limit and John's $10,000 offer.  It makes the most sense to go with John."
