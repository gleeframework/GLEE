(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  $12,000 is still too high compared to your maximum budget and Alice's valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than her valuation. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth continuing to negotiate, but I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but it's still well below her last offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still too high, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'm going to make one last counteroffer to see if we can reach a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to $11,000.  This is a significant compromise, but hopefully, Alice will be willing to accept it, as it's still well below her last offer and closer to her valuation.  I'm running out of time and this is my last chance to make a deal with her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is too high, and I'm running out of time. I'm not willing to go higher, so I'm going to buy the product from John.  While it's not the ideal price, it's still within my budget and ensures I get the product."
