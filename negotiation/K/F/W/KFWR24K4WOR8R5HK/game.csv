"Bob, I understand you value the product highly. While $9000 is a good starting point,  I'm still a bit far from where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $10500. This gives us both a fair deal. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
