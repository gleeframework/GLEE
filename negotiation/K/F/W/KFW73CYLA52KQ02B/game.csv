"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $775,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.

"Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $725,000.
