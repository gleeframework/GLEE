"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  I believe it holds immense value, and while my minimum price is quite high, I'd like to start the conversation at $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to go as high as $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price, but $850,000 is a significant gap from where I value this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value you'll be gaining.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. Let's find a middle ground. ",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground: how about $1,150,000? This offer takes into account the value you see while acknowledging the significant worth this product holds.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. How about $1,000,000? This feels like a fair middle ground that recognizes the value of the product for both of us. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,
