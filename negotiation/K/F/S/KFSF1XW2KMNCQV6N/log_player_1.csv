{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's a great value for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to Bob.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price closer to my desired value, I create an incentive for Bob to counteroffer. This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a higher final price.  If Bob rejects my offer, I'll be ready to counter with a lower price, but still aiming for a final price above $10,000.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob become too drawn out or unsuccessful."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do it for $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far too low for me.  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even below what the product is worth to him ($8,000).  I'm not willing to sell it for that price.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a compromise.  I'll keep John's offer as a backup if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $9,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $9,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still a good price for me.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer, but firmly stating my own position. I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob while maintaining my negotiating stance.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering with a more reasonable price, I aim to keep the negotiation alive while still ensuring a profitable outcome for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and come closer to my desired price. If not, I'm prepared to counteroffer again or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Selling for that price wouldn't be a fair deal for me.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer again, aiming for a price that's more in line with what I consider a fair value for the product. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup if these negotiations continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $7,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm open to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? This would give us both a fair price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $8,500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a price that is above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal and expressing my willingness to compromise while maintaining a firm position on my own bottom line. 

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering with a price that is closer to Bob's last offer, I aim to keep the negotiation moving forward while still safeguarding my desired profit margin. If Bob accepts, I get a good deal. If he rejects, I can continue to negotiate or move on to John's offer."
