Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I've got a great product for you that I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum value of $120.
* **Is below Bob's maximum:** You're giving Bob room to negotiate while still giving you a good profit margin. 
* **Is a clear and concise message:** It directly states the price and invites Bob to respond. 

By starting with a slightly lower price, you encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation and potentially increase the final sale price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is above your absolute minimum of $120, it's a significant drop from your initial offer and leaves less room for profit. By rejecting this offer, you can maintain your negotiating position and explore a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $125?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $122.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $122.50 is only slightly above your minimum of $120, it's a reasonable compromise and a good deal considering Bob's initial offer of $110. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and allows you to secure a slightly higher price than selling to John."
