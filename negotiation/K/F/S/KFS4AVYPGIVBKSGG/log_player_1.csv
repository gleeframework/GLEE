Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and optimistic message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  Highlighting the product's value might make Bob more willing to pay a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price allows for back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* I'll be mindful of the time spent negotiating, as I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I am willing to pay $13,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my desired $14,000 or even higher.
* **Time Factor:**  It's important to weigh the time spent negotiating against the potential for a better price. I'm willing to invest some time to see if I can secure a more favorable deal.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price closer to my target.  
* I will closely monitor the negotiation to avoid spending too much time, as I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly higher price to reflect the true value of the product. How about $13,500?  It's a fair price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm raising the price slightly to $13,500, which is closer to my desired price of $14,000.
* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly and professional tone to encourage continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his next counteroffer and adjust my strategy based on his proposed price and my time constraints.
* If I feel the negotiation is becoming too time-consuming or if Bob's offers are consistently too low, I'll sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. I am still committed to finding a price that works for both of us. I would like to offer $13,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob's counteroffer is the same as his previous offer. This indicates that we've reached a stalemate, and further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a significant price increase.
* **Time Factor:**  While I'm still aiming for a higher price, the time spent negotiating is starting to outweigh the potential gains. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $15,000 provides a guaranteed profit and avoids further delays.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll contact John and finalize the sale. 
* Although I'm disappointed that I couldn't secure a higher price from Bob, selling to John ensures a good return on my product."
