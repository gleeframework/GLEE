"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer $1400000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to consider the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let's try $1600000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $1600000 is closer, I'm still not there yet.  Let's split the difference and go with $1500000.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to move forward with another seller at that price.",1500000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're close to making a decision, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of $1650000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one last time.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
