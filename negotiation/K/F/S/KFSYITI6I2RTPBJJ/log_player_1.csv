This offer starts with a reasonable price that's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. The message is friendly and inviting, hoping to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

While Bob's offer is your minimum, there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate your interest, $150 is a bit too low for me at this point.  How about we split the difference and go with $175? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure I can get him any higher.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
