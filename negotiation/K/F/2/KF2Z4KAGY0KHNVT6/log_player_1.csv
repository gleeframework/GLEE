Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $110, which I believe is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, starting at $110 leaves some space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, but there's a good chance he'll accept to avoid losing out on the $120 value. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
