"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time. This is my best price, let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $1000000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to own something truly unique. Let me know if you're interested!",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're not able to accept that price, I'll have to look at other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
