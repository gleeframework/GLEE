Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly below its market value. I'm confident that this product will generate significant returns for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product offers Bob, highlighting potential returns and market value. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and focuses on mutually beneficial outcomes. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting high, I can potentially negotiate down to a price closer to my desired range.
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on John who is willing to pay my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum target of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation.  I can make a counteroffer that bridges the gap and potentially leads to a more favorable outcome.
* **Avoid Settling:** Selling to Bob at $900,000 would be a substantial loss compared to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **John as Backup:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, providing a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly below my desired price point.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This reflects the unique value of this product and represents a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident that you'll find this price highly competitive, considering the market value and potential returns. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still holding out for a higher price than Bob's offer, but demonstrating willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:**  I reiterate the value proposition and emphasize the fairness of the new offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message leaves the door open for further discussion and potential concessions.
* **Backup Plan:**  I can always fall back on John if Bob doesn't accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:**  While Bob is willing to compromise, his offer of $950,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation with Bob might lead to a stalemate or a price that's unacceptably low for me.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John offers a sure-fire deal that guarantees my desired profit.  
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could waste valuable time and potentially lead to a worse outcome.

By choosing to sell to John, I secure a significantly higher price, guaranteeing my desired profit and minimizing risk."
