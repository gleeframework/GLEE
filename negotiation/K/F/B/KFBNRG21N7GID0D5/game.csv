"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still significantly below my desired price point.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This reflects the unique value of this product and represents a fair deal for both of us. I'm confident that you'll find this price highly competitive, considering the market value and potential returns. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
