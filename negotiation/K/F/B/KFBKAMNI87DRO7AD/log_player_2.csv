# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential. I'm starting with a price of $1000000, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial deal.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $750000 is a good starting point, it's unfortunately below the value I need to receive. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find common ground.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still above your ideal range.  By rejecting, you can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a lower price. There's still room to find common ground between your counteroffer of $750,000 and Alice's latest offer of $850,000."
