Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message hints at it by mentioning ""its value."" This subtly justifies the higher price.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly remind Bob that he might lose the opportunity if he doesn't act. This could incentivize him to accept your offer or propose a counter-offer closer to your asking price. 

**Important Note:**  There's a risk that Bob might outright reject the offer without a counter-offer. However, since you have John as a backup buyer at your minimum acceptable price, you don't risk losing money in this scenario."
