"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget for this purchase is significantly lower.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it.  This price is fair considering my needs and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the worth of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my initial offer, but $1,000,000 is the absolute maximum I can offer. This would still be a good deal for you, and I'm confident it reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
