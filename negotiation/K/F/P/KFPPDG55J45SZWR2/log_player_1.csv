""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John provides a safety net ($800,000),  Alice can be more ambitious with Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 leaves a potential $100,000 profit for Bob, incentivizing him while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Confident Messaging:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob specifically, justifying the high price."
