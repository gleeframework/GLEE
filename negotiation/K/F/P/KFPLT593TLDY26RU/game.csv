"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we begin our negotiation, I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiating and finding a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While $1,200,000 is a tempting price, I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This offer reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to save as much as possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your willingness to save and the product's actual worth. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
