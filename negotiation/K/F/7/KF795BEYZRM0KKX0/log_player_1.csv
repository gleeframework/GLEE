"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know will be incredibly valuable to your business. I'm confident it will generate a significant return on investment. My initial offer is $1,000,000. This reflects the product's true potential and allows for a healthy margin for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more fair agreement. How about we aim for $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than the value I know the product holds for him ($1,200,000). I have 8 more rounds to negotiate and a fallback option with John, so I can afford to push for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still not there yet.  $850,000 doesn't fully reflect the product's potential for your company.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to go down to $925,000. This price is fair and allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I think we're getting closer. How about we aim for $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my desired price point. While I'd prefer more, I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer entirely.  I have a good chance of securing a sale and I can still make a profit significantly higher than selling to John."
