"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm not sure I can go that high right now. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for the product. It's a good price for both of us and allows us to make a deal.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I'm looking to get out of it. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want to get a fair price, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $13000?  It's a reasonable compromise that gets us closer to a deal. Let me know if that works for you.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $13500. It's a slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13500.0,Alice,5,
