"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $10,500, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I understand you're trying to get a better price, I'm still firm on my offer of $10,500.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on to another seller.",10500.0,Bob,6,
