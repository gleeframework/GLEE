Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and hopefully gets Bob thinking about the product's value to him. I've also included a message that makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $125 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum price of $150.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $135.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150.  While Bob's offer of $135 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. John is offering my minimum, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob, which could potentially lead to a lower offer or a prolonged negotiation process.  It's best to take the guaranteed $150 from John."
