"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $15000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $17500 for the product. This would give you a great deal, and it's a fair compromise.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $16000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,
