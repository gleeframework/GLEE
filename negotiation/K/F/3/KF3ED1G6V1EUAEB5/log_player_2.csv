"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,500. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth at least $10,000 to you. If you decline, I'll be selling it to John for that amount. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

You are better off rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $10,000.  While Alice is trying to get a bit more, you can get the product at your maximum price point with John."
