Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** Bob is willing to pay more, so there's room for negotiation. 
* **It leaves room for potential compromise:**  If Bob rejects this offer, it opens the door for further negotiation without you needing to immediately drop to John's price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the initial offer I made to Bob. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price. By rejecting this offer, I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It's lower than my initial offer:** This shows flexibility and willingness to meet halfway.
* **It's still above my minimum:** I'm not losing money on this deal.

This counteroffer puts the pressure on Bob to either accept and finalize the deal or make another counteroffer closer to my desired price."
