"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is a decent price, you can likely do better.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  Offering $100 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, making it a reasonable starting point. You're aiming for a price that is fair to both parties and allows for potential further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $115, which is still a good deal for you.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer again, and you might end up having to buy from John for $150.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product for a price that's within your budget."
