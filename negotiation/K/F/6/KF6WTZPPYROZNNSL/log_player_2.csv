"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a limited time. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if I can get it for even less. There are 9 rounds left, which gives me room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  While I'm very interested, I'm only able to spend $80 at this time.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at 80. How about we meet in the middle at 85? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price.  $85 is within my budget and a good compromise. There is no guarantee that further negotiation will get me a lower price, and I risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
