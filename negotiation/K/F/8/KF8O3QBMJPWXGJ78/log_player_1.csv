Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $80.
* **My Minimum:** I need to make at least $150.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $150.

Since I know John will buy the product for $150, I need to try and get more than that from Bob.  By offering the product at $140, there's a chance Bob might find it a good deal (even if it's slightly above his valuation) and I'll make a profit.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
