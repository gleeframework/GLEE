"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but not so high that it seems ridiculous. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to make the offer more appealing. 
* **Setting a positive tone:** I'm using positive language and encouraging Bob to make a deal.

**Remember:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 at any time if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob's offer is a fair price from his perspective, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I have 9 rounds left to negotiate a better price. There's potential for Bob to increase his offer, and I can use the remaining rounds to find a price that benefits both of us. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer. 

**Next steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.  Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his offer. This shows I am willing to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Maintaining leverage:** The price is still higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my desired price. This allows for further negotiation without losing too much ground.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the benefits of the deal for Bob and expressing my willingness to find a mutually beneficial solution. 

**Remember:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000, which gives me a strong bargaining position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and is the absolute maximum I can pay. Let's work together to find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below the minimum:**  While Bob's offer is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Room for negotiation:** I have six rounds remaining. There is still potential for Bob to increase his offer, and I can use these rounds to push for a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 remains a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I will continue to emphasize the product's value to Bob and the potential benefits of a deal for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,100,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it for $1,200,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate:** I'm continuing to move closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go to $1,150,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below the target:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired minimum of $1,500,000.  Accepting it would mean a substantial loss for me. 
* **Negotiation window is narrowing:** We have only four rounds remaining.  There's a risk that we may not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer is a safe haven:** I have a strong backup option with John, who is willing to pay my desired price. 

**Next steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to push the price higher. I will continue to emphasize the value of the product to Bob and the benefits of closing a deal. I will also consider how much I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done."
