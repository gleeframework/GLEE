"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's try to make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
