"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $14000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. How about we meet in the middle at $10500? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is better than her initial offer, it's still above your budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still more than I can comfortably afford. How about we split the difference at $9,250? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $9250. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $9250, which would be $9875. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,875 is still above your budget. While you could continue to negotiate, it's likely that the negotiation will be drawn out, and you may not be able to get to a price you're comfortable with. Buying from John for $8,000 guarantees you get the product at your desired price point."
