"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in.  Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my interest in your product. I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent offer, it's below my minimum threshold of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little from my initial offer. I'm proposing $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I would like to propose $10,000 as the price for the product. This is the maximum amount I am willing to spend, and I believe it's a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 meets my minimum price threshold, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.  It would be unwise to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal with Bob.  While selling to John would be a safe option, securing a deal with Bob for the same price ensures I don't lose out on potential future business opportunities."
