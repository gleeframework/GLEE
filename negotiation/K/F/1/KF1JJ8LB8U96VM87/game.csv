"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential in this product,  $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to offer you $750000 for it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $825000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $825000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
