"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I know it holds significant value for you, and I believe a price of $950,000 reflects its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with an ambitious offer close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Gauge Bob's Response:** This initial offer helps us understand Bob's negotiating style and how eager he is to acquire the product. His reaction will guide our strategy in subsequent rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** We are aware that John offers a safe alternative at $800,000. This knowledge provides a safety net, allowing us to negotiate confidently with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, we have room to negotiate and aim for a higher price.  Here's why:

* **Above our Minimum:**  Even if negotiations fail, we can sell to John for $800,000.  
* **Early Stages:** It's only round 2. We have time to counter and gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to our desired price point. 

We'll provide a counteroffer in the next round that meets Bob somewhere in the middle while still exceeding our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This recognizes the product's true value while acknowledging your willingness to make a deal."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise by suggesting the midpoint between Bob's last offer ($850,000) and our previous ask ($950,000). 
* **Firm but Fair:** The tone remains collaborative, emphasizing finding common ground while subtly reminding Bob of the product's value.  
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps us well above our minimum ($800,000) and allows for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my target price. I'm prepared to offer $875,000.  This price reflects a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to both of us. I'm confident we can close the deal at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  Bob's offer of $875,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and is quite close to our desired range.
* **Time Value:** While we might be able to negotiate a slightly higher price, the difference is likely to be small. Accepting now secures a substantial profit and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation reaching an impasse. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. Each round spent on Bob is a round we don't spend pursuing other opportunities or deals.

Overall, accepting $875,000 represents a favorable outcome, exceeding our minimum price and rewarding our negotiation efforts."
