"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is under your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. Alice is still making a profit even if you negotiate the price down. Rejecting her offer opens the door for further negotiation."
