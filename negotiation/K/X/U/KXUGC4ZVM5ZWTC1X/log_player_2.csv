```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm around $10,200, and even though she states it's her ""final offer,""  there's little incentive to believe she won't negotiate further if you reject. However, you have a guaranteed option with John for $10,000.  At this point, the potential savings of a few hundred dollars by continuing with Alice are outweighed by the risk of the negotiation failing. It makes more sense to take the sure thing with John."
