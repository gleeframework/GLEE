Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'm still within my 10 round limit, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

While $9,800 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with selling for less than $10,000. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to budge a little more."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  Bob and I have gone back and forth a few times, but it seems like we're at an impasse. I'm not comfortable dropping below $10,000, and Bob is unwilling to go higher.  While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, it's important to me to get as close to my desired price point as possible. John's offer of $12,000 is significantly better, and it's time to move on."
