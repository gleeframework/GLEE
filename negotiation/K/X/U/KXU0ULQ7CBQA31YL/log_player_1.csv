I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This is a high starting point, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping to get as much as possible, but I'm also aware that I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I think I can still get more. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to meet in the middle and secure a sale that is still beneficial to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation that could lead to him backing out completely.  $1,850,000 is a good price, and I'm happy to take it."
