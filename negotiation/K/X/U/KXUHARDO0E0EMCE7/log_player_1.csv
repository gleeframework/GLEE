"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be very interested in it. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $13,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $12,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for compromise.  I'm also framing it as a good deal for Bob, emphasizing the value he'll receive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm confident I can get a better price. I will counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,750 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle for $11,250? That's closer to your offer and still allows me to get a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  I could do $11,000.  That's a really strong offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise, and it's closer to my desired price point. While I'd like to get more, it's getting late in the negotiation and I'm running out of rounds. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing out on the sale entirely."
