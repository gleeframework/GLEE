"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I believe a higher starting price will encourage Bob to engage in negotiations, and we can work towards a mutually agreeable figure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe we can still achieve a better outcome.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with my own, aiming to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $975,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for negotiation.  I believe this will demonstrate my willingness to reach a deal while still preserving a good price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hopeful to achieve a better deal. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with my own. I think we can still find a price that is fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $950,000.  This is a compromise that meets Bob halfway. We've both moved closer to a potential deal. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to Bob and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than I'd prefer, we're running out of rounds. I think it's time to close the deal, even if it's slightly below my ideal price. $920,000 is significantly better than my fallback option of selling to John for $800,000."
