"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, $1,450,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value we both see in the product. Let's find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal.  What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming down to $1,325,000. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise that allows us both to close this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still not quite meeting my needs. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, but that's my absolute lowest. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're able to accept.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
