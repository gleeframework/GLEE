"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, $1,450,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob or, if negotiations fail, I can always sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still within a reasonable range for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise on my part. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value we both see in the product. Let's find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'm going to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob in the next round.  I have a few rounds left and can always sell to John if necessary."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,300,000 is still a bit below my desired price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to get a fair deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, and I appreciate you coming down to $1,325,000. I'm willing to offer $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise that allows us both to close this deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can close the deal at a more favorable price. If not, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
