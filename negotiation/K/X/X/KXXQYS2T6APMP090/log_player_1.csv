Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is still a good deal for Bob as it's $2,000 below his perceived value.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob and using positive language to encourage acceptance.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation if Bob counteroffers.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: Great! I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make a counter-counteroffer, or move on to John to secure the guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's also only $500 more than what the product is worth to him, so he's not demonstrating a willingness to pay a fair price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** While I could accept his offer and get something, it's not worth the risk. Selling to John guarantees me $12,000, which is a much better outcome.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting his offer shows him I'm serious about my asking price and allows me to make a counteroffer that may be more attractive to him.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **John is the Backup:** If Bob continues to be unreasonable or the negotiation drags on, I'll move on to John and sell him the product for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product.  It's still a great price for you considering its value, and I'm confident you won't regret it.  Let's find a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price from $10,000 to $9,500. This demonstrates flexibility while still protecting my interests.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using optimistic language to encourage Bob to see the value in my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accepting Bob's Offer:** If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I'll sell the product for $9,500.
* **Further Negotiation:** If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer. I'll need to determine if it's closer to my minimum acceptable price or if it's time to move on to John. 
* **John is the Backup:** If the negotiations with Bob stall or become too frustrating, I'll go with the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8800? It's the highest I can go, but I really like the product and think it's worth it to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While $8,800 is only $200 below my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low for me.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The negotiations with Bob have been going on for a while, and I'm getting the sense that he's not going to budge much further.
* **Guaranteed Value:**  John is offering a guaranteed $12,000, which is significantly more than what I would get from Bob even if I successfully negotiated a higher price.
* **Time is Money:**  It's not worth it to continue haggling with Bob when I have a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my asking price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Selling to John:** I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000 to maximize my profit and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
