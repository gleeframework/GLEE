"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $105? That's the lowest I can go.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $110 as a final offer.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",110.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but I'm really close to my budget. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll take the deal.",105.0,Bob,6,
