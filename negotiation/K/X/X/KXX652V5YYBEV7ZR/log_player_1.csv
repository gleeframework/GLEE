{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is strategic for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Offering $14,000 gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** This ensures you're still getting a profit, and gives you some wiggle room for counteroffers.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects the offer, it's likely he'll counter with a lower price, giving you a chance to meet in the middle.

By starting with this offer, you set the stage for a successful negotiation without immediately jeopardizing your goal of earning as much as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I want for the product. I can't afford to lose out on $4,000, especially since I know John is willing to pay my minimum.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer is higher than Bob's but lower than my initial offer:** This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive language and emphasis on value:**  This keeps the negotiation amicable and reminds Bob of the product's worth.
* **Clear next step:**  The message indicates that I'm open to further discussion and seeking a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. I'm trying to stay within my budget, and I think this price is more reasonable for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still $3,500 less than what I'm aiming for.  I'm not ready to give up that much profit, and I believe I can still get closer to my goal. 

I'll reject this offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise that works for both of us.  If that fails, I'll go with my backup plan and sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,250. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.  If you're still interested, let's close this deal.  I'm confident you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final compromise:** This offer represents a significant compromise from my initial position, but it's still above my minimum and  leaves room for a successful negotiation.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:**  I'm highlighting the fairness and value of the offer, emphasizing that it's beneficial for both of us.
* **Clear call to action:**  I'm urging Bob to make a decision and close the deal, creating a sense of urgency.

This counteroffer is my final attempt to reach an agreement with Bob. If he rejects it, I'll move on to my backup plan and sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. This is the maximum I'm willing to spend, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 is only $2,000 above my minimum. While it's a decent offer, it's still a significant loss compared to selling to John for $15,000.  My goal is to maximize profit, and  John offers a much more profitable deal.  

I've exhausted my options with Bob and  I'm not willing to compromise further. It's time to move on to the more lucrative option."
