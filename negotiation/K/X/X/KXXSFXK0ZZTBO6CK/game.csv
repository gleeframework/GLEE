"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value for it and my budget. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  I'm proposing $1,050,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
