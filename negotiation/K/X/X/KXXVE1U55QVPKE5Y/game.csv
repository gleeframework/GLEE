"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price point is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the considerable value it will bring you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $900,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying.  Would you consider $750,000? That's a significant investment on my part and reflects a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $875,000.  This feels like a fair compromise considering the potential return on investment this product offers you.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. However, there's still a gap between our positions. My best and final offer is $800,000. This is a very serious offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. ",800000.0,Bob,6,
