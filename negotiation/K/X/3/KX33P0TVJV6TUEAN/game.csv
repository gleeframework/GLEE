"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to the price of $1,800,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,400,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I'm confident that this product's unique value justifies a higher price point.  I'd be willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000.  This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,650,000.
