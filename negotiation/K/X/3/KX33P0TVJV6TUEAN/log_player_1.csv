Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to the price of $1,800,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While $1,400,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming higher. I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,400,000 is certainly a respectable figure, I'm confident that this product's unique value justifies a higher price point.  I'd be willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000.  This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns about the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,650,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market demand and the product's features. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob is moving closer to my range, but I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll counter again."

{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product holds.  I respect your approach to this negotiation.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,575,000?  I believe that's a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth while addressing your budget considerations."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,575,000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,450,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market demand and the product's features. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}

While I believe the product is worth more, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,450,000 is a good outcome at this stage of the negotiation."
