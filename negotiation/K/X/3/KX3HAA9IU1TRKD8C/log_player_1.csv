I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum desired price of $15,000, but it still leaves me with a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a price closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves me with a reasonable profit while potentially making Bob more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure I get my desired price."
