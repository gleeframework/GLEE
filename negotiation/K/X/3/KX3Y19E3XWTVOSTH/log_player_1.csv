"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me.  This will give me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I also want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me.  While it's tempting to take $6,500, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway by offering $8,500. This is still above my minimum price but shows I'm willing to be flexible.  It's a reasonable compromise that might encourage Bob to come back with a better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum price, it's still too low. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm going to stick with my minimum price of $8,000.  Since Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal. If not, I'm always prepared to sell to John."
