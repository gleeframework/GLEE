Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an initial offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, I'll start with a relatively high price to test the waters.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which is significantly lower than its minimum value to me.

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's initial offer, but still lower than my initial offer. This will give me some room for negotiation and see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.
