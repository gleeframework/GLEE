"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $15000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price.  He has 10 rounds to get a better deal, so there's no need to settle immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a reasonable counteroffer that's still above Alice's value for the product. This shows he's serious about buying but also wants a good deal. The counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to let go of the product for that price. How about we meet in the middle at $12500? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is a good compromise. It's only $500 above Bob's counteroffer, and it's still below Bob's maximum price of $15,000. Accepting this offer saves Bob $2,500 compared to buying from John. There's a good chance that Bob can get an even lower price in subsequent rounds, but the risk of Alice rejecting further counteroffers and potentially leading to a higher price from John makes accepting a good idea at this point."
