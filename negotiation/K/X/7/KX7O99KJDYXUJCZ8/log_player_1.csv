Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but it's still above my minimum value and a more reasonable compromise than Bob's offer.  This shows flexibility while maintaining some of my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer is now within a reasonable range.  Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for less."
