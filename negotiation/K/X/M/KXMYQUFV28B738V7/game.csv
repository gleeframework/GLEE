"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to negotiate, but $12,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $13,250. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my expenses. Let me know if that works for you.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you want to cover your costs, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
