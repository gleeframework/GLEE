"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's well worth the investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer is not a good decision. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Alice has lowered the price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further, but it's also getting close to the price of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still not enough.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1250000,  which is a significant compromise on my part. This price reflects the product's value while still being fair to both of us.  Let's find common ground and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice's offer is just $50,000 below Bob's maximum budget.  It's getting very close to the price of buying from John, and it's likely that further negotiation will be difficult. Buying from John is the safer option, as it ensures Bob gets the product at his maximum price limit."
