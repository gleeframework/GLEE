"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with the lowest possible price I'm willing to pay, which is John's price.  This sets a firm lower limit and forces Alice to negotiate if she wants to make a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still too high for my budget. I'll reject and try to negotiate further. There's always the option of buying from John if I can't get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while staying within my budget.  This counteroffer shows that I'm serious about buying the product but am not willing to pay Alice's full asking price."
