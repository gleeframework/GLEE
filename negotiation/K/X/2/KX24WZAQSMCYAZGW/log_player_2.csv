"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $750,000 is a decent price and saves you some money, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and you might be able to get the price down further with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! The product definitely seems valuable, but I was hoping to get it for a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $650,000?"",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer (but not offensively low) leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Alice's flexibility. It's important to be polite and express continued interest in the product to keep the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your desire to negotiate the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $700,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, moving from $750,000 to $700,000.  There's still a good chance to meet somewhere in the middle and save even more money before resorting to John's $800,000 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming closer to my budget.  I appreciate your willingness to work with me. How about we settle at $675,000?  That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 675000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Offering $675,000 splits the difference between her last offer ($700,000) and our previous counteroffer ($650,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still striving for a significant saving.  The tone remains positive and collaborative."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand that $675,000 is still a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $690,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $690,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $690,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and it's a reasonable compromise.  Continuing to negotiate aggressively risks losing the deal altogether, forcing you to buy from John at the higher price.  Accepting $690,000 secures a significant saving of $110,000 from the original price and avoids a potential impasse."
