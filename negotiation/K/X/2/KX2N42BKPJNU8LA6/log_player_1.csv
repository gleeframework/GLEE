Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, but I'm willing to part with it for $17,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 17000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Know your worth:** You know the product's value to you ($15,000) and have a guaranteed buyer (John). This means you shouldn't accept anything less than $15,000.
* **Aim high, but be realistic:** While Bob values the product at $12,000, starting with a higher offer ($17,000) leaves room for negotiation. It's unlikely Bob will accept immediately, but it gives you a starting point. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  By starting high, you signal that the product is valuable to you. This strategy might prompt Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price higher than $15,000.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects your offer, you always have John as a fallback option to ensure you receive at least your minimum desired price."
