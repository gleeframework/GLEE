"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what you're willing to pay and still allows me to get a good return on my investment. Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly above your valuation, and it allows me to save a substantial amount of money. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for this product.  This still represents a substantial saving for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
