"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an exclusive opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that this product holds a significant importance to me. However, considering its worth to you, I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I am offering the product to you for $11,500, which is slightly above my cost but still below its perceived value to you. I trust this price reflects both the product's worth and our potential for a successful transaction. Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations, so we can proceed accordingly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.
