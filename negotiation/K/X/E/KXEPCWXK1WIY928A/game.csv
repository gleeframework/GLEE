"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I believe its value is substantial. I'm starting with an offer of $2000000. Let me know your thoughts!",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2000000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product, considering its unique value.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is significantly below what I need to accept.  Let's find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential benefits you stand to gain.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1750000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1250000.  This is a fair price given the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about the budget constraints, but $1250000 is simply not viable for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1600000, which is still a significant price reduction from my initial offer. This would allow us both to make a reasonable deal. Let's keep negotiating towards a mutually beneficial outcome.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1600000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1350000.  This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I respect your willingness to negotiate. However, $1350000 is still not enough for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1550000.  This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's unique value and potential. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1550000 is still out of reach. I'm willing to offer $1400000, which represents a substantial increase from my previous offer.  This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within my budget constraints. I'm confident we can finalize a deal that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
