"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking for a price closer to $100. Can we negotiate towards that?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $137.50. Let's see if we can make this work.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I believe we can still find a middle ground. How about we aim for $120? It's a bit higher than my initial offer, but still within your original asking price.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $120 is still too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again. How about $128.75? This is a fair price that's closer to your offer, but still allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",128.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. Considering your last offer, I would like to propose $125 as a compromise. It's slightly above your previous offer, but still within my budget.",125.0,Bob,6,
