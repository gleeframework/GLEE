"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $8000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. Let me know what you think.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle again, and I'm offering $12000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good deal as well.  Let's get this done.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm happy to come up a little bit, but $16000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $14000 for the product.  This is a fair price that respects both our positions, and I'm confident it will allow us to reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $14000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $15500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal. I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. Let me know what you think.",15500.0,Alice,7,
