"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on the product and the potential savings you'll get compared to selling to John.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value to you and the potential savings I'll get compared to selling to John, I'm willing to offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",925000.0,Alice,5,
