"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's target of saving as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate further.  He's already shown his willingness to pay less, and Alice has shown some flexibility. A counteroffer might lead to a price closer to Bob's target."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. Considering the product's value to you and the potential savings I'll get compared to selling to John, I'm willing to offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is a significant drop from her initial offer and is closer to Bob's desired price range.  While further negotiation is possible, it's likely that Alice will be unwilling to go much lower. Accepting this offer secures the product for a good price, saving Bob $75,000 compared to buying from John."
