Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price is $15,000:**  I'm not willing to sell for less than this, because I can guarantee that amount from John.
* **Bob values the product at $8,000:**  I need to offer a price that is attractive to him, but not so low that I lose out on significant profit.
* **I'm trying to maximize profit:**  $14,000 is a good balance. It's significantly less than my minimum, giving Bob a good deal, but still allows me to earn a substantial profit.

**Outcome:**

* If Bob accepts, I earn $14,000.
* If Bob rejects, I sell to John for $15,000.

This strategy gives me the best chance of getting the highest price, while still having a backup plan to ensure a successful sale."
