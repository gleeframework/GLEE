"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the starting point, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,500 is closer to my target, it's still a bit too high. I'm prepared to offer $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's try to come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15,000.",11000.0,Alice,5,
