It's better to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's room to negotiate with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to budge. $9,000 is still a good deal for me, and it leaves room for negotiation."

I'm still going to reject Alice's offer. I can get the product for $10,000 from John, and it's worth trying to see if I can get Alice to lower her price even further."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $10,500. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying from her, but it's still below her current offer and closer to my ideal price from John."

Alice has met my counteroffer, so I'll accept. Buying from Alice at $10,500 is still a good deal, as I can get the product for $10,000 from John but save the hassle of negotiating further."
