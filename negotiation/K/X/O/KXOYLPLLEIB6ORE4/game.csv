"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8500? I believe this would still be a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I value your interest, $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9250? This would still leave you with a good price and allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with an offer of $9000. This price reflects the value I see in your product while staying within my budget. I hope this proposal works for you.",9000.0,Bob,4,
