"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This still leaves you with a good deal, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can close this.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $105? That feels fair to both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
