Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth a great deal and would like to offer it to you for $15,000."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's primary goal is to earn the most money. She knows Bob values the product at $12,000, which is her minimum acceptable price. Offering it significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potential profit beyond her fallback option (selling to John). 
* **First-mover Advantage:** By approaching Bob directly, Alice leverages the potential for a quick sale without the need for extensive negotiation or finding other buyers.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The $15,000 price is a starting point. It leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still allowing Alice a comfortable profit margin. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market Information:** This strategy assumes Alice doesn't have much information about Bob's financial situation or his willingness to pay above $12,000. If she had more insight, she could adjust her offer accordingly.
* **Relationship:** If Alice values a long-term relationship with Bob, she might consider a slightly less aggressive opening price. However, her guaranteed sale to John gives her leverage in this situation."
