Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have significant leverage. Starting high allows room for negotiation and increases the potential for maximizing profit. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing the product is worth $800,000 to Bob gives you a baseline. Offering it for significantly more tests the waters and gauges how much Bob might be willing to pay above market value.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, opening a dialogue where you can strategically negotiate towards a mutually beneficial price."
