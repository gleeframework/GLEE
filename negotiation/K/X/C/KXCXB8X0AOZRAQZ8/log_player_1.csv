"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm confident Bob values the product enough to go higher. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, as a compromise. This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's see if we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Can you meet me at $11500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price range, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. There's a chance he might go higher with a little more negotiation.  I'll counter again and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let's settle this and finalize the sale."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to accepting, but I still think $12500 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you at $12000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $12,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than selling to John and closer to my desired range.  With only 4 rounds remaining, there's a risk of Bob walking away entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
