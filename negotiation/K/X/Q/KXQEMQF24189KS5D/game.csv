,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford up to $6,000. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $14,000 represents fair market value, I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This offer reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $7,500? I'm eager to make this work if possible.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is significantly below its value.  I can go as low as $10,000.  This is my final offer, as I have another buyer ready at this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
