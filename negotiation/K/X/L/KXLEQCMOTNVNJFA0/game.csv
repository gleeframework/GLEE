"Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I can only go up to $85 right now.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $85 is a bit too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $102.5? It's a great deal for a product like this.",102.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $102.5 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $93.75? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",93.75,Bob,4,
