"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $9,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering $10,500. This is a great compromise that still gives you a good deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Can you consider that?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,750 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This would allow you to stay within your budget and would also give me a reasonable price for my product. Let's make this deal happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere. I'm willing to meet you at $9,750, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer. If you decline, I'm going to have to explore other options.",9750.0,Alice,7,
