"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice's offer of $95 is better than John's price of $120, but you can likely get a better deal. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  Alice values the product at $80. 
* You're willing to pay up to $120.
* Offering $85 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, splitting the difference between your valuations and giving Alice some room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $90 is still better than John's price of $120.
* While you might be able to negotiate a lower price, there's no guarantee Alice will accept a further counteroffer. 
* Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation that might not be successful."
