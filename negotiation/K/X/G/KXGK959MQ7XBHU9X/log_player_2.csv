Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective on the price,  $1200000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum value. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1750000. This price still reflects the product's unique value, and I believe it's a fair middle ground.  Let's keep the conversation going, and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.
