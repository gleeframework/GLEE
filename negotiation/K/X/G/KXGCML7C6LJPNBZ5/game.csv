"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its potential worth, I'm asking for $900,000.  I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value you'll gain.  Let me know your thoughts!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the value of the product, $900,000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which is a fair price given my evaluation of the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. I'm prepared to offer the product for $850,000. This reflects a fair price considering the value you'll gain.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is a significant step closer to your initial offer.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
