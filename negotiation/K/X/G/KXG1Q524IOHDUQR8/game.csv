"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1000000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand you're looking for a great deal, $1000000 simply doesn't cover my costs. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be compensated fairly for this valuable product.  I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1050000.  This price represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and is still a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still trying to make this a good deal for myself. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1020000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1020000.0,Bob,4,
