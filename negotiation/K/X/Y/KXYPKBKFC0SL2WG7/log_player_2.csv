# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your ideal price. You can likely negotiate a better price, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the most strategic move."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate further. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $1,100,000. This price still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than my desired price of $1,000,000. There's still room for negotiation, so I'll reject the offer and try to counteroffer again."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: $1,080,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's final offer of $1,080,000 is closer to my desired price of $1,000,000.  While I'd still prefer to pay less,  the negotiation has reached a point where further counteroffers might risk losing the deal entirely.  At this price, I'm saving a significant amount compared to buying from John, making this a good deal."
