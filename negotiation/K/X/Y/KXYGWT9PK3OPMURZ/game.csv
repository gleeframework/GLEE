"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $900,000. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the product's value and your potential profit, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $975,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we've both discussed. Let's make this happen.",975000.0,Alice,5,
