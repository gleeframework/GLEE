"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to lower the price to $1,100,000.  This reflects the significant value this product offers you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit above $1,000,000, and I'd like to get closer to that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,100,000. How about $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is a bit too low for me. It's clear we're both motivated to make a deal, so let's aim for something in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
