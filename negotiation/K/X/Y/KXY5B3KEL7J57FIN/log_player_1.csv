Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a price that I believe is fair and gives me a decent profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but I'm prepared to negotiate if needed.  I'm also aware of John's offer, which gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  $8,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to meet me halfway. If he doesn't, I'm still willing to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and make another counteroffer. While I could sell to John for $12,000, I'm hoping I can get a slightly higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise, as I'm willing to come down from my previous offer of $12,000.  However, it's still a fair price, and I'm hoping Bob will finally agree. If he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John for $12,000."
