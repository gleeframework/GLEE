"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own a high-quality item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm very interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you consider $12000? That's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on this item.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $16000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm happy to pay $14000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget. Let's see if we can make a deal.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $14000 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price around $15500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $15500 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to go up to $15000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,6,
