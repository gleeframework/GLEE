Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's still a great deal considering its value to me, but I'm trying to be responsible with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm confident I can get a better deal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $1,400,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the value the product holds for you, and allows me to meet my minimum requirements. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly the amount John is willing to pay. While I'd prefer a higher price, this is a safe bet. I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to start all over with John."
