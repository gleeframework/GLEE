Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a price that is still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but leaves room for potential negotiation.  It also takes into account the fact that Bob values the product at $80, so there is a potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a compromise from my previous offer of $110, but still above my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair offer and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not confident that I can get a better deal with Bob. I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120, as this guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and allows me to move on."
