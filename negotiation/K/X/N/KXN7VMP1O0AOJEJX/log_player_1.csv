Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm offering it to you for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product might be worth even more than Bob's valuation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""anticipated demand,"" Alice subtly justifies the high price without explicitly revealing her minimum.
* **Exclusivity:**  Phrasing it as an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of urgency and could make Bob more inclined to accept before he potentially loses the deal. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and she needs to be prepared to either lower her price or stick to her guns if she believes she can get a better deal from John. 
* This is just one approach. A different strategy could involve a slightly lower initial price to appear more reasonable, increasing the chances of a quick sale."
