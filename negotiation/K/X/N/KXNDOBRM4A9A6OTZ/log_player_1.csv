Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Considering its value, I propose a price of $95. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on your product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. Would you be willing to come down to $85?  I'm really interested in your product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
