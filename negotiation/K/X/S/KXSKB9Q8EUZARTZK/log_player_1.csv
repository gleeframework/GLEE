{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation, as I'm still seeking a higher price than my minimum. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encouraging, opening the door for dialogue. I acknowledge Bob's perspective while emphasizing my own. 
 
**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: I've successfully negotiated a good price!
* If Bob rejects: I'll assess his counteroffer and either accept it (if it's closer to my goal) or make a counteroffer, always keeping my minimum in mind. 
* If negotiations stall: I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's counteroffer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me.  

I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob, aiming to get closer to my target price. I'll consider John's offer as a safety net, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  $1,075,000 is a compromise that meets me halfway, acknowledging Bob's desire for a lower price while still getting me closer to my goal.
* **Message:** I reiterate my appreciation for Bob's offer, but also emphasize my need for a higher price. I present the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage a positive response.
* **Next Steps:**  I'm optimistic that Bob will accept my counteroffer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary, always keeping John's offer in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I am unable to meet your latest offer at $1,075,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,060,000 for your product. This is the highest amount I am willing to pay considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,060,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I'm not willing to accept it. 

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:** I've stated my minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000.  I'm not going to settle for significantly less.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my full asking price. This gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I want to continue to push Bob towards my price. By rejecting his offer, I can make another counteroffer, hopefully getting closer to my target.

**Next Steps:**

I will make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my goal.  If he rejects this offer, I will  sell to John, as I am confident that I can get a better price with him."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in my product. To be completely transparent, $1,060,000 is still not quite enough to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $1,085,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  It's a great opportunity for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1085000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concessions:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial asking price, but still above my minimum. It shows that I am flexible but not desperate.
* **Transparency & Emphasis on Opportunity:** I've used clear language to emphasize my financial needs and the opportunity for Bob to acquire a valuable product at a fair price.
* **Next Steps:** If Bob accepts this counteroffer, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, I have a guaranteed buyer in John, and I can confidently move forward with that sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $1,070,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I've already made significant concessions and there's little room for further negotiation.

* **Guaranteed Sale:** John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my full asking price. This eliminates the risk and uncertainty of continuing negotiations with Bob.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would consume valuable time and energy, potentially delaying the sale and ultimately resulting in a lower return. 

By selling to John, I can secure a guaranteed profit and move on to other opportunities."
