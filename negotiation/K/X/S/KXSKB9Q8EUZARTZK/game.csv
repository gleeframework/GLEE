"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's make this happen.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. However, I am unable to meet your latest offer at $1,075,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,060,000 for your product. This is the highest amount I am willing to pay considering its value to me.",1060000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in my product. To be completely transparent, $1,060,000 is still not quite enough to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $1,085,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  It's a great opportunity for both of us.",1085000.0,Alice,5,
