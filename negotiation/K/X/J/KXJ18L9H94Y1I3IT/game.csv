"Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and its value far exceeds what either of us could achieve alone. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $1,300,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to be more convinced of its value. My counteroffer is $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $900,000 significantly undervalues the potential this product holds. I've factored in market value and added a premium reflecting its unique capabilities. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to be convinced that the product's value justifies the cost. My counteroffer is $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the unique capabilities of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
