Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high price of $18,000. This is because:

* **I want to maximize my profit.** 
* **I don't know Bob's valuation.**  Offering a higher price allows for more room for negotiation and potentially a more favorable outcome for me.

I'm aware that Bob might reject this offer, but that's okay.  The negotiation process allows me to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take the $12,000, I'm not willing to settle for my minimum right away. 

Here's why:

* **I'm not sure if I'm dealing with a strong negotiator or a buyer who is simply trying to lowball me.**  
* **I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price.** 

I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price, but still above my minimum. This gives me a chance to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm offering $15,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price, considering he rejected my initial offer.  

I'm trying to balance my desire to make a profit with the need to be reasonable in my negotiations.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Bob's offer is higher than John's offer.**  This means I'm getting a better price than my guaranteed fallback option.
* **We're getting closer to a deal.** While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is within a reasonable range. 
* **More rounds of negotiation might not lead to a significantly better price.**  There's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I'll end up selling to John for the minimum.

It's important to recognize that negotiation is about finding a win-win solution.  In this case, accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a decent price and avoid the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
