That's a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us.,100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $112.50.  It's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product.",112.5,Bob,4,
