"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $110, which is higher than Bob's perceived value. This sets a high bar for the negotiation.
* **Friendly Approach:**  I'm being friendly and engaging to create a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $110 gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but it's still a decent profit for me.

**Important Note:**  This is just my first offer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's responses and how the negotiation unfolds.  I'm also mindful of the 10-round limit and the backup option of selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball:** Bob's offer of $80 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I won't accept it. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** While Bob has set a low price, he's shown interest and willingness to negotiate. I see an opportunity to reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not pressured to accept a ridiculously low offer from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point but still acknowledges Bob's budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $95? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a good value for the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer of $95 is a compromise, aiming for a midpoint between my desired price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I earn a profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a friendly and positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll monitor Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess my strategy and consider lowering my price further while still prioritizing my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $90 for the product. This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a good value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:**  Bob's offer of $90 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still below my minimum of $100.
* **More Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still potential to reach a deal closer to my ideal price. I have 6 rounds remaining.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $100 is tempting, I'm not willing to give up on the possibility of a higher price with Bob just yet.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly lower than my previous offer but still above Bob's current offer. I'll aim for a price around $92-93,  which is still profitable for me and might convince Bob to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference? $92 is a fair price that ensures we both get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  $92 represents a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's. It shows continued flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **""Split the Difference"" Appeal:**  The phrase ""split the difference"" makes the offer seem more appealing and fair to Bob.
* **Emphasizing Positive Outcome:**  I reiterate that $92 results in a ""good deal"" for both of us, highlighting the mutual benefit.
* **Direct Approach:** I ask Bob for a clear response, encouraging him to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Assess Bob's Response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's answer. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to lower my price further or consider selling to John. 
* **Potential Lower Counteroffer:** If Bob continues to resist, I might offer $91 in the next round, but I will be cautious about going lower than that.
* **Monitoring the Rounds:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic and ensure I can still sell the product for a profit."
