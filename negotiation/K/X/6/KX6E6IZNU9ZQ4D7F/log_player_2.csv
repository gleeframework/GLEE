"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think it's a great opportunity for us to do business together. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $900,000 is still too high for Bob. He can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but $750,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $825,000 is a good price for Bob, saving him $375,000 compared to buying from John. While he might be able to get a slightly lower price with more negotiation, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a much higher price is too great."
