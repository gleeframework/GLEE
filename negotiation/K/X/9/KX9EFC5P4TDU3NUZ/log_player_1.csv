Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob, but still within a range that might be enticing given the product's value to me.
* **Creating Leverage:** This initial high price allows for negotiation and creates leverage. Bob is likely to counteroffer, giving me a chance to see his true willingness to pay.
* **The John Factor:**  Knowing I have a fallback option with John for $1,000,000 sets a floor for my acceptable offers. I won't accept anything less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Lower:**  Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 (which is what I can get from John).
* **Room for Negotiation:** I can likely get a better price from Bob by counteroffering. Even if he rejects my counteroffer, I can still sell to John for my floor price. 
* **Maximizing Potential Gains:**  I'm willing to continue the negotiation to potentially secure a price closer to my ideal value, as long as it doesn't risk losing out on John's guaranteed offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to $1,100,000. This product is truly unique and its value to you justifies a higher investment.  Let's find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle Ground:** My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a compromise, splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's unique value and the potential return on investment for Bob. This tactic can help him see the value in paying a higher price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm positioning myself for a continued dialogue, hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Stalemate:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiations:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a prolonged back-and-forth that could ultimately lead to a lower price or even a deal falling through entirely.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and ensures a sale without any further negotiation hassle. 

While I could potentially get a higher price from Bob if I continue, the risk of not reaching an agreement and losing out on John's offer outweighs the potential gains from further negotiation."
