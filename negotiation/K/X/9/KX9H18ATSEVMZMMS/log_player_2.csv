You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice my maximum price, which is $10,000. This is a significant drop from her initial offer, but it's still within my budget. I hope to reach a compromise that allows me to purchase the product without overspending."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $16,000 is still above my budget. While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems like Alice isn't being very flexible. It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing: buying from John for $10,000."
