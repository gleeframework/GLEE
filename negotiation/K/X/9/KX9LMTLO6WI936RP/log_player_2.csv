{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if a lower price can be reached."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much as possible, but also needs to be realistic.
* A counteroffer of $1,050,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* This price is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for potential further negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob is now getting close to his maximum budget, but wants to see if he can get the product for slightly less than his limit.
* Offering $1,100,000 is a significant increase from the previous offer, showing a genuine effort to meet Alice's price point.
* This offer is still slightly lower than Alice's current offer, which keeps the negotiation alive.
* If Alice rejects, Bob might consider buying from John in the next round as it's getting closer to his limit."
