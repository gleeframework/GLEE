Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is within his budget, he can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows him to start negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a strong starting point for negotiation. Bob is still within his budget and is showing Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $110 is a good deal for Bob. It's within his budget and lower than his initial counteroffer.  While he could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price, and he risks losing the deal entirely. It's a smart move to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
