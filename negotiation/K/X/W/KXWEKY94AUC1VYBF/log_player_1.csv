{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum price, but still below the product's value to Bob. It gives Bob room to negotiate without feeling like he's losing out completely. If he rejects, I'm prepared to counter and eventually close the deal with John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to negotiating. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, but I want to see if I can push for a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which is still a great deal considering the value this product brings. Let's try to find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still above my target price. I'm willing to offer $1,550,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and considering the potential risk of continuing negotiations, I'd rather secure a sale now. It's also close enough to my initial target that I'm happy with the outcome."
