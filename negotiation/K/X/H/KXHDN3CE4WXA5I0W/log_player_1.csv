"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's 20% higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and still secure a good profit. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate as he values the product at $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer and what the product is worth to me. It's a good sign that he's willing to negotiate, so I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm offering $1,100,000 which is still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer.  This shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a profit close to what the product is worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}

I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a significant decrease from my previous offer but still represents a good profit for me. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering Bob's counteroffers."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, I'm satisfied with selling at $1,000,000.  This is a win-win scenario as Bob gets the product at his desired price, and I achieve my minimum goal."
