"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, my budget is limited, and I am looking for a price closer to $1,000,000. I would like to make a counteroffer at $1,250,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds that amount. I'm willing to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $1,250,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,425,000? This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1425000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, my budget is quite tight. I would like to propose a counteroffer at $1,375,000. This is still above my initial offer but closer to your current proposal. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to stay above $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile.  Would you be willing to consider $1,365,000?",1365000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the effort to reach an agreement. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to make a final counteroffer at $1,355,000. This is my best offer, and I hope it will be acceptable.",1355000.0,Bob,6,
