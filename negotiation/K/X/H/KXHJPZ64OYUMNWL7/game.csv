,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out.  I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $115?  Let's see if we can make this work.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $115 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $120?  That's my absolute limit, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,4,
