"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit too high for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $80. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price from $120 to $100, and now you're asking me to go all the way down to $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a profit. I can sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,5,
