"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good deal, it's not the best possible outcome.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  $11,000 is a reasonable counteroffer that still leaves room for potential negotiation.  It's important to provide a message that expresses interest while also stating a clear price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can both be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target.  Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, but he wants to save as much money as possible. Rejecting Alice's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is a fair compromise and would make this a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to find a price that's reasonable for both parties.  He's increased his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is a good middle ground and leaves some room for Alice to negotiate if she needs to."
