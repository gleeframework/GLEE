"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe holds significant value for those seeking excellence in its field. Given its quality and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $150 for it. I trust this aligns well with its worth and offers you a fair opportunity to acquire it.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's quality. While I see its potential, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it, as that's my budget for this kind of product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am willing to meet you halfway at $125. This price reflects the value we place on the product while accommodating your budget. I hope this proposal works for you.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $125 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of $100. If you're not able to accept that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your budgetary considerations. After reevaluating the situation, I am willing to sell the product to you for $110. This is the best I can do, considering the value of the product. I hope this revised offer meets your needs.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm going to stick to my $100 offer. If you're unable to go lower, I'll have to go with John's deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
