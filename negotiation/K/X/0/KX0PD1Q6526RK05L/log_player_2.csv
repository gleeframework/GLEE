"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's not the best possible outcome. Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in this product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal on this product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is closer to his desired price, it's still not ideal.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a good deal, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,250? It's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the way you think, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,250 just yet. I'll meet you halfway between $14,250 and $14,500, which is $14,375. Let's see if we can shake on it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:** While Bob can potentially get a lower price by continuing to negotiate, the risk is that Alice will either counter with a higher price or walk away completely. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Buying from John for $15,000 is more expensive than Alice's current offer.
* **Time:** With only 5 rounds left, time is becoming a factor. Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a good price without risking a breakdown in negotiations. 

Bob can get a reasonably good deal with this offer and avoid the risk of losing out on a deal with Alice or having to pay more to John."
