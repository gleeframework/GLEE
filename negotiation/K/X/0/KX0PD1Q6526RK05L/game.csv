"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in this product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal on this product. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",14500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a good deal, but $14,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,250? It's a fair compromise for both of us.",14250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,250 just yet. I'll meet you halfway between $14,250 and $14,500, which is $14,375. Let's see if we can shake on it at this price.",14375.0,Alice,5,
