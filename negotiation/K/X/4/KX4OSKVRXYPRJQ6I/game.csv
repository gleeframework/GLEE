"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, as it's my maximum limit. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product truly is valuable and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're not seeing eye-to-eye here. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,000 is simply too low. My final offer is $15,500.  This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's more than fair. ",15500.0,Alice,5,
