"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is way too high. It's above your maximum budget and there's plenty of room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $20,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, as it's my maximum limit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $20,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product truly is valuable and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a move in the right direction, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm confident I can negotiate further and get the price down closer to my target.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that we're not seeing eye-to-eye here. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,000 is simply too low. My final offer is $15,500.  This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's more than fair.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. While I'm confident I could negotiate further, I'm also aware that I have a limited number of rounds.  It's not guaranteed that Alice will budge any further, and I risk the possibility of reaching the round limit without a deal. Given that I have a guaranteed alternative with John at my target price, it's more strategically sound to buy from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Alice."
