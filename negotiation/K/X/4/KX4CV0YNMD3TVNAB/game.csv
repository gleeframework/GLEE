"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,350,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your understanding of the value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
