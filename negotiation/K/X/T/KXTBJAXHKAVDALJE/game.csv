"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that I believe would be of great value to you. Considering its worth to me and its potential benefits to you, I propose a price of $95 for this product.",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $95 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I'd like to counter your offer by proposing a price of $90 for the product. This is still slightly above your initial offer but below my original asking price. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still compensating for the value I place on the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85. Let's see if we can close this deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I respect your valuation of the product. In light of this, I am willing to accept an offer of $87 for the product. This is a fair compromise between our positions and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",87.0,Alice,5,
