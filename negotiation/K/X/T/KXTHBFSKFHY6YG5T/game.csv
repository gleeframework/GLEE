"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However,  $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider a price of $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",925000.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I still think $925,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. This is my final offer for now.",775000.0,Bob,4,,
