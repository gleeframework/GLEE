Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. However,  $700,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I could consider a price of $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I still think $925,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $775,000. This is my final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking below our minimum acceptable price. While he might eventually go higher, there's a risk he won't, and we'd waste valuable time. Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees us our minimum and avoids further negotiation."
