"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $9,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above my budget, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I've already made significant concessions, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower. It's more advantageous to buy the product from John at $8,000 and avoid further negotiation."
