"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $8500. It's a fair price, and I'm confident that it's a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
