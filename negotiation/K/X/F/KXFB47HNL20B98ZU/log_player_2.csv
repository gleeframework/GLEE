{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. This is the best option for him as it is within his budget and allows him to secure the product. While there's a chance Alice might accept his counteroffer in the next round, the risk is too high. It's unlikely Alice will come down to his desired price, and he's already used eight rounds of negotiations. He's running out of time and should take the guaranteed deal with John."
