"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. However, I was hoping to find a way to bring the price down even further. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $8500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9200. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product. Let me know if this works for you!",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose an alternative offer of $8750.

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8750, but I'm willing to meet you at $9000 again.
