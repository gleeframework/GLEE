{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is higher than my minimum, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter and gauge his true interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping I can get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price closer to $9,000 to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering $9,500. This is still a decent profit for me, and I'm hoping it's attractive enough for Bob to consider. If he rejects, I'll have to decide if it's worth continuing negotiations or just selling to John."

I'm accepting Bob's offer. $9,000 is a good price, considering my minimum is $8,000. While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, I'm happy to secure this deal."
