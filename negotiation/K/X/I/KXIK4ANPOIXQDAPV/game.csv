"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to offer $8,500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us. ",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $9,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750. This is a good compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'd like to counteroffer at $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,200 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  To make this work, I'm willing to go up to $8,900. This is a good compromise, and it's closer to my budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8900.0,Bob,6,
