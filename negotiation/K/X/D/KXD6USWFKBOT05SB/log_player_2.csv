"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Given its quality and uniqueness, it's worth more than $120 to you. Considering this, I would like to propose a fair deal of $140 for the product. This price not only ensures a reasonable profit for me but also provides you with a great value for your money. I believe we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $120 for the product. While Alice's offer is lower than her valuation, it's still higher than your maximum. It's better to reject her offer and buy the product from John for $120, saving you $20."
