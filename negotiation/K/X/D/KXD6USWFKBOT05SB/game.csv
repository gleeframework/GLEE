"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Given its quality and uniqueness, it's worth more than $120 to you. Considering this, I would like to propose a fair deal of $140 for the product. This price not only ensures a reasonable profit for me but also provides you with a great value for your money. I believe we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",140.0,Alice,1,
