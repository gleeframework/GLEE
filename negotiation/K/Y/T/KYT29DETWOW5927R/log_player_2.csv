# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for a special price of $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get this valuable item at a discounted rate. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than her product's worth to her, you know you can get a better deal from John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to purchase the product for your target price of $1,000,000."
