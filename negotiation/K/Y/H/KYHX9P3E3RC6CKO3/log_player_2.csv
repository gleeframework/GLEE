"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it from me for $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a decent starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her valuation. This leaves room for further negotiation while signaling that I'm serious about buying the product at a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I think there's still some room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about $120? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

I'm offering a price that is the maximum I am willing to pay and is also the same as Alice's valuation. This gives Alice a final chance to accept a price that works for both of us, without going over my budget."
