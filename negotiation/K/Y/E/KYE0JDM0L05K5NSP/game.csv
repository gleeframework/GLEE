"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $140 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $157.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",157.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $157.50 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me at $145?",145.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $152.50? It's a compromise, but it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",152.5,Alice,5,
