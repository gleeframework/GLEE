"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1200000 is higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its potential value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000 to acknowledge your interest. This price still reflects the product's value and gives us both a good deal. Let's work together to finalize this transaction.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
