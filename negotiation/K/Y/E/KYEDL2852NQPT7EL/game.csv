"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. ",9500.0,Alice,5,
