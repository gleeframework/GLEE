Alice's offer is too high. We can try negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's starting price. This leaves room for negotiation while still being a price we'd be happy to pay."

Alice is coming down, but we're still aiming for a price closer to $70. It's worth another counteroffer."

We're getting closer to a price that works for both of us. This offer is a reasonable compromise between our initial offer and Alice's latest price."

Alice has reached her minimum price, and it's a good deal for us. We save $20 compared to John's offer."
