"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it, which is a fair price considering its value to me.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet halfway and settle on $16,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $10,000. I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product to both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
