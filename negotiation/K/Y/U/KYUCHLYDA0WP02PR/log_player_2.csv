"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** Bob is trying to find a price that's closer to Alice's minimum while still being within his budget. 
* **Negotiation Tactic:**  By offering $12,500, Bob shows a willingness to negotiate, but he also sets a clear limit. 
* **Potential for Compromise:** There's room for compromise between $12,500 and Alice's minimum of $12,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $12,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $13,500?  This gives us both a good deal, and I think it's a fair price given the value you see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price Compromise:** Alice has lowered her price from $14,000 to $13,500, which is closer to Bob's ideal price point. 
* **Value to Bob:** While $13,500 is not the absolute lowest Bob could get, it's still within his budget and offers a significant savings compared to buying from John. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice walking away from the deal, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price."
