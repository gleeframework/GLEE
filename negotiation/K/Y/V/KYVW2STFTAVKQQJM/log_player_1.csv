Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This gives you a significant discount compared to its true worth to you. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Highlight Value:**  Emphasizing the product's worth to Bob might make him more amenable to a higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. If Bob rejects it, there's still room to negotiate down towards $800,000 before considering John's offer."
