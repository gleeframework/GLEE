Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,300,000 represents a fair reflection of the product's true worth, I understand the need to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This offer takes into account the unique value this product brings.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to compromise further, but $1,600,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.  How about we settle at $1,900,000? This feels like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.
