"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,400,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
