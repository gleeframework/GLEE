I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum of $12,000 and allows room for negotiation. I believe it's a fair starting point, and I'm confident that I can secure a good deal without needing to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I can't accept such a low price. I will counter-offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm dropping my price to $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair compromise.  If he rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John to guarantee my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still a little below my initial target, it's close enough to my minimum.  I'd rather secure the sale with Bob than risk further negotiation or selling to John for a lower profit."
