Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers excellent value, even at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $15,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially earn even more. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still staying above our minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  The message frames the price as a potential bargain, increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting. 
 
**Important Note:**  This offer aims to maximize profit while balancing the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. There's always a chance Bob might counter-offer,  in which case we'll need to re-evaluate based on his proposal."
