Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While I know Bob only values the product at $80, I want to start with a price closer to my minimum ($150). There's a chance he might accept, especially if he doesn't want to miss out. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The $120 offer leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer. This keeps the conversation going and gives me more information about his willingness to pay.
* **Backup plan (John):**  It's important to remember I have a guaranteed buyer at $150. This knowledge gives me confidence to aim higher with Bob."
