Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 17000}

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully still get a decent profit. However, I'm also conscious of the fact that Bob might walk away, so I haven't set the price too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, but it's not a bad price. However, I believe I can still get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.  I want to see if I can bridge the gap a little bit more before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on this one.  $15,500 is still a decent profit for me, and it's closer to his offer than my previous one. Hopefully, this will be enough to entice him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now getting too low for me to accept. Even though I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to go much lower than $15,000.  Selling to John is the best option for me at this point."
