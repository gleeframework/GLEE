Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message makes Bob more likely to engage in negotiation.
* **John as a Backup:**  I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me leverage and a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering.  $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob is willing to negotiate, so there's a chance we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can sell to John for $10,000, which is still a good outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested! $8,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm lowering my price, but not by too much. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still have some leverage. 
* **Middle Ground:** $9,500 is halfway between my last offer and Bob's offer, making it a reasonable compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  Staying polite and positive will encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I could potentially do $8,700.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $8,700 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, suggesting a deal might be possible.
* **John is a safety net:** If I can't get a better offer from Bob, I can always sell to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $9,100 for the product. This is a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is close to Bob's latest offer and slightly above my minimum.  It demonstrates a genuine effort to reach an agreement.
* **Fairness:** Emphasize the compromise aspect to make it seem like a fair deal for both parties.
* **Decision Time:**  This offer puts the ball back in Bob's court, making him decide if he wants to accept or walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'd be willing to go up to $8,900. That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $8,900 is still less than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to be fruitful:** Bob has stated that his offer is final, so further negotiation is unlikely to lead to a higher price.
* **John's offer is a safe and profitable alternative:**  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a higher price than Bob's offer. 

It's better to accept the guaranteed $10,000 from John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob that might not lead to a better outcome."
