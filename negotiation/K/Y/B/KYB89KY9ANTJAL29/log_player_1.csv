Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation with Bob significantly above his perceived value but below your guaranteed price. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other buyers to create a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The price leaves some room for negotiation if Bob attempts to haggle. 
* **Profit Maximization:** This strategy aims to get you the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept. 
 
This approach balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, you've secured a price significantly higher than his perceived value. If he rejects it, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer."
