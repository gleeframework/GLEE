"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?",10000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand you're interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $12,000. What do you think?"
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",11500.0,Alice,3,,

"I understand where you're coming from, Alice.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,"I appreciate the compromise, Bob, but I'm not comfortable with $10,750. I'll try to meet you in the middle again, so I'll counteroffer at $12,250. What do you think?"
"I'm not willing to go any lower, Bob. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price.",12500.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, you said that's your final offer, but I'm hoping we can still find a price that works for both of us. I'd be willing to go up to $11,000.  What do you say?",11000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12,500. I'm starting to think that maybe this isn't the right deal for me. I'll hold out for the price I want."
"I've made it clear what I'm willing to sell the product for, Bob. I'm not budging from $12,500. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'll give you one last chance to make a serious offer, but I'm not making any further concessions.",12500.0,Alice,7,,
