Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've made it clear what I'm willing to sell the product for, Bob. I'm not budging from $12,500. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm going to have to consider other options. I'll give you one last chance to make a serious offer, but I'm not making any further concessions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice seems firm on her price, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $12,500. While it's not the $11,000 you were hoping for, it's still a significant saving compared to John's $15,000 price. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiations breaking down and having to pay more elsewhere."
