Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Be positive:** A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Leave room for counteroffers:**  I'm not asking for the full $100 from John right away. This allows me to potentially get more from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $100.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show willingness to compromise:** By lowering my price from $110 to $95, I'm demonstrating flexibility and commitment to a deal.
* **Highlight fairness:**  I'm framing $95 as a ""fair price"" for both of us. This emphasizes that I'm not trying to take advantage and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  I'm not yet at Bob's price of $90, so there's still room to bargain.  

This counteroffer keeps the negotiations moving forward without sacrificing too much of my desired profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go as low as $85? I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum threshold of $100.  While I could continue negotiating, I'm now confident that John will buy the product for $100.  It's more efficient and guarantees me a profit at my desired minimum."
