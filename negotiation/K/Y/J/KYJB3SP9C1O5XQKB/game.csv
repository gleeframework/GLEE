"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $95?  That's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,

I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go as low as $85? I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.,85.0,Bob,4,
