"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm open to discussing a fair price. Would you be interested in an initial offer of $10,000?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize potential profit.  
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm willing to discuss and be flexible. 
* **Leaving Room:**  $10,000 is a good starting point, allowing room for negotiation without immediately hitting my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase it. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $7500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value.**  $7,500 is less than my $8,000 floor. 
* **I have more rounds to negotiate.** I still have 9 rounds to potentially get a better price. 
* **Selling to John is an option.** While John's offer is my minimum, it's a safety net if I can't secure a better price with Bob. 

**Next Move:** I will counteroffer Bob to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $7,500 is lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8,500? This would allow me to still make a fair profit, and hopefully it's within your budget."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob halfway:**  I'm counteroffering with $8,500, which is a compromise between my minimum price and his offer.
* **Staying Above My Minimum:**  $8,500 is still above my $8,000 minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $8000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum price:** $8,000 is the absolute lowest I'm willing to sell for.
* **No further negotiation:**  It's unlikely I can get a better price from Bob.  
* **Time is valuable:**  Accepting avoids risking further rounds and potential rejection.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure my minimum desired value and avoid the risk of losing out on a sale."
