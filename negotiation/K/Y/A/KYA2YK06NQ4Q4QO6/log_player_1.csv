Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting high, at $170, knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob. This gives him room to negotiate while still ensuring I make more than my minimum of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is more than my minimum, I'm not satisfied. I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $160,  trying to find a middle ground. This shows flexibility while still leaving room for potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $145 is now only $5 away from my minimum acceptable price. It's getting late in the negotiation, and it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob.  Accepting this offer is the best choice to secure a sale and avoid losing out on a potentially better deal with John."
