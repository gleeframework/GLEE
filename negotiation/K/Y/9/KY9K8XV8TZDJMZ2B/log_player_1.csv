"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is well above your minimum of $80, giving you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $120 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to Bob ($150), giving him a strong incentive to accept.
* **It's a reasonable opening price:** It's not overly aggressive, allowing for a back and forth negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I think $90 would be a fair price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price point.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
