**Reasoning:**

Bob seems firmly anchored at $937,500 and is unlikely to move significantly higher. We've gone through multiple rounds of offers and counteroffers, and his price increases are becoming marginal. Accepting his offer would net us $937,500. However, we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. 

At this point, the potential gain from continuing negotiations with Bob is outweighed by the risk of him not increasing his offer substantially.  It's in our best interest to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
