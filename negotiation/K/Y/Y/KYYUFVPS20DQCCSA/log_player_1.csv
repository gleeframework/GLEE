"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how interested Bob is and how he values the product. His response will be telling about his willingness to pay.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind, you have John as a backup buyer at $1,500,000. This gives you leverage and the confidence to start high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Considering the value you've stated, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this price is fair, allowing us both to benefit from the transaction.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While his message aims to appear reasonable, accepting this offer would leave a significant amount of money on the table. 

You have the leverage to negotiate further:

* **John as Backup:**  You have the security of John's offer at $1,500,000, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a low offer from Bob.
* **Early Stages:** It's only the second round, and there's ample time to negotiate a better deal.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you're serious about getting a fair price and are willing to walk away from the deal if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. While I understand your position, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is a competitive offer considering its unique value."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  Coming down by $200,000 demonstrates your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
* **Still Above Bob's Offer:** This counteroffer keeps the price significantly higher than Bob's initial offer,  reinforcing the product's value.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  While you're being flexible, you're also holding firm to a price that's comfortably above your minimum. You're aiming to guide the negotiation towards a favorable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $1,800,000 remains above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while staying within my financial constraints. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum acceptable price, but it's still $100,000 short. While you are aiming for a compromise, it's too early to settle. Here's why:

* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's message indicates he's willing to find a compromise. This suggests there's still room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer:**  You have the security of John's offer at $1,500,000, meaning you don't need to accept anything below that.
* **Strategic Timing:** It's only round 4, and you're making progress. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you believe the product is worth more, potentially motivating Bob to increase his offer further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $1,600,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** You're offering a compromise by going down to $1,600,000, but you're also setting a firm boundary with the ""final offer"" statement.
* **Encouraging a Decision:** By stating this is your final offer, you're encouraging Bob to make a decision. He's now faced with either accepting a price significantly better than his previous offer or risking losing the deal altogether.
* **Alternative Option:** You're still above your safety net of $1,500,000 from John, giving you leverage. This approach balances firmness with flexibility, aiming for a successful negotiation."
