Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer. While I understand your position, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This is a competitive offer considering its unique value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $2,000,000, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value. However, $1,800,000 remains above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth while staying within my financial constraints. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value.  I'm open to finding a solution that works for us both. To meet you halfway, I'd be willing to accept $1,600,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,500,000, as it guarantees you the product at your desired price.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a lower price, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from John."
