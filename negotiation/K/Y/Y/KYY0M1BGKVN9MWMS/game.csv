"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way beyond my budget for this.  I could consider a price closer to $5,000. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet around $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, you're getting close! I'd be willing to do $8,000 even, and I think that's a fair offer.  If that works, we have a deal.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,7,
