"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum budget. You should definitely reject and counter-offer with a much lower price to start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way beyond my budget for this.  I could consider a price closer to $5,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down from Alice's initial offer. It establishes a starting point for negotiation well below your $8,000 maximum, giving you room to bargain upwards if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $12,000 is still above your budget. You should reject and counter-offer, aiming to meet somewhere closer to your $8,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet around $6,500?"",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```

We're moving closer to a potential agreement. This counter-offer shows you're willing to negotiate upwards, but also keeps you within a reasonable distance of your $8,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough one! Alice is getting closer to your limit, but it's still above your target price. Since you have some wiggle room, it's worth trying one more counteroffer before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're getting close! I'd be willing to do $8,000 even, and I think that's a fair offer.  If that works, we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

This is your maximum budget, so this counter-offer makes it clear to Alice what you're willing to pay. Now it's up to her to decide if she's willing to go that low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $9,500, which is a significant amount above your $8,000 limit and John's offer. Going with John ensures you stay within budget."
