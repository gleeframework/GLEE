"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 130} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  It's generally good to start negotiations above your desired price to leave room for bargaining. 
* **Anchor the price:** By starting at $130, I am setting a high initial point which may influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 
* **Gauge Bob's response:** This initial offer will give me insight into how much Bob is willing to pay and how aggressive he'll be in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. My maximum budget is $85 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is too low, and accepting it would mean a significant loss. While his message suggests a ""maximum budget,"" it's likely a negotiation tactic.  I'll counter-offer in the next round to try and close the gap.  I'm still willing to negotiate as selling to John only nets me $100, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While that's a lower price than I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $115. I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations, and I'm ready to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 115}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** I'm lowering my price significantly from the initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate.
* **Hold firm (for now):**  I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum ($100) and significantly above Bob's offer. 
* **Positive language:** I continue to emphasize the product's value to encourage Bob towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches what John is offering. There's no further incentive to negotiate or hold out for a higher price with Bob, as I risk him lowering his offer or walking away in future rounds.  Accepting $100 now guarantees the best possible outcome."
