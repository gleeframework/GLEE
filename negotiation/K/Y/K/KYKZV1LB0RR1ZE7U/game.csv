"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to start with this number.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 would be undervaluing the product significantly.  Could we consider $1,025,000? This demonstrates movement on my end while still reflecting the true worth of what I'm offering.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $950,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, so I hope we can find a compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground. How about $987,500? This reflects a significant compromise on my part while acknowledging the value you see in the product.",987500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $987,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I can only go up to $950,000. I hope we can find a final agreement at this price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
