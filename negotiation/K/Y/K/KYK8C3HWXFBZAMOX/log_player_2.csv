"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Be polite and express interest:** Maintaining a positive tone can encourage continued negotiation.
* **Substantially lower the price:** Starting lower gives room for negotiation and tests Alice's willingness to come down significantly. 
* **Leave room for compromise:**  Even if Alice rejects $90, there's space to meet in the middle between $90 and her initial $110 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $110 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice came down a bit, we're still not at our target price. Let's see if we can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?"",
""product_price"": 97.50
}
```

Reasoning:

* **Acknowledge the compromise:** Showing appreciation for Alice's willingness to negotiate helps maintain a positive atmosphere.
* **Propose a specific middle ground:** Suggesting $97.50 makes it clear that we're willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to our initial offer.
* **Maintain a firm stance:** We're getting close to John's price, so we need to be assertive without being aggressive to signal that this is a serious offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $105. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I can offer you the product for $102.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reasoning:

* **Reached the negotiation limit:** Alice seems firm on not going below $102.50. 
* **Marginal difference:** The potential savings from further haggling with Alice ($2.50) are likely not worth the additional time and effort.
* **Guaranteed price with John:** Buying from John ensures we get the product at our target price of $100.

It's been a good negotiation attempt with Alice, but it's time to make a decision and secure the product at the best available price."
