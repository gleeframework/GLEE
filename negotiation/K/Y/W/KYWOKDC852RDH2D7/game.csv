"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking for a fair deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns about the product's value, Alice, but I still think we're far apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and understand this is your top price. I've tried to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $1,000,000.  To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions, and I'm willing to make a final offer of $1,200,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal with you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
