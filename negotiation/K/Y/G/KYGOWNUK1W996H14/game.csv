"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. How about $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $775,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value.",775000.0,Alice,5,
