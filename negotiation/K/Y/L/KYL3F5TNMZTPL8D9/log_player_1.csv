"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really love! I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but it also leaves some room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and optimistic in my message to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $130. This still gives me a good profit, but also makes it a fair deal for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm counteroffering with a price of $130. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway. I'm still getting a decent price, but it's also more attractive to Bob than my previous offer. My message is still friendly and encouraging, hoping to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $130 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price. Even though I could sell to John for the same price, there's a chance I could get a higher offer from Bob in the next round. However, there's also a risk that he could back out or offer even less. To avoid that risk and secure the minimum profit, I'll accept Bob's offer."
