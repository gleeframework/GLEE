"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

The product is worth $150 to Alice and she is offering it for $180, which is already more than her valuation. This is not a good deal for you. There's no reason to accept this offer. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is the maximum you're willing to pay, and it's a good starting point for negotiation. It's also less than Alice's valuation of $150, making it a potential win-win situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $160 is still higher than your maximum valuation of $120.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $120, there's no reason to continue negotiating with Alice."
