Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my offer accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering with $175. This is still higher than my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate.  It's a compromise, and I hope Bob will see it as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price, but I can sell to John for the same amount. This is a no-brainer.  I'll sell to John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
