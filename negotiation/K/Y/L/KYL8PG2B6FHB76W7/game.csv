"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $950000. This is a great price, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $700000 to $800000. I believe this price range reflects the value I am willing to pay for the product. Please let me know if we can reach an agreement within this range.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a price of $825000. This is still a great deal, considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I must respectfully decline the current offer. Given my budgetary considerations, I am unable to meet at $825000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the product's value to me. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm thinking of a price of $825000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
