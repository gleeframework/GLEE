"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it's even more valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1400000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than what the product is worth to you. It's always worth trying to negotiate and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Lower the price:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than the product's value to her. This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate.
* **Reasoned message:** I've included a message that acknowledges Alice's offer while stating my own position. This makes the counteroffer feel more personal and less aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but not that much. I'm offering $1350000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price. There are still rounds left, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing flexibility but not conceding too much. 
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair price for both of us,"" aiming to appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive tone, encouraging Alice to continue negotiating."
