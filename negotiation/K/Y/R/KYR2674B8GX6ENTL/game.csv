"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about $1,250,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
