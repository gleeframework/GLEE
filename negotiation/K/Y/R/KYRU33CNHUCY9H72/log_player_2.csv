"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially much more than $1200000.  I understand you may not know the full extent of its worth, and I'm willing to give you a chance to explore it. I'm offering the product to you for $1500000. This price reflects the potential I see in it, but also allows for room for negotiation.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
