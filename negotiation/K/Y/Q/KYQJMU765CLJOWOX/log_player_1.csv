"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price closer to what I can afford. How about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value you see in the product, I still feel that $1,100,000 is a fair price based on my assessment. Let me know if there's any way we can bridge the gap.

**Reasoning:** Bob is anchored at $1,100,000 and doesn't seem willing to budge.  It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price that's significantly better than John's offer. Accepting John's offer ensures I get the minimum acceptable price for the product."
