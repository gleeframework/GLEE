You can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $10,500 isn't enough for me to let go of the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

You're still above your desired budget. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target price before buying from John."
