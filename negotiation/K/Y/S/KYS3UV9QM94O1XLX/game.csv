"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you considering me. I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but unfortunately, $10,500 isn't enough for me to let go of the product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $11,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,250 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
