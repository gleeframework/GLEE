"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Since the product is worth $800,000 to you, and you have the option to buy it from John for that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the same product at the same price from John."
