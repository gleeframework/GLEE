Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

Since I know Bob values the product at $800,000, offering him the product for that price is the best way to maximize my earnings. This ensures I get the full value and avoids any potential loss if he rejects the offer.  While I could try to negotiate a higher price, there's no guarantee he'll accept, and I'd be risking selling to John at a lower price."
