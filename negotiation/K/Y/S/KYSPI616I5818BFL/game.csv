"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. Could we meet in the middle at $10,250? This product truly offers exceptional value, and I wouldn't want you to miss out.",10250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a compromise to make it work.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I aim to find a price that works for both of us, I can't go as low as $9,800.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $10,025? This is a significant discount from my original offer, reflecting my desire to close the deal.",10025.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,750? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more compromise to make it work.",9750.0,Bob,6,
