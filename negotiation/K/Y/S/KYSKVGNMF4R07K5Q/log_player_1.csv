Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While Bob only values the product at $120, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A price of $135 leaves some wiggle room if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **Above our Minimum:**  Importantly, this price is still comfortably above our minimum of $150 (since we can sell to John at that price). This ensures we're always making a profit."
