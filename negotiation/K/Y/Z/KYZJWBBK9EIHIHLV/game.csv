"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counteroffer at $105 for the product.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $107.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",107.5,Alice,5,
