"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum value of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $12,000, he has room to negotiate while still getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value.  I will reject it and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a slight decrease from my initial offer, but still above my minimum. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to even lower offers. To avoid risking losing out on a better price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000."
