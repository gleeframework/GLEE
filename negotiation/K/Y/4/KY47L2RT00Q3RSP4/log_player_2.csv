"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you a fair price of $15,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget and what you know John will sell for.  It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $6,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's important to start with a counteroffer that reflects your target price range. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Expressing Interest:**  The message emphasizes your interest in the product but makes it clear that the current price is a dealbreaker. 
* **Leaving Room for Movement:**  By suggesting a price ""closer to $6,000,"" you signal some flexibility, which might encourage Alice to counter with a more reasonable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I have to make a living too. I can see you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down slightly, $12,000 is still above your maximum budget and equal to her perceived value.  There's no reason for you to take this offer.
* **""Lowest I can go"" is a Tactic:**  Experienced negotiators know that claiming this is often a bluff to try and force your hand. Don't be swayed by it. 
* **John's Offer is Appealing:**  The longer this drags on, the more attractive John's guaranteed $8,000 offer becomes.  It's time to push Alice a bit harder or walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still more than I can spend.  I could go up to $7,000, but that's really pushing my budget to the limit.  Do you think we can make a deal work at that price?"", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing Incrementally:** Moving from $6,000 to $7,000 shows willingness to compromise, but not too much too quickly.
* **Firm But Fair Tone:**  The message aims to be polite but firm, emphasizing your budget constraints while still seeking a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Testing Alice's Resolve:** This counteroffer will reveal if Alice is genuinely willing to negotiate or if she's stuck on her valuation.
* **Nearing the Walk-Away Point:**  You're getting close to the price where John's deal makes more sense. Alice needs to move significantly in the next round or two."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $7,000. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and $12,000, which is $9,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While $9,500 is closer, it's still above your $8,000 maximum and a long way from your initial offer.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  Again, this is a common negotiation tactic to try to force your hand.  Don't let it pressure you.
* **Time to Signal Your Alternative:**  Alice needs to know you're serious about walking away.  By rejecting this offer, you show her you're willing to go to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $9,500 is just not feasible for me.  Honestly, I've got another offer for this product at a significantly lower price.  I'd prefer to work with you, but I'm only willing to pay up to $7,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", 
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Hold Firm but Fair:** You're sticking close to your previous offer, showing you're willing to negotiate but not be pushed around.
* **Introduce the Alternative:** By mentioning you have another offer (without revealing the price), you create urgency and a reason for Alice to be more flexible.
* **Final Offer (For Real):** This is essentially your last attempt to get Alice down to a price you'll accept.  If she doesn't budge significantly, you'll likely go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you've got another offer, but I'm not willing to sell at $7,500. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, which is still a discount from my original offer. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is clearly not going to meet your $8,000 limit. She's only dropped $500 from her last offer and is still using the ""final offer"" tactic.
* **John's Deal is Secure:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $8,000. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Alice when you have a sure thing.
* **Time is Valuable:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a significantly better outcome. Taking John's offer now saves time and potential frustration."
