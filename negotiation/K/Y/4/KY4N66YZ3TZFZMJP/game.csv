"Hi Alice, thanks for reaching out. While I appreciate the value of the product, your asking price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it. Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $14,000. I think this price is more in line with the value you'll get from the product, and it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Could we agree on $12,000? That would be a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you've come down a bit, and I appreciate that. To be honest,  $12,500 is the highest I can go.  Take it or leave it.",12500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm not surprised you're trying to push the price down, but I'm still not willing to sell at $12,500. I'll make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,750. This is my absolute final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options. What do you say?",13750.0,Alice,7,
