"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125?  That gives you a good deal, and it's still within my price range."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we split the difference and settle on $117? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $117 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the price will keep going down, and I might end up with a worse deal.  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me my minimum, so it's the safer option."
