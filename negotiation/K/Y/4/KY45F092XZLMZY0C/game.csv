"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. I believe this reflects its true worth. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to be flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I understand your budget considerations, and I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us.  How about $11,000? That's my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for sticking with this.  You say $11,000 is your final offer, but to be honest, John is offering me the same thing for $10,000. If you can match that, the deal is yours.",10000.0,Bob,6,
