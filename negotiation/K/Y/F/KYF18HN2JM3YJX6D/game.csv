"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity. However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $115? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. I'm still a bit hesitant about $125.  How about $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",120.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $125.50. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",125.5,Alice,5,
