{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This is a starting offer that is still above Bob's value of $80, but also lower than your minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives you room to negotiate and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $80 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $90.  This would still give you a good deal, and allows me to make a little profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. John is offering a guaranteed $120, which is a much better deal for me. I'm going to sell the product to John."
