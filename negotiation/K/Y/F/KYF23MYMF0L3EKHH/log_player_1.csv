Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a unique chance to acquire an asset that would be highly beneficial to you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium over his perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation but still secures a significant profit above John's offer.
* **Confident Messaging:** The language is framed to emphasize the product's value and exclusivity, potentially influencing Bob's perception and willingness to pay a higher price. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
