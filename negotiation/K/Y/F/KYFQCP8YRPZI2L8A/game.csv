"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to make a counteroffer of $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the value of this product to the right buyer is truly significant. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
