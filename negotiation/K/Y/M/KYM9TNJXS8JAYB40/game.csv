"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this time.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $1,050,000?  I'm confident this price is fair and allows us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,050,000. How about we try $950,000? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  Let's aim for a final compromise.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
