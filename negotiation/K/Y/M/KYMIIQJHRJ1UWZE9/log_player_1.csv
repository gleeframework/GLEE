Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in this product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,300,000. This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it holds for me. I believe this price point allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.
