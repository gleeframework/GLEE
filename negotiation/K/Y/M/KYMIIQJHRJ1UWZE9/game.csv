"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  To start the conversation, I propose a price of $2,000,000. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. However, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in this product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,300,000. This would give us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,000,000 represents the high end of the product's value, I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true worth of what's being offered. ",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential benefits it holds for me. I believe this price point allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
