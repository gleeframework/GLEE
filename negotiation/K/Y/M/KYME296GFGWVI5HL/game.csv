"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500.  This gives you a significant advantage over the market value while ensuring I receive a fair price.  Let me know if you're interested!",12500.0,Alice,1,
