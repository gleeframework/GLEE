"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that I believe will be of significant value to your business.  I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its worth and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Please consider this carefully, as I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or, if unsuccessful, fall back on buying from John."
