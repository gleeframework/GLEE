"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love this product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $105? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $108. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
