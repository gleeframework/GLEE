"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is quite high for my budget. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for the product. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could we meet somewhere around $12,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're close to a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, so I hope we can shake hands on it.",13000.0,Alice,7,
