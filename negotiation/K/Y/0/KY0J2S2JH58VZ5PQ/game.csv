"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to make a significant profit while still being a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm willing to move forward with the deal if we can agree on this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 still falls short of my bottom line. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $975,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise for both of us. If you're serious about buying, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
