"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $875,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal quickly. ",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $887,500, but that's as low as I can go. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",887500.0,Alice,5,
