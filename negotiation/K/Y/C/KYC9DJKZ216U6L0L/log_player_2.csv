"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. This is a great deal for a product worth $15000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a cheaper price from John ($15,000), so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $13000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,500, which is still a good deal for you, as it's less than what you'd pay John.  It's also a fair price for Alice, as she's willing to sell for more than her value."
