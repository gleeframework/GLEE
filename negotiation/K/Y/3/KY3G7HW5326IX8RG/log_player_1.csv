Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your fallback option.
* **Justification for the price:**  Mentioning ""its worth and potential"" subtly implies the product is valuable and justifies the higher price without revealing your minimum. 
* **Open for negotiation:** The tone of the message leaves the door open for Bob to negotiate.  He may be willing to pay close to your asking price, or you can adjust based on his response.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while considering Bob's potential acceptance."
