"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your own value for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction quickly.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
