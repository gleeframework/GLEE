"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $135?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $135 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $160 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably spend.  Would you consider $145?  It's closer to my budget and still allows for a profit on your end.",145.0,Bob,4,
