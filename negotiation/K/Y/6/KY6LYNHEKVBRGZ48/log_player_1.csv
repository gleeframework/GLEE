"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This is a starting offer that is still higher than Bob's value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to secure a price closer to my own value while still remaining competitive and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have some room to maneuver."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,800 is closer to my minimum value, I still think I can get a better price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, as I have several rounds left.  Selling to John is always an option, but I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,800 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $9,000? This feels like a fair compromise, and it would allow me to sell the product without going too far below my target."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to make a fair compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,900? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,900 is getting close to my minimum value, I'm still hopeful I can squeeze out a bit more.  With only 4 rounds left, it's getting risky, but I'm going to see if I can get Bob to come up to $9,000.  If he rejects again, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $8,900 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, so how about we settle at $8,950?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and it would allow us to finally close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8950}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,900, but I was thinking maybe we could discuss other concessions, such as including some extras or services with the purchase. Can we talk about that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm unlikely to get a better price from Bob, and I'm running out of time. It's better to sell to John and secure the full $12,000 than risk losing both John and a decent price with Bob."
