"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,450,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation and still gives Bob a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, it's still below my ideal price. I want to see if I can get closer to my goal of $1,450,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,400,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still giving me a good profit.  Hopefully, this will be acceptable to Bob, as it's closer to my initial offer than his."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's tempting to take John's offer, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}
```

I'm offering $1,375,000. It's a bit lower than my previous offer, but it's still above John's offer and closer to Bob's last offer.  This is a good compromise to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm only three rounds away from selling to John, so I'll see if I can get a better deal by rejecting Bob's offer and making one last counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1325000}
```

I'm offering $1,325,000. This is a significant concession, but it's still above John's offer and I'm feeling the pressure of limited rounds. I'm hoping this final attempt will convince Bob to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, and Bob's offer being only slightly higher than John's, it's time to cut my losses. I'll sell to John for $1,200,000 to secure a sale and avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
