"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $9,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $8,500, so I'm thinking $7,250. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider that?",7250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm trying to be reasonable here. I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. ",8000.0,Alice,7,
