"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10800. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9800.0,Bob,6,
