"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. My initial offer for the product is $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We can definitely negotiate a better price than $1,200,000. Let's see if Alice is willing to come down a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 

**Reasoning:** Starting with a counter-offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price leaves room for negotiation while still staying within a reasonable range of the product's value to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

We're making progress, but there's still room to negotiate. Alice is coming down, and we can use that to our advantage in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you closer to your price. How about $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're increasing our offer, signaling to Alice that we're serious about the purchase. 
* **Knowing Their Bottom Line:** Offering Alice her product's value to her ($1,000,000) might be tempting enough for her to accept, especially as we're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* **Avoiding John's Price:** We're still significantly below John's $1,500,000 price, making continued negotiation with Alice the better option for now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,000,000, so my new offer is $1,050,000. I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  $1,050,000 is a solid price, well below John's offer and a significant savings from Alice's initial offer.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds. While we *might* be able to get the price lower, there's a risk Alice won't budge much further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential savings from further negotiation are becoming smaller, and the risk of losing the deal altogether increases if we push too hard. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk overplaying our hand and ending up with John's less favorable offer."
