# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget.  It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $18,000 is closer to its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?

While $15,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum of $12,000. You can continue to negotiate and potentially get a better deal. Rejecting this offer allows you to make another counteroffer and try to reach a more acceptable price."
