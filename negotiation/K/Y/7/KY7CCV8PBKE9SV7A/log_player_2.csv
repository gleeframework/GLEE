You should reject Alice's offer. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is $120. This leaves room for negotiation to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. However, I would like to propose an offer of $110 for the product. This is the highest price I can offer while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

Alice has come down to $110, which is still a good deal for you since you are willing to pay up to $150. Accepting this offer saves you $40 compared to buying from John."
