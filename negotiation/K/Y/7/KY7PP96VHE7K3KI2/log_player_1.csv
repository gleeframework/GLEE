Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** Offering $12,000 is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Negotiation flexibility:**  This price gives me a buffer to potentially lower the price if Bob makes a counteroffer, while still allowing me to earn more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **John as a safety net:**  The knowledge that John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me confidence to negotiate with Bob without feeling pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to consider $9,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even my initial offer of $12,000.  Accepting it would be a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob is trying to push for a low price, there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground.
* **John's offer provides security:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 allows me to hold firm and not settle for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial offer. How about $11,000?  It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  $11,000 is a compromise between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not settle for an unfair price.
* **Highlighting the value:**  The message emphasizes that $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob, making the offer more appealing.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's initial offer and counteroffering with a higher price, I'm showing him I'm not desperate to sell and have alternative options (John's offer)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're willing to come down, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. Would you be willing to consider $10,200 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $10,200 is still lower than my initial desired price, it's only slightly below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag on and potentially result in a lower price or even a breakdown in negotiations.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me the security to accept this offer without feeling pressured.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale close to my minimum acceptable price and avoid the risk of further negotiation potentially resulting in a worse outcome."
