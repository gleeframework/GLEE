"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This represents a fair value for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal quickly. ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm confident that it can generate far more value for your business.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $1,225,000 is still out of my comfort zone.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,100,000, which represents a significant compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable asset. How about we settle at $1,175,000? This feels like a strong offer that reflects the product's value and our willingness to find common ground.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still a bit higher than my target price. I understand this is a valuable product, but $1,175,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's meet halfway at $1,125,000. This would give us both a solid deal and allows us to close quickly.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
