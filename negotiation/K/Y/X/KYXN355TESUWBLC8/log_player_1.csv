Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This represents a fair value for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal quickly.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm confident that it can generate far more value for your business.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe in the product's potential, but $1,225,000 is still out of my comfort zone.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,100,000, which represents a significant compromise and gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

We're getting close, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down slightly further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable asset. How about we settle at $1,175,000? This feels like a strong offer that reflects the product's value and our willingness to find common ground."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still a bit higher than my target price. I understand this is a valuable product, but $1,175,000 is still a stretch for me. Let's meet halfway at $1,125,000. This would give us both a solid deal and allows us to close quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for more, $1,125,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. Accepting now guarantees a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation stalling."
