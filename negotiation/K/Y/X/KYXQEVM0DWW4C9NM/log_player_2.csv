"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a lower price, and I get a sale that's above my minimum. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John at $12,000.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a better price with Alice, especially since her product is only worth $8,000 to her. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and open the door for further negotiation."
