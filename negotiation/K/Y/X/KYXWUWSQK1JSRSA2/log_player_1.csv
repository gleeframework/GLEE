Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $20,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm afraid $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is equal to John's offer. There's no benefit to further negotiation.
