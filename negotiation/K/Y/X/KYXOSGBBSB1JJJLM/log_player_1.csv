"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good starting point and leaving room for negotiation. While I'm willing to sell to John for $1,000,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I want to see if I can push for a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm aiming for a middle ground, proposing $1,000,000. This price is still above Bob's initial counteroffer, but it's closer to what I'm willing to accept. It's important to maintain some leverage while also demonstrating a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to his perceived value of the product, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. It's important to hold firm on my boundaries and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm making a slight concession, lowering the price to $950,000. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still keeping the price above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will entice him to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting increasingly difficult, and it's unlikely Bob will budge much further. The time cost of continuing to negotiate outweighs the potential benefit of a slightly higher price. Selling to John guarantees a $1,000,000 profit, which is closer to my ideal price and secures a certain outcome."
