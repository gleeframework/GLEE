Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe you'll find it to be a great value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $140 is a strong starting point, it leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down slightly.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $100 gives us a strong fallback position. We don't want to go below this price with Bob."
