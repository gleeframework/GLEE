"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, but it also shows that I value the product highly.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $12,000. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and it leaves some room for compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see the value and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not satisfied with the deal. I believe I can get a better price, especially since there are still 6 rounds left. I will reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $11,000. This shows that I'm willing to be flexible, but still maintain a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable value.  Hopefully, this will be a sweet spot that Bob will be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate further. I have 4 more rounds before I need to make a decision about John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $10,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to reach a deal. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value, and with only 3 rounds left, I need to start closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm not sure I can push Bob up to my desired price. Since John is offering $12,000, which is my minimum, I'll take the guaranteed deal and sell the product to him."
