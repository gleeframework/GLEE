"Hi Alice, $190 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120 for it. Let me know if you're open to that.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your interest.  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $155?",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $155 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $137.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",137.5,Bob,4,
