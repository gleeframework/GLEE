"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. While it's a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,500 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can still get a better price.  The product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's still some room for negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. How about $11,000? It's a fair deal for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll sell the product to you for $11250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $15000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could technically try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice is firm on this price.  Accepting the offer at $11,250 is still a significantly better deal than buying from John for $15,000. Bob saves a considerable amount of money and gets a good deal."
