"Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 falls short of what I had in mind. This product offers significant value that I believe justifies a higher price point. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $2,050,000? This reflects my desire to make a deal while acknowledging the value proposition of this product.",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to meet you at $2,050,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,900,000, but that's as high as I'm comfortable going. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value of this product, and I respect your perspective on the market. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $1,975,000? This represents a significant concession on my part while ensuring a fair deal for both sides.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,975,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions.",1950000.0,Bob,6,
