"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer is way above my budget and Alice's starting price is significantly inflated. It's worth negotiating further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than my actual budget to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Justification:** Offering a low price needs some justification to avoid completely derailing the negotiation. I've kept it simple and implied I see this as a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $14,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** While Alice came down, it's not a substantial move. At this pace, we might not reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.
* **Alternative Exists:**  The option to buy from John for $10,000 is a strong motivator to aim for a price significantly closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a reasonable compromise."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a price that represents a more significant move on my part to show willingness to negotiate, but it's still below my maximum budget.
* **Time Constraint:**  We are now past the halfway point in the negotiation, so it's essential to make more substantial moves towards a potential agreement.
* **Justification:** Using the phrase ""meet in the middle"" is a common negotiation tactic to encourage agreement and make the offer seem more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go any lower than $13,000.  This is a substantial product with real value, and $13,000 is a very fair price. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While $13,000 is closer, it's still above my $10,000 limit.
* **Pressure Tactic:** Alice is trying to create urgency (""Let's close this deal""), but I still have time and the John option. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's firm tone doesn't necessarily mean she won't budge further.  I'll counter to see if there's any flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, to be honest, $13,000 is still pushing my budget. I could potentially make $11,800 work, but that's absolutely my limit."",
""product_price"": 11800
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm making a smaller concession this time ($100 less than my previous offer) to signal that I'm reaching my limit.
* **Honesty and Transparency:**  Telling Alice that $11,800 is my absolute limit adds a sense of urgency and seriousness to the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Alice:** While I'm being firm, I haven't completely shut down the negotiation. There's a slight chance Alice might make a final move to meet my price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? This is my final offer. Let's finalize this deal and get it done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has declared this her ""final offer,"" and while it might not be entirely true, it signals she's unlikely to move much further.
* **Too Far Apart:** $12,500 is still significantly over my $10,000 budget.  The potential savings of $2,500 outweigh the risk of continuing to negotiate.
* **Time to Walk Away:** With only a few rounds left, it's better to secure the product from John at my target price than risk Alice not coming down enough."
