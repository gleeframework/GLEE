"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price.  It's better to reject and make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product, but I'm only willing to pay $11,500 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $11500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12500 to meet you halfway.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, it's still above his goal.  Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price, aiming for something closer to $12,000. There's always a risk Alice might walk away, but if Bob can secure the product for a price closer to his limit, it's worth the risk."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a little hesitant at $12,500.  How about $12,250?  That's a good compromise, and it's the highest I can go right now."", ""product_price"": 12250}
