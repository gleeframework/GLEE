Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $65 is better than nothing, I'm holding out for a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $75?  I'm sure you'll agree that's a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $70? That's a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $70. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure a sale at a slightly lower price than to hold out for a higher price and end up with nothing."
