"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair price. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to make this work. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,750 is still a bit too low.  How about $8,900?  This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I'm open to discussing further, but I need to get closer to $9,000 to make this deal work.",8900.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",8800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,800 just isn't going to work for me. How about $8,850? This is my final offer. I'm willing to take a little less to get this deal done, but I can't go any lower.  Let me know what you think.",8850.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,850 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $8,850, so I'll offer $8,825. That's the best I can do.",8825.0,Bob,8,
