Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go down to $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you is $15,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer. It's better to accept a small win than risk losing out entirely."
