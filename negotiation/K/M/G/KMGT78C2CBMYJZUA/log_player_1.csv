I'm starting with an offer of $17,000. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers. I also have the option of selling to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

I'm counteroffering at $16,500. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will be acceptable to him, but if not, I'll still have the option of selling to John for $15,000."

Bob is firm on his price, and I've already lowered my offer. It's clear we're not going to agree on a higher price, so it's time to take the safe option. I'll sell to John for $15,000.  While it's not my ideal outcome, it's still a good deal and ensures a quick sale."
