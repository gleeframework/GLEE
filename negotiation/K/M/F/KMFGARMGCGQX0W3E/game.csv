"Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $17,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it. Let's make a deal.",17500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you want to get closer to your initial price, but $19,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $18,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",18000.0,Bob,4,
