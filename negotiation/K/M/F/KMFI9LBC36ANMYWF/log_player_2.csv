"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price, but he's still showing interest in the product. This gives him room to negotiate and allows Alice to consider a lower price without completely rejecting the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell it to you for $16000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum budget, but it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal. He can afford to wait since he has 10 rounds to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $12,000, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now pushing for his maximum budget, hoping that Alice will either accept or make a counteroffer close to his price. He's being firm but polite, indicating his serious interest in the product while leaving room for a slight compromise from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $14000. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, but it's still a bit high. Bob has already established his maximum budget of $12,000, and rejecting this offer shows he's serious about getting the best possible price. There are still five rounds left, and it's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price. However, I'm still not able to go above $12,000. It's my maximum budget, and I'm really hoping we can find a way to make this work. Maybe we can split the difference? How about $13,000? "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is sticking to his maximum budget but is showing willingness to compromise by suggesting a middle ground. This maintains his position while demonstrating flexibility and encouraging Alice to make a final concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your creative suggestion to split the difference. However, I'm still not willing to go below $14000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll offer it to you for $13500. This is my final concession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, but it's still above it. With only three rounds left, it's not worth risking losing the opportunity to buy the product at his maximum budget. Buying from John at $12,000 ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
