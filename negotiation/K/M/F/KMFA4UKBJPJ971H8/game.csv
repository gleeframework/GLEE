"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, say around $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still trying to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,025,000. I propose a price of $962,500. Can you consider this offer?",962500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $962,500 is closer to what I need, it's still a significant gap for me.  How about we land at $1,000,000 even? This offer demonstrates my willingness to find a compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable going above $962,500. I'm willing to meet you at $995,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Can you consider this offer?",995000.0,Bob,6,
