Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice has come down in price, her ""final offer"" of $850,000 is still higher than John's offer of $800,000.  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and it makes more sense to secure the product at the best known price."
