"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to both of us, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both parties. I'm willing to start at $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate, and Alice seems open to finding a price that works for both.  Rejecting allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is too far below my valuation. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's compromise at $1,025,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** There are still 7 rounds left, giving Bob time to potentially push for a lower price. 
* **Jhon is a backup:**  Bob can always buy from Jhon if the negotiation falls through, so there's no urgency to accept a price that's too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's try $975,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. Let's split the difference and meet at $1,000,000. This price ensures both of us get a good value. It's the best compromise I can offer without losing too much. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget:** While Bob would prefer a lower price, $1,000,000 is within his maximum spending limit.
* **Further negotiation is risky:** With only 5 rounds left, there's a chance Bob might not be able to negotiate a lower price.  
* **Jhon is a backup:** Bob can still buy from Jhon, but Alice's offer is significantly cheaper.
* **Potential for future negotiations:**  Even though Bob is accepting the offer, he could potentially negotiate a lower price in the future if the product has lower value than expected."
