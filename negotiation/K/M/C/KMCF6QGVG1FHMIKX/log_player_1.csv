"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is still a decent profit, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $1,200,000 by continuing negotiations.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's try $975,000. This is a good compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my target, I'm still not at a price I'm comfortable with. I'll counter with a price that's more appealing to me, while still allowing for some flexibility. I'm aiming to close the gap and secure a deal that's closer to $1,200,000."
