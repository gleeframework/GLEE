"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but $500000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $1250000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I understand your position and the value you place on the product. My budget constraints still prevent me from reaching the $1250000 mark. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750000. I hope this proposal is more in line with what we can agree upon.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, $750000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $1000000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
