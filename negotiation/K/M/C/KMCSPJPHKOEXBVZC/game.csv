"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it from me for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I can offer you a compromise at $115. I think you'll find it's a fair price for this amazing product!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a little out of my budget.  Let's try $112.50. It's a good middle ground and closer to where I need to be.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with the price. I can meet you at $114, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great value for the product, and I think you'll love it!",114.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $114 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $113. That's a fair compromise for both of us.",113.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're really close now, Bob! I can see you're willing to make a deal, and I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $114 is a bit of a stretch, but I can do $113.50. That's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product!",113.5,Alice,7,
