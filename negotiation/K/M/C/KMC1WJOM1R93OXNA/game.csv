,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate your enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm open to further negotiations if you're willing to compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $105?  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still being within my budget.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer it to you for $107.50. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product's value.",107.5,Alice,5,
