"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. If that works for you, we have a deal.",95.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept $95. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $100. This is my final offer.",100.0,Alice,5,,
