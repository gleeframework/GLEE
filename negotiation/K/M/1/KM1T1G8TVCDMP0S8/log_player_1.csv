"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product! I believe it's worth $1,200,000 to you, considering its potential.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the product's worth to Bob, encouraging him to see its value and potentially justify a higher price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, setting the stage for a back-and-forth process.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize profit, but I also need to be mindful of the 10-round limit and the possibility of selling to John. By starting high and demonstrating flexibility, I hope to reach a mutually beneficial agreement with Bob before time runs out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your suggestion. However, given my budget constraints, I am willing to pay up to $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to push for a better deal.  I'm confident that I can secure a more favorable price in the remaining rounds, given Bob's clear interest and his willingness to increase his offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I'm not satisfied with the current offer, and I believe I can push for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Leveraging Time:**  I have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can reach a better agreement by continuing the negotiation. 
* **Assessing Risk:**  While selling to John for $800,000 is an option, it's a risky move.  If I continue with Bob, I have a greater chance of securing a significantly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $950,000 is a bit below where I need to be.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. I believe this price still represents a good value for you, and it allows us both to move forward. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable outcome.
* **Reiterating Value:** I emphasize the value the product offers to Bob, reminding him that even with a higher price, it's still a worthwhile investment.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a win-win situation, highlighting that it allows both of us to move forward with a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintaining Momentum:** My goal is to keep the negotiation moving forward by offering a reasonable counteroffer that signals flexibility and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Minimizing Risk:** By keeping the price relatively high, I'm reducing the risk of accepting a significantly lower offer or having to resort to selling to John.
* **Building Trust:**  This counteroffer aims to build trust with Bob by demonstrating a willingness to find a middle ground, paving the way for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I value your flexibility. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose a price of $1,025,000 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, I believe I can still push for a better deal. The product is worth significantly more to him, and I'm confident I can secure a higher price with a few more rounds of negotiation.

**Strategy:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** I'm not satisfied with the current offer, and I believe I can push for a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Leveraging Time:** I still have 6 rounds left, and I'm confident that I can reach a better agreement by continuing the negotiation.
* **Assessing Risk:**  While selling to John for $800,000 is an option, it's still a risky move as it means walking away from a potentially more lucrative deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, continuing to signal my willingness to negotiate while also seeking to maximize my profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your ongoing willingness to negotiate. While I recognize your budget constraints, I believe that $1,025,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you.  Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be mutually beneficial.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Staying Firm:** While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm aiming to secure a price closer to my initial proposal.
* **Strategic Compromise:** By meeting Bob halfway again, I demonstrate flexibility while still holding firm to my desired price point.
* **Reiterating Value:** I subtly remind Bob of the significant value this product holds for him, hoping to persuade him to see the worth of a slightly higher price. 
* **Framing for Success:** I'm reframing the counteroffer as a win-win situation, creating a positive outlook for a successful agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** This counteroffer aims to keep the price high and increase my potential profit.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By refusing to accept Bob's offer, I signal that I'm in a strong position and not willing to settle for a significantly lower price. 
* **Closing the Gap:**  The offer aims to narrow the gap between our desired prices, creating the possibility of reaching an agreement in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest proposal, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. Given my financial situation and the current market, I would like to propose a final price of $1,030,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise for both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,030,000 is very close to my desired price point.  Considering that we're nearing the end of the negotiation process (only 4 rounds left), and the possibility of having to sell to John for a much lower price, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice. 

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing Risk:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a decent profit and eliminates the risk of losing out on a deal altogether. 
* **Time Factor:** With limited rounds remaining, there is a higher risk of the negotiation collapsing, potentially forcing me to sell to John for a significantly lower price.
* **Close Enough:** While I would prefer a slightly higher price, $1,030,000 is a good compromise that allows me to secure a favorable outcome without risking a much lower deal."
