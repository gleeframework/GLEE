Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm asking for $1,450,000, which reflects its true worth and potential.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price slightly below your guaranteed amount allows for some back-and-forth if Bob wants to negotiate. 
* **High but Justifiable:** $1,450,000 is a high price, but the message emphasizes the product's value and aims to justify the cost.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have time for a potential negotiation with Bob. If you need to sell quickly, offering a price closer to $1,500,000 might be a safer bet."
