"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $850,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000?  That feels like a good compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
