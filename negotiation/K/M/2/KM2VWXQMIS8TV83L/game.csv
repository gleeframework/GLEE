"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm looking to pay a bit less for this product. How about we start with $1250000?  This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise at $1320000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",1320000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1320000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1275000. This price is closer to our target and would be a fair deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work. ",1275000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you halfway between $1275000 and $1320000. I'll offer it to you for $1295000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1295000.0,Alice,5,
