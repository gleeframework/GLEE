"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I believe the product's value justifies my initial offer, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,100,000. This price still provides significant value for you while allowing me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between the value provided by the product and my financial constraints. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  The product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will pay for itself quickly for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
