Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm not willing to settle for $8,800 yet. I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'll try to negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $8,800 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $9,150. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,150 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

While I'd love to get closer to my initial price, Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer.  It's a good compromise and a solid deal.  I'll accept it."
