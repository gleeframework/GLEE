"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I do like the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $110. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $155. It's still a great deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $130? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a fair price for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle at $142.50? It's still a great deal, and I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",142.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we split the difference one last time and settle at $136?",136.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, though. How about we settle at $140? It's still a bit above my minimum, but I think it's a fair compromise.",140.0,Alice,7,
