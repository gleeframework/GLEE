{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$115:**  This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $100, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  A friendly and persuasive message is important. It highlights the value of the product and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize your earnings:**  $115 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers.
* **Keep John as a safety net:** The threat of selling to John for $120 provides leverage if negotiations with Bob become too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $105?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a good starting point for negotiation, $105 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:**  You have a clear opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your desired range. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain control of the negotiation and signal that you're willing to hold out for a better price. This also keeps John as a viable backup option if negotiations with Bob fail."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between your initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Message:**  The message reaffirms your appreciation for Bob's interest and emphasizes the product's value while offering a fair price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain your position:**  $110 is still a profitable price for you, keeping you above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Signal flexibility:** By lowering your price slightly, you show a willingness to negotiate.
* **Maximize chances of agreement:**  This counteroffer is more likely to be accepted by Bob, given that it's closer to his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $108? I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, $108 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity for counteroffer:** You can still try to negotiate a higher price, as Bob seems genuinely interested and you haven't yet reached your minimum acceptable price. 

**Strategy:**

* By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain control and show that you're serious about getting a better deal.
* This also keeps John as a backup option if the negotiation fails."
