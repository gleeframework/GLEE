Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to me, leaving room for negotiation. I believe $1,750,000 is a fair starting point, as it reflects the value the product holds for Bob.  This leaves us both with a potential for profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation. I will counteroffer to keep the deal alive and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, while still aiming for a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.  Further negotiation with Bob carries the risk of going even lower or a prolonged process, so it's best to secure the guaranteed profit with John."
