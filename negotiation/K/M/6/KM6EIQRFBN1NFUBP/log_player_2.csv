"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by counteroffering. There's a significant gap between Alice's value ($1,000,000) and her offer ($1,400,000), indicating room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation. It also shows Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,300,000, which is closer to your desired price point and still leaves you some room for profit. It's a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,500,000. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice walking away or you losing time and potentially missing out on the product makes accepting the offer the best course of action."
