I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum price of $1,500,000, but still allows me to make a profit. I'm hoping Bob will accept the offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,300,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but I still believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm ready to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum price, I don't think I'm going to be able to get significantly more from him. John is offering me my minimum price, so it's the most logical choice."
