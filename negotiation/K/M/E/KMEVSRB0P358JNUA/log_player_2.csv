{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  It's always worth trying to negotiate with Alice, even if it means a few rounds of back and forth.  You can potentially save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This sets a clear limit for Alice and makes it obvious that I'm serious about getting a good deal. If Alice rejects this offer, we can then start a negotiation to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price point.  It's worth continuing the negotiation process.  I believe I can likely get Alice to come down further."

{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $1,000,000 to $1,100,000. This shows that I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a good deal.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Alice to accept, but if not, we can continue negotiating."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm getting closer to my goal. I'm not ready to accept yet and believe I can still negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again to $1,150,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am still trying to get the best price possible. It's a reasonable middle ground between our previous offers, and hopefully, it will be enough to persuade Alice to accept."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, I'm still determined to get a better price. I believe there's still room for negotiation. If I can push her down just a little more, I'll be able to get a better deal than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer to $1,175,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, showing Alice I'm still serious but not willing to go much higher. It's a good compromise point, and hopefully, it will be enough for Alice to accept. If not, we can continue the negotiation, but I'm getting close to my maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,212,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,212,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but I'm starting to feel like we're stuck in a stalemate. It seems like we might just keep going back and forth.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 will guarantee I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with, and I don't want to risk further negotiation delays."
