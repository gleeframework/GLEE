Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price. 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, so offering the product for anything less than $1,500,000 to Bob makes sense. Since you have a fallback option, you can afford to start with a higher offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Considering its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal given its unique benefits."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity.""
* **Strong Starting Point:**  $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while securing a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""potential value"" and ""unique benefits"" subtly reminds Bob why it's worth a premium price.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good long-term relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly more moderate opening price could be considered.

**Remember:**  This is just the opening move. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters, but always keep your minimum price in mind."
