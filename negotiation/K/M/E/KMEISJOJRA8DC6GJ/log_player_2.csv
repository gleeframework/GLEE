"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so any price below that is better for you. It's worth seeing if you can negotiate with Alice to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $10,000, and it still leaves room for Alice to make a profit since her value is $8,000.  This counteroffer demonstrates that you are serious about negotiating while also giving Alice a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer is closer to your desired price, it's still higher than your ideal price point. It's worth trying one more round of counteroffers to see if you can get a better deal.  You're still better off than buying from John, as you are getting a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a compromise.  It's higher than your first counteroffer but still lower than Alice's latest offer.  This shows that you're willing to negotiate while still trying to secure a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, and it's starting to become a better deal to just buy from John. There's a chance Alice might come down to $10,500 or $11,000, but it's not worth the risk. John's price is guaranteed, and the negotiation is becoming increasingly time-consuming. It's time to cut your losses and go with the sure thing."
