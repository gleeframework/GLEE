"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to do business together. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of owning this product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be realistic about my budget.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $650,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me while staying within my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the value you've placed on the product and the fact that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",850000.0,Alice,5,
