Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $650,000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the value you've placed on the product and the fact that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.
