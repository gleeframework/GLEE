"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make a profit on this sale.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Thanks for countering Alice. I appreciate you working with me. Would you consider $7,500 for the product? That's a fair price for both of us, I believe.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about we try $9,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
