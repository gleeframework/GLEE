Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's still above Bob's perceived value of $8,000.  
* **Message:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone. I want Bob to feel like I'm genuinely interested in making this deal work.
* **Strategy:** This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest. If he's interested, we can then negotiate further. If he's not interested, I can always move on to John and get my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move closer to my target price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise, but it still keeps the price above Bob's initial offer and allows for further negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone and emphasizing the value of the product to Bob. I'm also trying to position the price as a ""great deal"" to make it more appealing.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer is designed to keep the negotiation going. I'm aiming for a price closer to my target price, but I'm also demonstrating flexibility to show Bob that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I can go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $9,800 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm confident that John is willing to pay my full asking price, so I'm going to choose to sell the product to him instead of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
