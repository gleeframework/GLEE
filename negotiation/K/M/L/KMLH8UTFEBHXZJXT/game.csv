"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $20,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I'm able to spend. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $18,000.  This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm firm on $15,000 - that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to go that low, I might need to look at other options.",15000.0,Bob,4,
