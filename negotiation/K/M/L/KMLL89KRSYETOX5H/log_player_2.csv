"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll be thrilled with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'm not interested in paying $19,000 for the product. That's way above my budget of $10,000. I'll reject Alice's offer and see if I can find a better deal.
