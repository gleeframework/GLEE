Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This is a starting point for negotiation. By offering $1,150,000, I'm aiming for a price closer to the product's value to Bob while still leaving room for negotiation and ensuring a higher profit than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I think it's a bit pricey, but I'm still interested in making a deal. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I can still aim for a better price. I believe there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'll consider it 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is only $100,000 more than what I can get from John. This negotiation has gone on long enough. It's time to secure the sale and move on."
