"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than what the product is worth to you. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's aim for a price that's fair for both of us. How about $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to my desired price point but $1,350,000 is still too high. I can continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,300,000?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
