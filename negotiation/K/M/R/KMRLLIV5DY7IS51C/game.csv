"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000. Let's see if we can work something out.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's aim for a price that's fair for both of us. How about $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,300,000?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
