{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm starting with an offer of $1,400,000. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than John's offer, I think I can still get closer to my target price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,300,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's aim for a price that's fair for both of us. How about $1,350,000?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,300,000?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering we're already halfway through the negotiations.  It's also a better deal than John's offer and we are getting closer to a deal with Bob.  I'll take the $1,300,000 and move on."
