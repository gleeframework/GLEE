"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is above Bob's valuation, but still leaves some room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a good price.  I'm also leaving myself some room to adjust my offer in the next rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum desired price of $120.  While $95 is closer to his valuation, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is still a bit above Bob's valuation, but it's a significant step down from my initial offer. I hope to meet halfway with Bob and secure a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum desired price of $120, I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target in the next rounds. We are already in the fourth round and I have 6 rounds left before I am forced to sell to John, so I still have some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm going to counter with $100. This is another step down from my previous offer, but it's still a bit above Bob's valuation. I'm hoping this is enough to entice Bob to accept, but still allows me to secure a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is getting closer to Bob's valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $120. I'm not willing to settle for that price yet. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my target in the next rounds. I have 4 rounds left before I am forced to sell to John, so I still have some leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to counter with $95.  This is a significant step down from my previous offer, but it's still a bit above Bob's valuation. We are getting close to the end of our rounds, and I need to secure a deal. I'm hoping this is enough to entice Bob to accept, but still allows me to secure a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum desired price of $120, and we're running out of time.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  While I would have liked to get more, it's better to secure a sale than risk getting nothing at all."
