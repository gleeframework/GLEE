"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $850,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to ensure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm offering the product to you for $812,500. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is clearly sticking to a slow descent and is unwilling to budge much further.  While we could try to push for a slightly better deal, the difference is getting small and we risk her accepting a better offer from someone else.  Taking the $812,500 secures the product at a significant discount."
