Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $100. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **John's Offer:** If Bob declines, you have a guaranteed $80 from John.

By offering the product at $100, you aim for a price that:

* **Is appealing to Bob:**  It's significantly less than his $120 valuation.
* **Earns you a profit:** It's well above your $80 minimum and provides a $20 profit margin. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
