{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset to you.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $10,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's space for you to negotiate and potentially get closer to that amount. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** $10,000 is a good middle ground, and it shows that you're serious about selling the product but are open to negotiation.

Keep in mind, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response. If he rejects your offer, you'll have to consider whether to counteroffer or sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is your minimum,  Bob's offer is at the very bottom of your range. There's still potential for a higher price.  

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  How about $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I still feel it might be a bit high. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle at $8,500? This would allow us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd like to hold out for a bit more, $8,500 is a decent compromise. It's  significantly higher than John's offer, and it's getting closer to my goal. It's a good time to accept and close the deal."
