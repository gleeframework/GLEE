Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  How about $9,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?
