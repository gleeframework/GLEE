Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I need to make a bit more to meet my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.

Round 7
Alice's offer:

This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than John's price of $1,000,000. There's only a limited number of rounds, and further negotiation with Alice may not lead to a better outcome."
