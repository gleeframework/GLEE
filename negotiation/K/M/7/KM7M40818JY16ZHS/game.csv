"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I need to make a bit more to meet my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on. Let's make this deal happen.",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally come to an agreement. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
