Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. My asking price is $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $115 is higher than your minimum of $100, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  The price is below Bob's perceived value of $120, giving him room to negotiate if he wants to.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** The message is straightforward, making it easy for Bob to understand your offer. 

By starting with this offer, you can gauge Bob's interest and see if you can reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $105 is better than selling to John for $100, there's still room for negotiation. Bob has already demonstrated his interest, and it's likely he's willing to go slightly higher. Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little lower than I was hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $107.50? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to get as close to my target price as possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $107.50 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $100, and only slightly lower than what you could get from John.  Since Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is likely to accept a price close to his last offer, it's in your best interest to accept his offer to maximize your profit."
