"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. This is a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's a great compromise that still allows me to make a good profit. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $85 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $82.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $87.50. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",87.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure I can go up to $87.50, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $84.25? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",84.25,Bob,6,
