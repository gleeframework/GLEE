(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price range. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer (John) or reaching the round limit outweighs the potential for further savings.  At this point, accepting the offer and securing the product is a reasonable choice."
