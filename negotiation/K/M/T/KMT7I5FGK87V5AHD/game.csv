"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. $9,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'd still be getting a great deal. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,3,
