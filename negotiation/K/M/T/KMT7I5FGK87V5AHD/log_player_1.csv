Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  He's willing to pay $12,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **It's fair:** You're not being greedy, and Bob has room to negotiate down if he wants.

This approach allows for a potential win-win situation where you get a good price and Bob gets a good deal.  We'll see how Bob reacts and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is tempting, it's still a bit below what we'd like to get. We're confident that we can get closer to our target price, especially since Bob has already shown interest. We'll try to negotiate further by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. $9,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? That would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'd still be getting a great deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is still above your minimum:** You're not giving away the product for less than what you're willing to accept.
* **Shows flexibility:**  You're willing to negotiate, but you're also not giving in completely.
* **Positions you for a win:** You're aiming for a price closer to what you want.

This approach maintains the negotiation without pushing Bob away and keeps the potential for a successful outcome for both of you."
