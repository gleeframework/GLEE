"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $12000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $12000?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13500 to make this deal happen.  This still gives me a good return on my investment, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,
