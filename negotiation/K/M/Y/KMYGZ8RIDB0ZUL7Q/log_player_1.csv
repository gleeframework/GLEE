Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This allows for a back-and-forth exchange and increases the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining a higher threshold:** My minimum acceptable price is $15,000, so I'm comfortable with a lower offer from Bob as long as it's above that threshold. 
* **John as a backup:** The existence of John as a potential buyer at my minimum price gives me the power to walk away from the negotiation if I don't get a satisfactory offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $12000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I appreciate Bob's willingness to negotiate, his offer of $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Since Bob is showing interest and is willing to negotiate, there's still potential to reach a price that works for both of us.  
* **My goal is to maximize profit:**  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees my minimum desired profit, but there's still a chance to earn more with Bob.

I'll counter-offer Bob with a price that's closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $13,500 to make this deal happen.  This still gives me a good return on my investment, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $13,500 represents a significant compromise from my initial offer. 
* **Meeting halfway:** It's also a good starting point for further negotiations, as it's closer to Bob's offer than my initial one.
* **Maintaining value:** It's still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring that I'm not losing too much. 
* **Encouraging agreement:**  By expressing willingness to reach a deal and highlighting the product's value, I'm aiming to encourage Bob to accept my counteroffer."
