{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price.  Therefore, it makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible deal.  By offering $9,000, Bob is testing the waters and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, making it a compelling counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  While it's closer to his target, Bob is still motivated to save as much money as possible.  Therefore, he should reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. His previous offer was rejected, so he's increasing it slightly to show he's willing to compromise.  $9,500 is still a significant savings for Bob, but also a more realistic price for Alice. This is a good compromise offer that could potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to drop below $10,500.  This means that even if Bob makes another counteroffer, Alice might reject it, leading to a stalemate.  Instead of risking further negotiation, Bob should buy the product from John for $10,000. This guarantees him the product at his maximum price and avoids any further potential delays or disagreements."
