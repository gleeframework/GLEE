"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've already invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $1,250,000. This is my final offer for now.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, but I need to make at least $1,200,000 to make it worth my while. Let's try $1,225,000. This is my final offer for now.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,175,000, which is still a bit above our last offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",1175000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,175,000 is close, but I'm aiming for a final price of $1,168,000. I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and respects your need for a reasonable profit.",1168000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,175,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. Let's try to meet in the middle again. I'm willing to go to $1,180,000, but that's as low as I can go.",1180000.0,Alice,9,
