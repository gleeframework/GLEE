Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  We start by aiming high, closer to the upper limit of what Bob might consider. While $1,500,000 is ideal, it's unlikely Bob would agree if the product is only worth $1,000,000 to him.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** The message is crafted to create a sense of urgency and exclusivity, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""initially suggesting"" implies there might be flexibility, allowing Bob to counter-offer if he finds the price too high.
* **Backup Plan:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring Alice doesn't miss out on a guaranteed sale."
