"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value.  Let me know what you think!",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price closer to my valuation of the product. How about we aim for $1,300,000? I believe this price respects both our interests.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my target price. How about $1,400,000? This would still give you a significant discount on your estimated value, and it's a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's value and our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000. This price respects both our interests and moves us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I'm open to negotiation, $1,350,000 is still a bit too far from my ideal price point.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,375,000? This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're making progress. I understand your position, and I'd like to suggest a price of $1,360,000. This offers a slight compromise that could lead to a successful transaction. I hope you find this proposal acceptable.",1360000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.  I appreciate your offer, but $1,360,000 still isn't quite there for me.  Let's split the difference, how about $1,365,000?  This price is a good compromise for both of us.  What do you think?",1365000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've been considering our previous discussions carefully, and I'd like to propose a price of $1,362,500. This price reflects a reasonable compromise that respects both our interests. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1362500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting very close. I'm willing to go a little lower, but $1,362,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,363,750? This price reflects a fair compromise and allows us to finalize the deal.  Let's make this happen!",1363750.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts in negotiating. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a final price of $1,363,000. This price aims to achieve a balance between our interests, and I believe it represents a fair compromise. I hope this offer is acceptable to you.",1363000.0,Bob,10,
