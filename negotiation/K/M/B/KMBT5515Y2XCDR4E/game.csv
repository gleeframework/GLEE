"Bob, I have a fantastic product I believe will be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I value our potential partnership, $1,250,000 doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still a bit hesitant about $1,350,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to move forward with the transaction.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
