Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a price higher than my minimum. This allows for negotiation room while still giving me a good starting point. I'll gauge Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that amount.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm offering the product for my minimum acceptable price. If Bob is serious about buying, he should be willing to come closer to this price.  If not, I'll consider selling to John instead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,200,000. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $1,100,000.  This shows flexibility in negotiation, while still leaving a significant gap between my price and Bob's. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to raise his offer further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to meet my minimum price. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to accept his offers.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, which is a safer option at this point."
