Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high as to be immediately rejected. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for some wiggle room in case Bob counters with a lower offer. 
* **Positive framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and uses a positive tone to encourage acceptance.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to secure a price closer to my minimum value while still leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, I can then assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a counteroffer of my own. If the negotiation stalls, I have the option of selling to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending under $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I believe I can likely secure a higher price through further negotiation, even if it means a few more rounds.
* **John is a safety net:**  Having John as a potential buyer provides a strong safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value but also acknowledging his willingness to pay a bit more than his initial assessment."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is unfortunately still a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to keep my expenses covered. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer strategy:** This counter-offer aims to find a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's offer. It shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better deal.
* **Emphasizing value:** The message highlights the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that $95 is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive tone:** The message uses a positive and conversational tone, keeping the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is designed to test Bob's willingness to compromise. If he accepts, it secures a price closer to my minimum. If he rejects, I'll analyze his next offer and adjust my strategy accordingly, keeping in mind my minimum price and the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to be flexible. While $95 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps agree on $90 for the product? This would allow me to make a purchase without exceeding my spending limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** $90 is still below my desired price of $120, but it's very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Risk of losing deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he'll come back with a higher counteroffer.
* **Opportunity cost:**  By accepting, I can secure a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might result in a lower offer or a stalemate.

**Strategy:**

At this point, I'm willing to take a slightly lower price to ensure a sale.  It's important to consider the potential for losing the deal entirely if I keep rejecting offers.  While $90 isn't ideal, it's a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
