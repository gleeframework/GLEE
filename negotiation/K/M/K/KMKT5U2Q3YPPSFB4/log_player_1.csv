"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $900,000.  This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding the product's value to me. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $750,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $850,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value.  Hopefully, this will be close enough for Bob to accept and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lower. While I want to close a deal, $700,000 is too low.  I will continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $825,000.  This is a more aggressive move to try and entice Bob to accept.  I'm still above my minimum value, but I'm recognizing that I need to be more flexible if I want to secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the negotiation isn't moving forward.  Bob's offers are getting lower and I'm concerned we're too far apart.  To ensure I don't miss out on a guaranteed sale, I'll sell the product to John for $800,000. This guarantees I meet my minimum value and avoids further negotiation."
