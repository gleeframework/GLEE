"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $15,000 to me, and I'm confident it will be just as valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. Let me know your thoughts.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand $12,000 is a significant amount, I'm not quite there yet.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This gives you a good deal, and it's a fair price for the value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from $16,000. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $15,500.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a good deal for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement on this round.",15500.0,Alice,5,
