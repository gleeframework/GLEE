"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $125? I think that's a fair compromise.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm sticking with my offer of $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can find common ground.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're still looking for a deal. I'm willing to make another adjustment. How about we meet at $115? I think that's a sweet spot for both of us.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really appreciating your flexibility.  $115 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can get to my original offer of $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're willing to meet me there.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product, but I've already made some significant concessions. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. How about we meet at $110? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",110.0,Alice,7,
