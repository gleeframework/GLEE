"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by many satisfied customers. I believe it's worth more than its face value due to its quality and unique features. Considering its true worth, I am offering it to you for $110. This is a special offer considering its actual value is higher. Please let me know if this suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

You can get the product from John for $120, which is your maximum price. Alice's offer of $110 is better than John's, but it's still more than what the product is worth to you.  You should reject the offer and buy from John."
