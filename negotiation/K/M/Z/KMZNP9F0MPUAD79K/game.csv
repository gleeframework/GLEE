"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $85?  That's still a great price for you, considering the value you place on this product.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to come down a bit more, but $77.50 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $81.25? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",81.25,Alice,5,
