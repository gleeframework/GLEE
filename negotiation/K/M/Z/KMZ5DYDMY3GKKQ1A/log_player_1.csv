"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm starting with a price of $95. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but leaves some room for negotiation.  Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, there's potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering at $90. This is still a good price for both of us, as it's above my minimum and leaves some room for compromise. Hopefully, Bob will find this offer more appealing than his previous one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can secure a better deal. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $87. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway while still ensuring I get a price I'm comfortable with. With only 5 rounds left, it's important to start closing the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiations, and Bob is not budging from his price. While I'd prefer to get a slightly higher price, I don't want to risk losing out on the deal altogether. It's time to take the guaranteed $80 from John."
