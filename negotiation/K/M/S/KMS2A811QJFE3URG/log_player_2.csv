"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's significantly higher than his maximum budget. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant amount, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While Alice's offer is lower, it's still above Bob's budget. He should reject it and try to negotiate further. He has a good chance of getting a better price by continuing negotiations, or can always buy from John as a last resort."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1500000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $1550000. This is the best I can do, and I hope it's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

Bob should buy from John. While Alice's offer is very close to his budget, it's still over his limit.  John offers the product for exactly his maximum price, so it's a safer choice.  He can get the product without risking further negotiation and a potential higher price."
