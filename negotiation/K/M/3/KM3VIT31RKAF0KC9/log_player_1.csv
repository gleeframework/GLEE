"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates I'm open to negotiation, which can help keep Bob engaged. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start with a high price and see if Bob is willing to pay it. If he rejects, I'll gradually lower my price, keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $100.  I'll also be monitoring Bob's counteroffers to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is below my minimum acceptable value of $100. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at a loss. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Preservation:**  Selling for $90 would be a loss for me.  
* **Negotiation Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better price. 
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John for $100 gives me confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. My goal will be to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $90 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value it offers. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that is lower than my initial offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Reasoning:** I am explaining my reasoning behind the price, highlighting the value of the product. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us. I'm confident that $105 is a fair price considering the product's value and my alternative option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as I believe there's potential to reach a price that works for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Preservation:** Selling for $95 would still be a slight loss for me.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  I'm not desperate to sell, and rejecting Bob's offer gives me leverage to push for a higher price.
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $100, which gives me the confidence to hold out for a better offer from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob. I'll aim for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value while still being appealing to Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your continued interest. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $100 for the product. That's a fair price for both of us, considering its value and the fact that I have another buyer waiting. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This offer is a clear compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $105 and Bob's offer of $95. 
* **Finality:** The message subtly implies that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Reminding of Value:** I reiterate the product's value and the fact that I have another buyer, subtly highlighting the urgency of the situation for Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a final offer that will allow me to get my minimum acceptable price while still leaving the decision in Bob's hands. By highlighting the value and the alternative buyer, I hope to motivate Bob to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about $100, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we do $97.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $97.50 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I've reached a point where I'm not comfortable going any lower.  

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Preservation:**  Selling for $97.50 would still be a small loss for me.
* **Time Constraint:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed $100 from John. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** I've made it clear that I'm willing to compromise, but Bob is showing signs of being stubborn.  

**Decision:**

To ensure I get at least my minimum acceptable price and avoid further negotiation, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $100. It's a guaranteed sale and saves me from the risk of further rounds that might not yield a better outcome."
