"I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to offer $900000 for it. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it could bring to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I recognize the value you see in the product, $900000 is unfortunately too low for me to accept at this time.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1200000. This price still reflects the significant value and potential of the product. I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're willing to come down to $1200000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
