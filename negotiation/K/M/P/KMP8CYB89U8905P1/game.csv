"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $95. This is my final offer, and if you're not able to accept it, I'll have to go with John's offer.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $102?  This is my absolute final offer, and if you can't go that low, I'll have to go with John's offer.",102.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $102. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $108. It's still a good deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,7,
