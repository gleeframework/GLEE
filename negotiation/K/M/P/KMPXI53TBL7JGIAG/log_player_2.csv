{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $1,450,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum budget, he still has some room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows for another round of negotiation. There's a chance Alice will come down further to close the deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget. There is no incentive to continue negotiating with Alice as John is offering the product at the same price.  Bob is better off buying from John to avoid the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer, and potentially ending up with no deal."
