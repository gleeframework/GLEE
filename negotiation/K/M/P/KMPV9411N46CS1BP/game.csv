"Hi Bob, I understand you have a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
