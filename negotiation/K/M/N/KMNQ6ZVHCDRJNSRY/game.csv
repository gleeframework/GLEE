"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,100,000, considering your interest in the product. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This price would allow me to make a profit while also showing that I'm serious about the deal. What are your thoughts on this revised offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
