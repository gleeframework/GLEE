"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, I need to stay closer to $900,000 to make this work. Let's split the difference and go with $875,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $875,000. How about we go with $837,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to make it work.",837500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still looking to get closer to my original price. Let's try $862,500. It's a reasonable compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",862500.0,Alice,5,
