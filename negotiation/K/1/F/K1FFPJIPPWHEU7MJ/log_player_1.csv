Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $149."",
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $150, Alice wants to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's particularly interested, but still ensures Alice gets a great price.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:** While Alice could try a higher price, it risks alienating Bob and making him less likely to negotiate. This approach aims to be attractive while firm."
