Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. I'm also confident that if Bob rejects, I can still sell the product to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not risking too much by starting high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is a good price, I believe I can get more. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a good price for me.  It also signals to Bob that I'm serious about selling the product to him, but I'm not willing to give it away for his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While $950,000 is still a decent amount of money, it's getting closer to John's offer.  To avoid further negotiation and potential risk of a lower price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
