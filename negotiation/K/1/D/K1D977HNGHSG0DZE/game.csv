"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it would bring you a great return. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you think the product has great value, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,500. That's the highest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
