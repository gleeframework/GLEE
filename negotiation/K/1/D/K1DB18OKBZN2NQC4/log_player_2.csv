You can do better than $90.  Let's see if Alice will come down in price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $90 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $87.50. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5

$87.5 is a good price, and it's still within my budget. It's a better deal than buying from John."
