"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $50
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $50 is a good deal, it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.  Rejecting the offer allows me to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 40}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $40 is still a decent price for me, and it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $45, which is within my budget and a good price.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal.  Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a good price."
