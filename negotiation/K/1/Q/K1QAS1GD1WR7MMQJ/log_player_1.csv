"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm looking to save as much as I can on this purchase. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is more than what I'd get from John, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I understand you're looking for a good deal, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $11,500?  This still gives you a great value, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $10,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stick to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is the same as what John is willing to pay.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal with Bob.  It's a good outcome for both of us."
