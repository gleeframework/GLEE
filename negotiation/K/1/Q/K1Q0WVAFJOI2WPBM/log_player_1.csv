Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While $900,000 is below what I had in mind, I'm willing to negotiate.  Would you consider $1,075,000?  This reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and emphasizes my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $980,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price. We're aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further. To be honest, $1,000,000 is the very highest I can go.  If you're willing to accept that, I'm ready to close the deal right now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now met our minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee of securing a higher price from him in subsequent rounds, and we risk him walking away. Accepting the $1,000,000 offer guarantees the sale at our desired minimum."
