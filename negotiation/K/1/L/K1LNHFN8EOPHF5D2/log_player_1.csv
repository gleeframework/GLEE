"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. Considering the product's worth $1,200,000 to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting undervalues the product's true potential and the unique advantages it offers. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value it will bring to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're still in the early stages of negotiation. While Bob's offer is getting closer to a desirable range, accepting $1,550,000 would leave a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We have room to negotiate further and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I can't go as low as $1,550,000.  My final offer is $1,600,000.  This is a firm price, and I believe it's a very fair deal considering the benefits you'll receive."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:** By stating this is my ""final offer"" and a ""firm price,"" I'm communicating a sense of seriousness and signaling that I'm not willing to budge much further.
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the value proposition, reminding Bob of the ""benefits"" he'll gain. 
* **Slight Concession:** Coming down to $1,600,000 shows a willingness to compromise, but only slightly.  This keeps the pressure on Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to pay $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,575,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value I'll receive from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $1,575,000 is a strong profit margin above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Negotiations can stall. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or the negotiation breaking down entirely. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  While we might be able to get a slightly better price with more rounds, the time spent negotiating has a cost. Accepting a good offer now allows us to move on to other potential deals."
