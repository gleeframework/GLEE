"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it will bring you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not willing to pay $1,800,000. Considering the product's worth $1,200,000 to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price you're suggesting undervalues the product's true potential and the unique advantages it offers. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll gain.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not convinced that the product is worth $1,650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,550,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value it will bring to me.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I can't go as low as $1,550,000.  My final offer is $1,600,000.  This is a firm price, and I believe it's a very fair deal considering the benefits you'll receive.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to pay $1,600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,575,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the value I'll receive from the product.",1575000.0,Bob,6,
