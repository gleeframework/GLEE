"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand you see the value, but $600,000 is significantly below its worth. Let's find a middle ground. How about $950,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget. I could go up to $725,000.  That's a significant move on my end. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and is moving closer to our desired price range. We're still significantly above John's offer, so the risk of continuing negotiation is relatively low."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, you're right, that is a significant move.  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we settle at $850,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us closer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $787,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is very slowly approaching our minimum acceptable price, and we're now getting dangerously close to John's offer. At this rate, it's unlikely we can extract a significantly better deal from Bob before we risk going below $800,000.  It's time to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
