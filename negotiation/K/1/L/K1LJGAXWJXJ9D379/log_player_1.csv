"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $11,500. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm still not sure I can justify spending $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,750. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. While $10,750 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with some more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about $10,900?  This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $10,900. I'll try to meet you halfway from that, so I'll counter with $10,450. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,450. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,450
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is attempting to significantly lower the price with each counter. It's clear he's interested, but I need to hold firm to get a price closer to my target. I'll try to steer him back towards a more reasonable increase."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but that price doesn't reflect the true value of this product and what it can do for you.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $10,800, but that's my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 10800
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $10,800 is the best value for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10,225. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,225. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,225
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently aiming for a much lower price point and is not meaningfully approaching my minimum.  He's unlikely to agree to a price that's significantly higher than his current offer. Selling to John for $10,000 is the safest option at this point to guarantee a reasonable profit."
