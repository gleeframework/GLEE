"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its worth to me is much higher."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him more inclined to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $14,000 is a good starting point that allows for multiple rounds of negotiation without immediately reaching my minimum or John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value for the product.
* **Negotiation Room:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer.
* **Time to Counter:** Rejecting the offer allows me to set a new price point and see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a significant discount. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but not going too low, so as not to appear desperate.
* **Maintain Value Focus:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to help justify my price.
* **Encourage Acceptance:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair deal that offers a discount to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $13,000.
* **Potential for Future Deals:** Accepting this offer might build trust with Bob for future potential deals. 
* **Time Constraint:**  I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and selling to John guarantees me a higher price, but I'm not sure if more rounds with Bob will improve the outcome. 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm recognizing the risk of losing a sale entirely."
