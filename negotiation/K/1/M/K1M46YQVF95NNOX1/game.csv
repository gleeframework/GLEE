"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider selling it for $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be willing to accept $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price down, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for a final price of $950,000. This is a strong offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the price as low as possible, but $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this point.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
