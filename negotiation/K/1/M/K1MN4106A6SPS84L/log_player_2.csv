"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers.  It's best to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering! However, $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

While this is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, it's important to start with a counteroffer that leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $155. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but the price is still above your maximum. There's room to negotiate further towards a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down on the price, Alice.  I appreciate the effort.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

This counteroffer makes it clear this is my maximum price and aligns with what John offers. It's a fair proposal given the previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're serious about buying the product, Bob. However, $120 is still a bit too low for me. I can do $142, which is the lowest I can go and still make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has signaled that $142 is her absolute lowest price. Since this is still above your $120 maximum and John offers the product at that price, it's more beneficial to buy from John.  Further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay."
