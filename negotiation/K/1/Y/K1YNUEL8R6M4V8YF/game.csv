"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,120,000? It's a bit closer to your original offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1120000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to reach a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $1,150,000 is my final offer.  It's a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's close to what I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $1,150,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,150,000, which would be $1,075,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
