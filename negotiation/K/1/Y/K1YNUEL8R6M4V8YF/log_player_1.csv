{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A positive and enthusiastic tone encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,250,000 is a good starting point because it's closer to my desired outcome but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** I'm not in a rush and I want to explore the possibility of getting a better price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher value.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:** I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, but John's offer provides me with a fallback option if things don't work out."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm  rejecting Bob's offer but proposing a counter-offer that's closer to my desired price.

* **Fair Deal:** I'm emphasizing the ""fair"" nature of my offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and conversational tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,100,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,120,000? It's a bit closer to your original offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** Bob's offer of $1,120,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I'm not satisfied with this offer and believe I can still get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially reach a more favorable outcome.
* **John's Offer is a Safeguard:** While I'm confident in my negotiating skills, John's offer provides a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to reach a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down a little more, but $1,150,000 is my final offer.  It's a good deal for you, considering the value of the product, and it's close to what I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my final offer, creating pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Reasoning:** I'm  emphasizing the value of the product and the compromise I'm making.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone to avoid escalating the negotiation.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,150,000 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1,150,000 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,150,000, which would be $1,075,000. It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's clear that we are too far apart in our valuations, and further negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome.
* **John's Offer is the Best Option:**  Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,500,000, which is much higher than what Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially losing out on John's offer.

**Conclusion:**

While I would prefer to make a profit from the sale, my priority is to achieve my minimum price target. Selling to John ensures I receive the best possible outcome in this scenario."
