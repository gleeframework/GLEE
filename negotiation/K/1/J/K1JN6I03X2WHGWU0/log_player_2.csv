"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice:**  You'll pay $950,000 and the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, making a profit of $50,000.
* **Buying from John:** You'll pay $1,000,000 and the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, resulting in no profit.

It's always better to accept Alice's offer as it results in a profit, whereas buying from John will only break even."
