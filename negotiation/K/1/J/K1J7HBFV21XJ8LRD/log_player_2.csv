"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal considering what you could gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is under your maximum budget, you know you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,500,000.  There's a chance you can get a better deal by rejecting Alice's initial offer and seeing if she's willing to come down in price."
