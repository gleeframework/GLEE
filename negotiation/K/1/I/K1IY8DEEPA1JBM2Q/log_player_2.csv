"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My starting price is $150.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget. Rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best way to try and get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $120. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$120 is still above your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate, but keep in mind that you only have 7 rounds left.  If you don't get a better offer soon, you might want to consider buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $105.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 105}
