Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,000,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: After further consideration, I'm pleased to offer the product to you at $1,050,000, Bob.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still a $50,000 gap.  Bob can likely push for a slightly lower price, aiming for a final deal closer to $1,000,000.  He has enough rounds left to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'd be willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product.

I believe we're very close to a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After reviewing our costs and considering your offer, I am prepared to offer the product to you at $1,037,500. This price allows us to maintain a healthy profit margin while also being competitive in the market. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,037,500 is only $12,500 higher than Bob's last counteroffer. This is a small enough gap that accepting the offer is the best strategy.  

* **Continuing to negotiate:**  Bob might be able to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars, but the risk is that Alice might get frustrated and pull the offer altogether, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John for a much higher price.
* **Saving time and effort:** Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price without having to expend further negotiation effort.

Given the limited number of rounds remaining, accepting the offer is the most pragmatic choice for Bob to achieve his goal of buying the product at a good price."
