"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above my budget. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000."",
 ""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) than my actual maximum budget ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Leaving Room:** By starting low, I signal to Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal and that she'll need to come down significantly in price if she wants me to buy.
* **Polite but Firm:** My message is polite and expresses interest in the product, but it's also firm about my budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I can meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved down in price, but $9,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm going to try one more time to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to walk away and buy from John if Alice doesn't budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate you moving a bit on the price, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $7,500? That's the highest I can go."",
 ""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving closer to my maximum budget ($8,000) to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going over. 
* **Final Offer:** By saying ""$7,500 is the highest I can go,"" I'm signaling that this is likely my final offer, and she needs to take it seriously.
* **John as Leverage:** I'm prepared to walk away from the deal and buy from John if Alice rejects this offer.  Knowing I have an alternative gives me bargaining power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, Bob. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that I've already moved a bit from my initial offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than this, so this is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000

Alice has met my maximum budget. There's no point in negotiating further or buying from John since they'll both cost me the same amount."
