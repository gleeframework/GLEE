I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not in a hurry to sell, and I think I can get a bit more."

Bob's offer is the same as his last one, and I've already rejected it once.  At this point, I'm willing to accept his offer to avoid risking further negotiation and the possibility of getting a lower price."
