"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $11,500, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Friendly Tone:** I want to start the negotiation with a positive and open tone to build rapport. 
* **Room for Counteroffer:**  This price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling pressured to immediately accept a low offer. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, I can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000 if I feel the negotiation isn't going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the effort. I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Accepting this offer would be a major loss for me.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Bob's offer shows he's willing to negotiate. I can likely get closer to my desired price with further rounds.
* **Time is on my side:**  I have 10 rounds, and there's no pressure to accept a bad offer this early in the game. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $11,000?  That's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $11,500 to $11,000, signaling my willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Price:** I still believe $11,000 is a reasonable price that balances my need to earn at least $12,000 and Bob's perceived value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive to encourage Bob to continue the negotiation."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:**  While Bob's offer is still low, he has increased his offer, indicating that he is willing to negotiate.  This is a positive sign.
* **Room for Improvement:**  I believe I can still get a better price.  We've already had four rounds of negotiation, and I have six more rounds to work with.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer of $11,000, aiming to reach a compromise. I want to show flexibility while still working towards my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $10,500 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping my price slightly from $11,000 to $10,800, hoping to close the gap.
* **Getting Closer:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but it's getting closer to what Bob might be willing to pay.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product by mentioning it again in my message.
* **Encouraging Agreement:** I'm ending the message on a positive note, asking for Bob's thoughts and encouraging a quick resolution."

**Reasoning:**

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,600 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to the value of the product.  How about $10,700? This price would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10700} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer to $10,700. This shows I'm taking his offer seriously, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** I'm highlighting the word ""compromise"" to make it clear that I'm looking for a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Remaining Time:**  We're halfway through the negotiation rounds, and I want to keep the pressure on Bob to reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll continue to evaluate Bob's counteroffers and adjust my own based on his willingness to compromise.  I'm aware that the risk of selling to John increases with each round, but I'm still confident that I can reach a mutually acceptable price with Bob."

* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I've seen Bob increase his offer in previous rounds, and I believe I can still push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's current offer, aiming for a middle ground. I'll reiterate the value of the product to remind Bob why it's worth paying a bit more. I'll also emphasize that time is running out and that this might be our last chance to reach a deal."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,650 is still a little low for me, but to show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,700.  This is our last round before I have to consider my other offer, so let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10700} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  I'm emphasizing the urgency of the situation by reminding Bob that this is our last chance to reach a deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive to encourage Bob to accept my offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John for $12,000, which is a better outcome than accepting a price below my minimum. However, I'm still hoping that we can reach a deal and avoid that scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,675. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,675
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Up:**  This is the final round of negotiation. I have to make a decision now.
* **Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $10,675 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Secure Deal:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $12,000, which is more than I would get by accepting Bob's offer.

**Conclusion:**

While I would have preferred a higher price, the risk of getting nothing if I reject Bob's final offer is too high.  Selling to John at $12,000 is the most secure and profitable option at this point."
