Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Giving Bob some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum:**  You are still leaving yourself some profit margin.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  Making it easy for Bob to understand the offer.

Remember, this is just the first step in the negotiation. You'll need to be flexible and adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1,050,000. This reflects the product's value to me, and it's a fair price considering your desired profit margin. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  You're in a good position because you have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay your minimum.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Maintain your leverage:**  Show Bob that you're not desperate for a quick sale.
* **Explore higher offers:** See if you can push Bob closer to your desired price point. 

This is a strategic move to maximize your profits."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's fair considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still remaining above your minimum.
* **Fairness:** The offer emphasizes the value Bob will get, making it more appealing.
* **Meeting in the middle:** This strategy often leads to quicker agreement and avoids lengthy negotiations.

By proposing $1,125,000, you're showing flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position. This counteroffer puts the ball back in Bob's court and allows him to either accept or make a new counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and my budget.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  You have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay your minimum, so it's best to take the sure thing.

By selling to John, you:

* **Guarantee your minimum profit:** You secure the highest possible price for your product.
* **Avoid further negotiation:** You avoid potentially exhausting negotiations that may not lead to a satisfactory outcome.
* **Minimize risk:**  You eliminate the risk of Bob continuing to haggle or rejecting future offers.

This decision is a smart move to ensure the best possible outcome for your financial interests."
