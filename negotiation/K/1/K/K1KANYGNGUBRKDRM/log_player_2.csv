**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a decent price, Bob can still save money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  This price still gives you a great deal, and it's fair considering the value of the product.

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's maximum willingness to pay.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should try to push for a lower price."
