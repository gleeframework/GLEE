# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. This product is a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,220,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.

Alice is unlikely to go any lower and is holding firm at $1,220,000.  It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed deal from John at $1,200,000."
