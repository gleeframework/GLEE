Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, above my minimum value, but allows room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more if I continue negotiating with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm offering $175. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but still gives me a profit margin above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $160 is a good deal and above my minimum.  It's also a good compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
