Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and creates a perception of high value. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Urgency:**  Creating a sense of urgency (limited-time offer, other interested parties) can encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, your goal is to maximize profit, but getting a deal done is better than no deal at all (since you have John as a backup)."
