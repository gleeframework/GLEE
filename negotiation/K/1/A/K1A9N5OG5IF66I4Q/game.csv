"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $750,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $700,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little ways off.  Could you do $675,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",675000.0,Bob,4,
