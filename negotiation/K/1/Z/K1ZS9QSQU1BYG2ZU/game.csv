,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $125 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $170? That would make it worth my while.",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $170 is still a bit steep. Let's split the difference and meet in the middle at $140.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
