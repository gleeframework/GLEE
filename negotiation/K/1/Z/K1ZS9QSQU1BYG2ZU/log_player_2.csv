Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  How about $125?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $125 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $170? That would make it worth my while.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $170 is still a bit steep. Let's split the difference and meet in the middle at $140.  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
