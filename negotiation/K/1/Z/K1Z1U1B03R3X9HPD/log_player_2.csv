"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly rated by many satisfied customers. Considering its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than what others are paying, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's aim for something around $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is slightly better than John's price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering.  There's no need to rush into an agreement at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $140 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a mutually beneficial solution. I am willing to consider your offer of $125, but I need to ensure I receive a fair return for my product. Would it be possible for us to meet somewhere in the middle? How about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, he can likely still get a better deal by continuing to counter-offer. There's room for further negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $135 is still a bit outside my price range. Let's try $130.  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows me to purchase the product without going over my budget."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your effort to reach an agreement, Bob. After considering your proposal, I am willing to accept $130 for the product. This price not only meets your budget but also ensures a reasonable profit for me. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is the best deal Bob has gotten so far. While it's a little higher than John's price, there's no guarantee that Bob can get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  There's also a risk that if Bob rejects this offer, Alice might not be willing to negotiate further, and Bob might end up paying more in the long run."
