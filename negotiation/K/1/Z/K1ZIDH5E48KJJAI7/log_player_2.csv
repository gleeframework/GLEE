Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  This is a good starting point for a counteroffer, as it shows I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm not willing to pay her asking price."

Alice's offer is still too high, but it's getting closer. I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.  It's worth trying to get an even lower price."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing that I'm serious about buying.  $700,000 is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will be acceptable to her.  It's a good middle ground between my initial offer and her last offer."
