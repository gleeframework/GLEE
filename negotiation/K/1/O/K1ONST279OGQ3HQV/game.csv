"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's unique features. However, $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering the value I'm placing on this product, I'm willing to go up to $11000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $11000, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12500 and $11000, which is $11750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
