"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can we meet in the middle at $1600000?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm afraid $1600000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1700000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1700000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1600000 and $1700000, which is $1650000. Can we consider that price?",1650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to consider your revised offer. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $1650000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can sell it to you for $1725000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",1725000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're getting close to the sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1650000 and $1725000, just like you suggested, but I'd like to propose a slightly higher number. I can offer it to you for $1695000. It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise considering the product's value and our negotiations so far.",1695000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit below $1695000. I'm willing to go up to $1680000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we consider that price?",1680000.0,Bob,8,
