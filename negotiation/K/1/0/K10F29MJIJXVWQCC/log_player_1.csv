Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $95. I believe it's worth much more, but I want to give you a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to feel like he got a slight discount.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** It's crucial that the offer to Bob is significantly higher than John's $80 offer, ensuring Alice doesn't undervalue the product if Bob declines. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
