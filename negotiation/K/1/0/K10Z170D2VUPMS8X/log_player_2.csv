"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $925,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it's still more than the product is worth to Bob. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can negotiate with Alice further or simply buy from John.  He has the leverage knowing he can purchase it for $1,000,000 from John."
