"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. It's a rare opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll appreciate. I'm open to negotiations, but I have to start with a price that reflects its true value. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1800000. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1800000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only willing to go up to $1200000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but $1200000 is a bit below my target. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1500000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1350000.  This is a significant offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $1350000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time, I'll compromise at $1400000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope you'll consider it a fair offer.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still hesitant at $1400000.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $1375000. This is a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close this deal.",1375000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1375000. I'll make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1400000, but I need you to meet me halfway on the next concession. Let's aim for $1380000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can seal the deal.",1380000.0,Alice,7,
