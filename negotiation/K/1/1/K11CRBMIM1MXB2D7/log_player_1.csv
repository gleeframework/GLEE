Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, there's no risk in starting with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""incredible value"" to create a perception that the product might be worth even more than $2,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  This high starting price allows room for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can gradually lower the price, still aiming to stay well above your minimum.

By starting high, you maximize your potential profit while still leaving the door open for Bob to accept a price that's beneficial for both of you."
