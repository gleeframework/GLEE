Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a fair price for me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than nothing, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum of $10,000. I have 8 rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob is getting closer to my target, $8,750 is still below my minimum. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired outcome. With 6 rounds left, I still have time to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but $8,750 is still too far from what I need to accept.  I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $9,250. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to compromise further, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm getting close to my limit, so I hope you can meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $9,000, which is just $1,000 below my minimum.  I'm going to accept his offer, as I have only 4 rounds remaining and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. While I would prefer $10,000, $9,000 is still a good profit and a solid outcome for this negotiation."
