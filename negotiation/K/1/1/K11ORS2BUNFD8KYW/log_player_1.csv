Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic deal on this product. I know you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming higher with Bob first allows us to potentially maximize our profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a significant discount from our asking price but still a substantial profit above Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This makes the offer appealing while leaving room for negotiation if needed.
* **Time Value:** A quicker sale to Bob, even at a slightly lower price, might be preferable to waiting for John. 

**Important Note:** This assumes we don't know how much Bob is willing to pay. If we had that information, we could tailor our offer even more effectively."
