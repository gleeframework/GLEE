This offer is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum of $8,000, which means you make a decent profit. It's also lower than Bob's maximum of $15,000, which means he's still getting a good deal. 

This strategy is based on the principle of maximizing your gains while also minimizing the risk of rejection."
