"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for starting the conversation, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your interest in the product, and I appreciate your offer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this incredible product. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget. How about we split the difference again and settle on $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
