Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down in price, she's unlikely to reach a number that beats John's offer of $1,000,000. There's no point in continuing the negotiation and risking ending up with a worse deal.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
