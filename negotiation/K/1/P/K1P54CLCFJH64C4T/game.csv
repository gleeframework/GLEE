"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too steep for me.  Considering its value to me, I'd be willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value to both of us,  I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
