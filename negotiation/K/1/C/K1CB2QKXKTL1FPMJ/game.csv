"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1800000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $800000 for this product. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1800000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this incredible product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down a bit.  However, $1200000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $900000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering my budget constraints and the value I place on the product.  I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, which is the lowest I can go. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
