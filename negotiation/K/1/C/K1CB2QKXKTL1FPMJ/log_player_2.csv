Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1800000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1200000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this incredible product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

Alice is still unwilling to come down to a price you're comfortable with. It's better to buy from John and save $300,000."
