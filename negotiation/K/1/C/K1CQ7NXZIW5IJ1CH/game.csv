"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still think the product is worth more than $7,500. How about we try $8,500? It's a compromise, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,5,
