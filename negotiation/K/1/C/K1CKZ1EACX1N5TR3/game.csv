"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be honest with you, $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my finances. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. Can we meet at this price?",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be mindful of your finances, but I'm not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, I can offer you a price of $11000. This is the closest I can get to meeting you halfway without compromising my minimum price. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm afraid $11000 is still out of my budget. I've already told you that I'm willing to pay up to $8000 for the product. I'm not willing to go any higher. Can we meet at this price?",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $12000, and you've made it clear that $8000 is your maximum budget. I'm not willing to compromise further on the price. I'm going to have to sell the product to someone else if we can't come to an agreement. I'm going to give you one final chance to meet my minimum price. If not, I'll be selling the product to someone else today.",12000.0,Alice,7,
