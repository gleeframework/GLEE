"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with a price of $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves a decent profit margin for me. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I've already reached round 4.  I'm concerned that we're not making good progress and I might not be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds. It's better to sell to John now and secure a guaranteed $10,000 than to risk getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement with Bob."
