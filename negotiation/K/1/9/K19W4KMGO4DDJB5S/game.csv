"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1,100,000 is unfortunately not a price I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and I'd be happy to finalize the sale.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,212,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1212500.0,Alice,5,
