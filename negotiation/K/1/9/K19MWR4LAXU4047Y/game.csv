"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $900,000? That feels like a fairer price point.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900,000 is tempting, it's a bit too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still leaves plenty of room for you to profit, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly.  Would you consider $950,000? It's a strong offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable.",950000.0,Bob,4,
