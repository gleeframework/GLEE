Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm not willing to go all the way to $115, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $125? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to a price I find acceptable, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $125. At this point, I'd rather take the guaranteed savings and buy from John for $120."
