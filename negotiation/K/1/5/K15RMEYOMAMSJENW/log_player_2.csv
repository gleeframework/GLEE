You're willing to pay up to $10,000, but Alice is asking for $9,500.  You can likely do better.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $9,000 yet.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a good deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!

Alice has come down to $9,250, which is within your budget and a good deal compared to John's $10,000 price. It's worth accepting the offer and finalizing the deal."
