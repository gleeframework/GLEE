Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob is offering the maximum he's willing to pay, which is still below my minimum. I've already given him a few concessions, and I don't want to risk going lower. It's time to move on and accept the sure deal with John."
