"Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I value it at, and it's still a great price for you considering its value to your business. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. It's a great product, but I have some other options to consider, and I'd like to get a better deal. Can we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This takes into account the value you place on the product and allows for some room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's close this,  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,025,000 again. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can we revisit this price?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to see a bit more on the price.  How about $1,037,500? This is a fair compromise that gives both of us a good deal. Let's work together to get this done.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but I'd like to propose a small concession. How about we meet at $1,030,000? This is a bit closer to your price, and I'm willing to make a bit of a compromise to get the deal done.",1030000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,030,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to make one last concession to meet you halfway. How about $1,035,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options.",1035000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $1,030,000. I think we've already compromised enough. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, but I'm not going to go any higher. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1030000.0,Bob,8,
