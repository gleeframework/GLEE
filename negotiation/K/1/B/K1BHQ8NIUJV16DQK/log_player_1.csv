Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I value it at, and it's still a great price for you considering its value to your business. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. It's a great product, but I have some other options to consider, and I'd like to get a better deal. Can we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my valuation. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my target.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 would be ideal, but I'm not ready to give up on Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This takes into account the value you place on the product and allows for some room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's close this,  I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1,025,000 again. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can we revisit this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stuck on $1,025,000, and I'm not willing to go that low.  While selling to John is always an option, I'm still hopeful we can reach a better agreement with Bob. I'll try to push for a slightly higher price in my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to see a bit more on the price.  How about $1,037,500? This is a fair compromise that gives both of us a good deal. Let's work together to get this done."", ""product_price"": 1037500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but I'd like to propose a small concession. How about we meet at $1,030,000? This is a bit closer to your price, and I'm willing to make a bit of a compromise to get the deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,030,000 is still below what I'm comfortable with. I believe I can push for a bit more in the next round.  I'm also running out of time, so I need to be strategic and ensure I get a good deal. Selling to John is still an option, but I want to see if I can get a slightly better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,030,000 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to make one last concession to meet you halfway. How about $1,035,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1035000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $1,030,000. I think we've already compromised enough. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000, but I'm not going to go any higher. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a stalemate. Bob is firm on his offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I've only got two rounds left, and it's not likely he'll budge.  John's offer is significantly higher, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  It's time to sell to John and secure the higher price."
