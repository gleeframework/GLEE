"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable for the right person. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. This price reflects the value I see in it, but I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum price of $1,200,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the potential value you see in this product. While I'm interested,  $1,500,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This price is a significant amount for me, and I believe it reflects the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start Low:**  We're aiming to save as much as possible, so we start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. 
* **Be Realistic:**  $1,100,000 is still a considerable amount, demonstrating our interest without going over our budget. 
* **Justify:**  We provide a brief reason for our counteroffer (budget limitations) to make it seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While $1100000 is below my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This price still reflects the significant value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering your offer.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $1,250,000 is still above your budget. While it's closer to your maximum, you can try to push for a lower price. You're only $50,000 away from your maximum, and further negotiation could potentially save you that amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $1,250,000 is still slightly higher than I'm comfortable with, given my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer is at your absolute maximum, signaling that you're serious about making a deal.
* **Justification:** We highlight the ""value we both see in the product"" to make it sound like a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **Clear Terms:**  We explicitly state this is your maximum price, leaving no room for further negotiation.

**Outcome:**

If Alice rejects this offer, you can move on to buying from John, as you've reached your maximum price."
