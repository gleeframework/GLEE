"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000.  This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested in discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is better than buying from John, but it's still above your maximum budget. Since you're aiming to save as much money as possible, you should reject the offer and try to negotiate further with Alice, or consider other options."
