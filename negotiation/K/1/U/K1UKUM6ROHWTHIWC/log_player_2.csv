"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $9000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is a good deal, you can potentially do better. There are 9 rounds left to negotiate, and Alice's opening offer suggests she might be willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's certainly tempting, but I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000.  Are you open to negotiating further?"", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend closer to $7000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8200. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  You've only had 2 rounds and still have 8 remaining to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $8,200 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get a bit lower. Would you consider $7,500? "", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $8100. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:**  Alice has stated this is her lowest price, suggesting further negotiation might be unproductive.
* **Good price:**  $8,100 is a good price, considering you're aiming for under $15,000.
* **Time pressure:** We're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation.  If you reject, there's a risk Alice will become less flexible or the negotiation could drag on, making you more likely to buy from John.

It's a gamble, but accepting the offer is the most likely way to secure a good deal within the remaining rounds."
