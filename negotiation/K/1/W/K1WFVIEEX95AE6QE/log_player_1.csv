"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to potentially earn more than the minimum I need while also keeping the deal open for discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $90 is still below my minimum desired price of $120.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $90 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $92.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $92.5 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my goal of earning as much as possible. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $94? It's a good compromise and a fair price for the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 94} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you at $93, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. I'm trying to stay within my budget and I think this price is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $93 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not happy with the deal. There are a few more rounds, so I'll try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $93 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to come down a little further to $93.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the last offer I can make. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 93.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your last offer, but I'm afraid $93.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum acceptable price, and the remaining rounds are too few to get a significant price increase. Therefore, selling to John at $120 is the best option to maximize my earnings."
