"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $90 just doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $92.50. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $94? It's a good compromise and a fair price for the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $93, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. I'm trying to stay within my budget and I think this price is a fair compromise.",93.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $93 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to come down a little further to $93.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's the last offer I can make. Let's finalize this deal.",93.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your last offer, but I'm afraid $93.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",92.0,Bob,8,
