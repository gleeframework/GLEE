Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product.  Given its value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique item, and I believe this price reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both you (the minimum you'd sell for) and Bob, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and uniqueness helps justify the high asking price.
* **Backup Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,000,000 provides a safety net. This means you can afford to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While the product is valuable to him, he might not be willing to pay significantly more than his perceived value. 
* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in mind will be crucial."
