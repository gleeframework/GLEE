Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm framing the price as ""fair"" based on Bob's perceived value, which could make him more willing to negotiate.
* **Open to Counteroffers:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to counteroffers, keeping the negotiation going.

This approach aims to maximize my potential profit while still leaving space for negotiation to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my ideal price point.  There's potential to push for a higher price.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to my initial offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate and maintain leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Step:**  I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his, aiming for a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $1,375,000?  This would ensure we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1375000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is exactly halfway between my last offer and Bob's, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:** The message reminds Bob of the value he places on the product, further justifying the price.
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a positive and respectful tone, making the negotiation less adversarial.

By offering a middle ground price and framing it as a ""fair deal"", I aim to reach an agreement quickly without giving up too much of my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,300,000. How about we try to find a compromise at $1,325,000? I'm willing to stretch a bit, but I need to make sure it's still a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,350,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and demonstrates that I am not desperate to sell.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe there's still a chance to reach a price that's more favorable to me.

**Next Step:**  I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his, but lower than my last offer.  This will show a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,325,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a compromise that's a bit higher.  How about we meet at $1,350,000?  This is a good balance for both of us, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm only increasing the price by $25,000, showing a genuine desire to reach a compromise.
* **Focusing on Value:** The message again highlights the value the product holds for Bob, reinforcing the justification for the price.
* **Finality Implication:** While not explicit, the wording subtly suggests this could be my final offer, adding some pressure to reach an agreement.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our positions while still staying within my target range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,325,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to know that I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $1,325,000, and you throw in some extras or services to sweeten the deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob's offer is essentially a final stand at $1,325,000, and he's now shifting the negotiation towards non-monetary concessions. 
* **No Room for Improvement:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price closer to my target. 
* **Minimizing Loss:**  While selling to John for $1,200,000 is less than ideal, it's still a significant amount and minimizes the potential loss from a protracted negotiation.

**Conclusion:** Given the stalemate and the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or non-monetary concessions, it's more prudent to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed sale for a substantial amount."
