"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I'm still aiming for a higher price closer to my minimum of $12,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you as well."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $11,000 is still below my minimum of $12,000. I'll try to push for a higher price in the next round, but if I don't get close to my minimum, I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500, which is my final offer. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John for $12,000.  Bob's offer of $11,500 is still below my minimum, and I'm worried we're getting too close to the end of the negotiation. While I would prefer to get closer to my asking price, John is offering me a guaranteed deal at my minimum, which is a good outcome."
