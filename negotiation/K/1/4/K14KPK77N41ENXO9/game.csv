"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $13,000? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for you as well.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000, which is the highest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum while still giving you a good deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500, which is my final offer. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",11500.0,Bob,6,
