"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. I'm getting close to my maximum, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $9,800 is a good offer, it's still a little lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and agree on $10,200? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with your purchase. ",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,900? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget.",9900.0,Bob,6,
