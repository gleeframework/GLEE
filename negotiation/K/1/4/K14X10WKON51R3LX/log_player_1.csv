"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal for you, and I'm confident it'll be worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I believe I can get closer to my desired amount by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. I'm getting close to my maximum, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to settle for less than $10,000. I believe I can get a better price with a counteroffer in the next round, or potentially even sell to John for $10,000 if negotiations with Bob continue to stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $9,800 is a good offer, it's still a little lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we split the difference and agree on $10,200? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with your purchase. "", ""product_price"": 10200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,900? I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but we're still $100 apart. I've already made several concessions, and it's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob. While I could potentially get a slightly higher price with more rounds, I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed $10,000 from John.  The potential gains from further negotiations are not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely."
