"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a strong starting point, giving me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It also gives me the opportunity to see if Bob is seriously interested in the product and what his potential price range might be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to see if he's willing to come up in price.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, as this is the price I could get from John. I'm hoping Bob sees the value in my product and is willing to meet me at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still offering significantly below what I consider fair. I'm not willing to accept his offer, but I also don't want to lose out on the deal completely. I'll counteroffer again in the next round and try to inch closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,100,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeps the price above my minimum.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable price and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but still below my minimum.  I'm not willing to accept it yet. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can finally reach an agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise, and I hope Bob will see it as a sign of my willingness to reach a deal.  We're getting closer to a middle ground, and I'm hoping we can agree in the next couple of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to accept it. I'm going to counteroffer one last time to see if we can finally reach a deal.  If he rejects again, I'm going to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but I won't go any lower. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell the product to John."

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's clear Bob is not willing to meet me at a price I'm comfortable with.  I've already compromised as much as I'm willing to, and I'm running out of time.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to guarantee I receive a price that is worth it to me."
