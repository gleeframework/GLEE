"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a high price, knowing that I can always go lower. This sets the negotiation in my favor.
* **Show enthusiasm:**  The message is positive and emphasizes the potential value of the product to Bob. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  $10,000 is above my minimum, giving me space to negotiate if Bob counters.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and how the negotiation progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to find the product for a bit less. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counter is close:**  While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet. There's still room for negotiation.
* **Building leverage:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to maintain control and potentially get a higher price. 
* **Not desperate:**  Selling to John for $8,000 is always an option, but I'm not desperate to close the deal immediately.

**Next Step:**  I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my desired price while staying within a range that's likely to be acceptable to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? It's a fair price that gives us both a good outcome.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" that benefits both of us, making it more appealing.
* **Open to further discussion:**  The message ends with a question, inviting Bob to continue the dialogue and potentially agree.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming to find a compromise that's closer to my preferred price while still being reasonable for Bob. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always fall back to selling to John for $8,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I think we can find a price that works for both of us. Would it be possible to lower the price to $9600? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room to negotiate:** While Bob's offer is closer to my preferred price, I'm still not ready to accept it.  A few hundred dollars can make a significant difference.
* **Maintaining control:** By rejecting the offer, I keep the negotiation moving and have the opportunity to potentially get a higher price. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Selling to John for $8,000 is still a secure option, but I'm not desperate.

**Next Step:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price that is more favorable to me while remaining within a reasonable range for him.  I'll need to be strategic, considering the number of rounds remaining and the potential for reaching a deadlock."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  How about we split the difference this time and settle on $9,650?  That's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9650}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Focusing on a compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that's right in the middle of our last two offers. This emphasizes my willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Adding urgency:**  ""Let's close this deal!"" adds a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Keeping the door open:**  The message still leaves room for further negotiation, but I'm positioning this as a final offer. 

**Strategy:**  With only five rounds remaining, I'm pushing to get close to my desired price.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to weigh the risk of accepting his next counteroffer versus the potential for reaching a stalemate.  I'll also keep selling to John as a fallback option."
