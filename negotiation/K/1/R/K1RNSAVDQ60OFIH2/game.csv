"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to move from my initial offer. How about we consider $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $775,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't quite agree to that figure.  Would you consider $875,000?  I believe that price reflects the true value of this product.",875000.0,Alice,5,
