# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations. Given its high value and potential impact on your endeavors, I am extending an exclusive offer to acquire it at a special price of $10,000. This offer is tailored to ensure that both parties benefit from this transaction. I look forward to your positive response and the opportunity to collaborate with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely negotiate a better price. John's offer of $12,000 serves as a fallback option, so you have some leverage with Alice."
