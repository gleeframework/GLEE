"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,500,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price represents a fair compromise. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 is still above my target price. I'm prepared to offer $1,050,000. This is a significant step closer to my budget, and I believe it reflects the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
