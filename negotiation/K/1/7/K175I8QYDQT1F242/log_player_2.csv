"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $12,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond your initial assessment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is way more than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer makes sense here. This accomplishes a few things:

* **Gauges Alice's flexibility:**  A significant counter-offer will tell us how willing Alice is to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, we're still well below our $8,000 maximum and can increase our offer in future rounds.
* **Anchoring:**  By throwing out the $6,000 figure first, we're attempting to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price range. 

This strategy aims to get us the best possible deal, while acknowledging that Alice ultimately wants to sell the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved towards our price, $9,000 is still higher than our alternative option with John ($8,000). We have room to negotiate further downwards and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  Could you do $7,500? That would make it much easier for me to say yes."", 
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer but staying below:** This counteroffer acknowledges Alice's compromise while moving us closer to a potential deal. Importantly, it keeps us below our $8,000 limit.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason (budget constraints) can make the offer feel more genuine and increase the chances of Alice accepting.
* **Leaving room:**  We're still leaving some negotiating space ($500) in case Alice is unwilling to go this low."
