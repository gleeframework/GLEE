Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept anything below my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to be fair.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, which is a significant investment for me and a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum. It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by being too stubborn."
