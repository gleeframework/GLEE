"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 to be fair.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,600,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,550,000, which is a significant investment for me and a fair compromise.  Let's work towards a deal at this price.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
