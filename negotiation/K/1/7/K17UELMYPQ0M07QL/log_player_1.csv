Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer:

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** This price still nets a $125,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Dragging out negotiations can be risky. Bob might lose interest or I might miss out on other opportunities. 
* **Bird in the Hand:** It's better to secure a good deal now than gamble on a potentially higher, but uncertain, offer later."
