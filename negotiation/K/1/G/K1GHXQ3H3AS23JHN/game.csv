"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 just doesn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference at $110?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not comfortable with $110 either. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,
