"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Highlight Value to Bob:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to make my offer more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message suggests I'm open to negotiation, but I want to make it clear that I'm not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is high, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price and still above his perceived value. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I want to continue negotiating and see if I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Opportunity to Improve:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I have the opportunity to send a counteroffer that might be more appealing to him. 
* **Selling to John:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a good option, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000 by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our ongoing negotiation, $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000? This would allow both of us to achieve a satisfactory outcome."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm proposing a price that is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing how this compromise would be beneficial for both of us, increasing the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:**  My counteroffer is still higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's closer to my desired price. 
* **Continued Negotiation:** By continuing to negotiate, I'm hoping to reach a mutually agreeable price before needing to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. However, given my financial constraints, I am unable to meet $1,075,000. I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $1,025,000. I hope this might be more in line with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is only $25,000 below my desired price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $1,200,000, there is a risk that further negotiation might lead to a lower offer or a breakdown in talks. 
* **Time Factor:** We are already in round 4, and selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed option.  
* **Strategic Choice:** It's a strategic decision to accept this offer as it is relatively close to my goal, and continuing negotiations might not be worth the risk or time."
