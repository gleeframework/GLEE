"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a fair price given its potential.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must admit, $1,050,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product's true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its inherent value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers and propose a price of $1,075,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in this product.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
