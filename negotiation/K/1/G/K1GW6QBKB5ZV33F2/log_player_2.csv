"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value is undeniable, and I believe it can significantly benefit your endeavors. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a fair price given its potential.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I must admit, $1,050,000 is a significant undervaluation of this product's true potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its inherent value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his target.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and try to get closer to his ideal price.  Buying from John is still a worse option, so rejection is the best course of action at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our previous offers and propose a price of $1,075,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
