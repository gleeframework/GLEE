"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is quite high.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is within Bob's budget and a significant saving compared to John's price of $12,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or him having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
