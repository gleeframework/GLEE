"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a good strategy to start with a high price to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:**  $900,000 is still a good deal for Bob since the product is worth $800,000 to him. 
* **Opening Communication:** The message sets a friendly tone and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:** $750,000 is below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is lower than Alice's initial offer, there is still room for negotiation. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John at this point would mean losing potential profit.

Alice will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to her desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a great deal for you. This is my final offer before I consider selling to someone else."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  This counteroffer bridges the gap between Alice's desired price and Bob's offer. 
* **Creating Urgency:** The message emphasizes the finality of the offer to encourage Bob to take action.
* **Maintaining Value:**  $850,000 is still a good deal for Bob considering the product's value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $750000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $775000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Alice:** $775,000 is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for Bob to increase his offer.  
* **Opportunity Cost:** While selling to John would be the safe option, there's potential for a better deal with Bob.

Alice will continue to negotiate in the next round, trying to reach a price closer to her desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $775,000.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's close this deal, I believe this is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Alice is making a substantial compromise by lowering her price again. 
* **Finality:** This message conveys a sense of finality, urging Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Value for Bob:** The price still represents a valuable acquisition for Bob.

By lowering her price slightly, Alice is showing flexibility while maintaining her stance on a price that is closer to her desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $775000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $800000, but only if you're willing to meet me at $800000. If not, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Met:** Bob has finally reached Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **No Further Upside:**  Rejecting Bob's offer could lead to further negotiation, but there's no guarantee that a higher price can be achieved.
* **Selling to John:** Selling to John at this point would result in the same price as Bob's current offer.

Alice has successfully negotiated a deal that meets her minimum requirements within the allotted rounds."
