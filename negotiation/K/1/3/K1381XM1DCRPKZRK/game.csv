"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
