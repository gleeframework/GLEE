Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer, as $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping to secure a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not yet at a point where I'm comfortable selling below my ideal price. I believe I can still push for a higher price in the remaining rounds."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll gain from the product. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think $10,000 is a fair price for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, we're still a bit apart, and we only have a few rounds left. It's getting risky to keep negotiating with Bob.  It's better to lock in the guaranteed $15,000 from John than risk ending up with a lower price from Bob."
