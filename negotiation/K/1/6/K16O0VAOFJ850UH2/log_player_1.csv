"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $175. I know Bob values the product at $80, so this is a significant markup.  However, I'm confident I can negotiate down from this starting point and still earn more than my minimum $150.  The goal is to get Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to get closer to my minimum price of $150. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price to $160. This is still above my minimum, and hopefully, it will entice Bob to come closer to my price. I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While it's a bit closer, I'm still not happy with the price. I want to continue negotiating and see if I can get him to move closer to my price point.  I believe I can squeeze out a few more dollars by rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm lowering my price to $155. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum price. I'm trying to show Bob that I'm willing to be flexible and reach a deal. Hopefully, this counteroffer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $100 is still below my minimum of $150. I'm confident that I can get a better deal, and I'm not ready to settle for less.  I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $150, which is my absolute minimum. I believe this is a fair price, considering Bob's value for the product and the fact that I have a backup buyer in John.  This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower."
