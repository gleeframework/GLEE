"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm!  While I see the value in the product, $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it, considering its value to me. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value it holds for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This feels like a fair price considering our respective values and allows us to both walk away happy.  What do you say?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet me halfway, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value I've attached to the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $9,200. This is my final offer.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but it's still a bit too high for me.  I understand we're getting closer to a deal.  I'm willing to pay $8,900.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with another option, as $9,200 is my upper limit.",8900.0,Bob,6,
