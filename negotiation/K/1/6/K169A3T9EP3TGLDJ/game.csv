"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle at $900,000? That's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
