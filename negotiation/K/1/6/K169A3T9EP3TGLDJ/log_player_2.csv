It's time to cut bait and go with John.  

Alice has made it clear she's very unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  She's using classic negotiation tactics: 

* **""Final offer"" claims:** These are rarely truly final, but designed to put pressure on you.
* **Small concessions:** Her price drops have been to make you think a deal is close.

You're risking wasting more time and potentially missing out on the guaranteed $1,000,000 deal with John."
