"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to buy this product from you, but I can only offer $13000. I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you, and I think it's a good middle ground. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $16000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm confident this product is worth it, but I can only offer $14500. Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14500 is still a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $15500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15500.0,Alice,5,
