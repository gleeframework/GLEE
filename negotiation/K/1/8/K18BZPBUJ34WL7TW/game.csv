"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $18000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $12000? I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",16000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $16000, so I'll offer $14000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and rarity.",14000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'll meet you halfway from $16000, so I'll offer it to you for $15500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.",15500.0,Alice,7,
