"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth more to you than the $12000 you're willing to pay. If you decide to pass, I'll be selling it to John for $15000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $12,000 for the product. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than what John is charging, it's still above your budget.  Therefore, it's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
