Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting close to your minimum ($1,000,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""potential worth,"" you aim to justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Strategic positioning:** Offering it for $950,000 makes John's $1,000,000 offer seem even more appealing if Bob rejects, potentially leading to a quicker deal with John.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a price that's potentially attractive compared to its worth to him."
