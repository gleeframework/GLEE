"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. I understand it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's significantly below that. I'm confident this is a deal you won't want to miss.  Let's talk about a price of $1,200,000.  This gives you a substantial profit while allowing me a strong return on my investment.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
