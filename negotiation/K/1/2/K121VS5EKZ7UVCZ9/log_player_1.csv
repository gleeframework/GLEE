Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit to $150, which is still a fair price for this product."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied with his offer. I'll try to push for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still not comfortable with $135. Let's split the difference and go with $142.50. It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 142.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $142.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $137.50, but no more. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. With only four rounds left, the risk of not finding a better price with Bob is too high. I'm better off selling to John and guaranteeing myself a profit."
