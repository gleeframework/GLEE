"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $9500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $7000?  I'm serious about buying it, but that's my top offer.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $7000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $8200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. I'm open to negotiating further, but I'm not willing to go below $8000.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of the product, but $8200 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8000. That's my final offer, and I'm prepared to walk away if we can't agree.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $8400. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. I'm open to negotiating further, but I'm not willing to go below $8000.",8400.0,Alice,5,
