"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. I think it's a fair price considering its value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. It's wise to see if Alice is willing to go lower before committing."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $7,000?  I'm serious about buying it, but that's my top offer."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $7000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $8200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. I'm open to negotiating further, but I'm not willing to go below $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit from her initial offer, but there's still room to negotiate. Since I'm willing to pay up to $15,000 for the product, I'm going to try and get a better price by counter-offering again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on the value of the product, but $8200 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8000. That's my final offer, and I'm prepared to walk away if we can't agree."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $8400. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. I'm open to negotiating further, but I'm not willing to go below $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my offer, and I'm only $400 away from my ideal price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk she'll walk away.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer to secure the product and avoid the potential of having to pay John's higher price."
