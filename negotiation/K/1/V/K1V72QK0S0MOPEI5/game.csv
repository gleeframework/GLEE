"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $140. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160? It's a fair price considering the value the product brings",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  $160 is still a bit high for me. How about $155? That's a fair price for both of us.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. I can do $162, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. It's the lowest I can go and still make a profit",162.0,Alice,5,
