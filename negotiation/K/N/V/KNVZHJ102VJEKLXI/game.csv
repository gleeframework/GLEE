"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. This feels like a fair starting point, given the potential benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  This reflects a fair price considering the potential benefits and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of the product. While $1,200,000 is a significant offer, it falls short of what I believe is a fair reflection of its potential to you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This acknowledges your budget considerations while ensuring a price that reflects the product's true worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while respecting my budget. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product holds. I respect your negotiating skills and how you've approached this. To find a solution that works for both of us, I'm willing to come down slightly more. How about $1,275,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end and feels like a fair deal considering its worth to both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
