""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $14,000 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down a bit, selling for anything above $12,000 (John's offer) is a win for Alice."
