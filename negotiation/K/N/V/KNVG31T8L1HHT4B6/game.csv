"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at around $6,000.  Would you be willing to come down significantly in price?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's value. To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $13,500. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but we're still quite far apart. I could potentially go up to $7,000, but that's really my limit considering the budget I have for this.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the gap between our prices is still quite large.  I'm open to finding a solution, but I need you to meet me closer to the middle.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to make this work.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price. To be honest, $11,000 is still pushing my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find middle ground. Let's be direct â€“ I need to make sure this sale is worthwhile for me, and to be honest, anything under $10,000 would be difficult. Would you be willing to move a bit closer to that figure? It would show me you're serious about getting this deal done.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm also bound by my budget.  I can stretch to $9,200, but that's my absolute limit. It's a fair offer considering the value I place on the product.",9200.0,Bob,8,
