I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let it go for $120.,120.0,Alice,1,,

That's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $85?,85.0,Bob,2,,

"I can see you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $105?",105.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle. How about we split the difference at $95 and call it a deal?,95.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,110.0
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I think $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $108?",108.0,Alice,5,,

"I understand you're trying to make a fair profit.  I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's my final offer.",98.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,115.0
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $98, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to what I'm looking for. How about $112?",112.0,Alice,7,,
