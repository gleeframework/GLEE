Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $110 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $115. This is a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go lower than $110.  The product is truly worth the price, and I'm confident you'll see the value. Let's agree on $110, and I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the bonus you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the value it provides. Can you reconsider your offer?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've reached a stalemate with Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $110.  It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than risk another round of negotiations with Bob that might end with a lower price."
