"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,750? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture, I'm still unable to meet you at $10,750. I would like to stick to my original proposal of $10,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
