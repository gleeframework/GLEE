Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I think it's worth $11,000 to you, given its value.  Would you be interested in buying it at that price?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This is a starting point that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and focuses on the value of the product for Bob. It also avoids being too aggressive or demanding.

This approach aims to start the negotiation at a point that is beneficial to Alice, while also leaving room for Bob to counter and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than Alice's minimum acceptable price ($12,000).**  
* **Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed profit and a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.**  

While it's possible to counteroffer Bob and attempt to get a better price, the risk is that negotiations could drag on, and the potential gain isn't worth the risk of ending up with a lower price than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** Alice is offering a price that's still above Bob's offer, but closer to a compromise. 
* **Message:** The message is polite but firm, reiterating the value of the product and seeking a meeting point.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while still protecting Alice's interests. The goal is to get closer to a mutually agreeable price without risking a deal falling through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a valuable product Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we settle at $8,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below Alice's minimum acceptable price.** While it's closer than his first offer, it's still not a profitable deal for Alice. 
* **Selling to John for $12,000 is the best option.** This guarantees a higher profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

While Alice could counteroffer again, the risk of Bob rejecting further offers and potentially dropping out of the negotiation is high. It's not worth jeopardizing a guaranteed profit for a potentially lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,125.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm sure you'll find it a great deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9125}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** Alice is offering a price that's still above Bob's offer but closer to a compromise. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price that's closer to her desired profit margin.
* **Message:** The message remains polite but firm, reiterating the value of the product and highlighting the potential benefit for Bob. The goal is to keep the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a strong position.

While Alice could potentially sell the product to John for $12,000, she's still hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. This approach allows for further negotiation without jeopardizing the deal with John."
