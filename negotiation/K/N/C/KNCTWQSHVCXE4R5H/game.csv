"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you considering my budget. While I love the product, $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be open to $11,500? I'm serious about buying this, and this is the best I can do right now.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can make this work.",12500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you at $13,500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let's meet at $14,000, and we can finalize the deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
