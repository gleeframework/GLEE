"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $50 is a good price, but you can likely get it for less. There are 9 rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 30}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. This price is a good starting point, leaving room for potential compromise in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $40. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $40
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer, but I believe I can get it lower still.  There are 7 rounds remaining and I want to see if Alice will budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 35}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price lower than Alice's offer. With 6 rounds left, there's still time to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $45. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $45
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has moved closer to my last offer, and we are now only $5 apart.  With only 5 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. Accepting this offer is a good compromise, and I can still save $5 compared to buying from John."
