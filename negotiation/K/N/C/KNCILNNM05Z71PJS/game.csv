"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be thrilled with your purchase.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested in the product, $120 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105. Would you be open to that?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a little out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $110.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $112.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $112.50 is still a bit too much for me. How about $111? It's just a small difference, and I think it would be a fair compromise. ",111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $111 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $112. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise to get the deal done.",112.0,Alice,7,
