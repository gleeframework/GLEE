```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $115 is still a little out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $110.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $112.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, her offer is still above my target of $150.  I'll continue to negotiate for a lower price.  It's worth trying to get a better deal, especially since I have a fallback option with John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $112.50 is still a bit too much for me. How about $111? It's just a small difference, and I think it would be a fair compromise. "", ""product_price"": 111}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $111 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $112. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112 is still above my target price of $150. However, it's only slightly above and it's becoming increasingly clear that she's unwilling to go lower. Considering the possibility of buying from John at $150 and that I only have 3 rounds left, it's strategically beneficial to accept this offer."
