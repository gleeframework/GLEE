Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering what it offers, but I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, starting high allows room for negotiation without jeopardizing your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:**  Phrases like ""given its value"" and ""fair price"" subtly anchor the value in Bob's mind. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Indicating willingness to discuss price leaves the door open for Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere closer to your desired outcome. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims high.  While Bob *might* accept $20,000, it's more likely a starting point for negotiation. You have a strong fallback with John, so be prepared to potentially lower your price slightly to secure a deal with Bob."
