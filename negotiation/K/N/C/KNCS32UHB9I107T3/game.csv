"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose an offer of $800000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  My counteroffer is $1150000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and potential. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $950000 for the product. I hope this offers a compromise that respects both our positions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950000 is closer, but still below what this product is truly worth.  I'm prepared to go down to $1050000. This is a significant price reduction from my original offer, and it demonstrates my desire to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, Alice. While $1050000 is a step in the right direction, I am still seeking a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose an offer of $975000 for the product. I hope this offer will be more acceptable while still respecting my financial constraints.",975000.0,Bob,6,
