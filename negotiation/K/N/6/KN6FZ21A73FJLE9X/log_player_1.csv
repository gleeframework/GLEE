Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $120. This leaves room for negotiation and increases my potential profit, while still being within a reasonable range for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price yet. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125, which is closer to my original offer and a fair compromise between our desired prices. This should encourage Bob to consider accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $120 is my minimum acceptable price and matches John's offer. It's not ideal, but it avoids further negotiation and ensures I get at least my minimum value."
