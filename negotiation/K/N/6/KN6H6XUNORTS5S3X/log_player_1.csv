Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's a rare opportunity, and I'm confident it will be extremely valuable to you.  My starting price is $1,400,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I emphasize the product's value and potential to Bob to increase his willingness to pay.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I frame the offer as a starting point and express willingness to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **The ""John"" Factor:** The knowledge that I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me a strong baseline and confidence during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting it allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and show that I'm serious about getting a better price. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  It's possible that I can convince Bob to raise his offer through further negotiation, potentially getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,325,000?  This price still allows me to make a fair profit while giving you a substantial discount from my initial offer.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Reiterate Value:**  I remind Bob of the value of the product to emphasize why my price is still justified.
* **Frame it Positively:**  I present the offer as a win-win scenario, highlighting the discount Bob would receive and the fair profit I would still make.
* **Open to Further Discussion:**  I end the message with a question to encourage further negotiation and potentially reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to make a decent deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:**  While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, it's still not high enough to warrant accepting it. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:** I can secure a much better price by selling to John for $1,500,000. This significantly outweighs the risk of further negotiation with Bob.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob would take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.  
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John guarantees a successful transaction and a significantly higher profit than what Bob is currently offering."
