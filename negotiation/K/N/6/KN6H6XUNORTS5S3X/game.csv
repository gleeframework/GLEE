"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,250,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,325,000?  This price still allows me to make a fair profit while giving you a substantial discount from my initial offer.  What do you think?",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows both of us to make a decent deal.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
