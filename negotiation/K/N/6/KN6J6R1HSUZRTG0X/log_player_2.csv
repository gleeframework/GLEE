"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for the price of $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate down towards a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:** This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, showing that I'm serious about getting a better deal.
* **Staying Above Alice's Value:**  While I want to save money, I also want to ensure my offer is attractive enough for Alice to consider.  $9,000 still gives her a profit margin.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm prepared to go a little higher if needed, but this starting point gives us space to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $10,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still a significant markup from her $8,000 value. 
* **Pressure from John's Offer:**  John's $12,000 offer serves as a good upper limit.  I don't want to drag the negotiation too long and risk Alice backing out, leaving me with the less desirable option.
* **Aiming for a Win-Win:**  I'll try one more counteroffer that's closer to $10,000 but still gives me some savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counter-offer meets Alice halfway between her $10,000 counter and my $9,000 offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By framing it as a ""fair compromise"", I'm signaling that I'm motivated to close the deal and avoid further back-and-forth.
* **Staying Below John's Price:** At $9,500, I'm still saving $2,500 compared to buying from John, making this a desirable outcome."
