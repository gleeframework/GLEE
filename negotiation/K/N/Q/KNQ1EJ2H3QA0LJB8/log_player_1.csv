Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I think you'll find it incredibly valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $100 as possible, since that's my guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's inclined, potentially earning me even more. 
* **Highlight Value:**  By emphasizing the product's value to Bob, I increase the chance he'll be willing to pay a price above his perceived $80 worth.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
