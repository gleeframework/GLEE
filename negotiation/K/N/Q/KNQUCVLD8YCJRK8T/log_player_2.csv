"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can get the product for a much lower price than $900,000. Since you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, it makes sense to try and negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better deal.  There's still room for a counteroffer that might be beneficial to both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. It's a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. The goal is to see if Alice is willing to accept a price closer to her own valuation of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still within your budget and represents a good deal. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or counter with a higher price. It's more advantageous to accept the offer and secure the product at a price that's better than what John is offering."
