Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial ask, I'm confident we can reach a more agreeable price.  I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $12,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we try something around $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob is clearly interested but trying to get a good deal. His offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I need to decide if I want to push for a bit more or take what's guaranteed.  

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While I could potentially squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth the risk of him walking away completely. Accepting John's offer guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
