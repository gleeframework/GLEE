Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1000000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to invest closer to $800000.  I believe this is still a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $1,000,000. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget. However, $800,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference.  How about $850000?  This allows for both of us to get closer to our desired price.  What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $850,000 which is closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to get even closer, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting his offer ensures a solid profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiations."
