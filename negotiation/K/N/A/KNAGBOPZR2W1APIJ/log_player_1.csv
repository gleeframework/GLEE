"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest level and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter with a lower price, but still aiming for a profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering the price slightly to be more appealing, but still aiming for a significant profit. If Bob is serious about buying, he should be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still not a good enough price. I believe I can do better.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'm starting to think about selling to John if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm coming down to a price closer to Bob's last offer, but still aiming for a reasonable profit. This is my last offer before I seriously consider selling to John. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll likely take the guaranteed $800,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm running out of rounds.  I'm not confident that I can get a higher price from Bob, so I'm going to sell to John for the guaranteed $800,000. It's not the ideal outcome, but it's a safe and secure deal."
