"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least that much to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum valuation. You should reject and propose a counteroffer closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. It leaves room for negotiation while signaling your strong interest in staying below your $12,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $11,500? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming closer to your acceptable price, but you're still not at your limit.  Rejecting and countering again keeps the negotiation open.  You might be able to get the price down a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $10,500. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

We're moving closer to a potential deal. This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but also sets a firm target that's still comfortably below your maximum."
