Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first because I think you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $200. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150 gives you leverage.  Bob doesn't need to know about John specifically, but your confidence might signal the product's value.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating it, the phrase ""because I think you'll find it valuable"" subtly implies the product is worth the asking price. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
