Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $250 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be interested in purchasing if the price was closer to $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $200. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200

Alice's offer is still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $200 is still a little high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is firm at $150.  Would you be willing to go down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is your firm budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still above your budget. While $175 is closer, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You've already spent several rounds negotiating, and it doesn't seem like Alice is going to come down further.  It's time to move on to John."
