"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $250 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'd be interested in purchasing if the price was closer to $125.  What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $200. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $200 is still a little high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is firm at $150.  Would you be willing to go down to that price?",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is your firm budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,5,
