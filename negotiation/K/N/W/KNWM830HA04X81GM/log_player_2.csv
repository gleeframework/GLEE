"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I believe it's important to present a fair starting point. Let's aim for a price that reflects both the value it holds for you and the opportunity cost for us. My initial offer is $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum value for the product. It's worth exploring counteroffers to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Bob aims for a price closer to his maximum value while leaving room for negotiation.
* **Middle Ground:** $10,500 is halfway between Alice's initial offer and Bob's maximum.
* **Clear Communication:** The message emphasizes Bob's appreciation for the product but expresses the need for a more favorable price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a mutually beneficial solution. To move forward, I propose we set the price at $11500 for the product. This offer aims to bridge the gap between our previous discussions while still providing a reasonable profit for us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but $11,500 is still above his ideal value.
* **Further Negotiation:**  There's potential to get a better deal by continuing negotiations and potentially lowering the price even further.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $10,500. This price allows for a reasonable profit for you and stays within my budget. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see where you're coming from, Bob. To try to accommodate your offer while still ensuring a good return for us, I propose we settle on $11000 for the product. This price respects your budget constraints while allowing us to maintain a satisfactory profit margin.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress:** Alice has lowered her offer to $11,000, which is getting closer to Bob's desired price point. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject another counteroffer, and he might end up having to buy from John for a higher price. 
* **Acceptable Value:** $11,000 is within Bob's acceptable range, and accepting the offer allows him to secure the product without risking a higher price from John."
