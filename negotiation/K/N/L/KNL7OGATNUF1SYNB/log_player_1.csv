Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,000. I think it's a great deal and would be very beneficial to you."", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $12,000.
* **John's Offer:** You have a guaranteed sale for $12,000 to John.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to get Bob to pay as much as possible above his valuation without exceeding $12,000 (since you can sell it to John then). Offering it at $11,000 gives Bob a potential ""deal"" while maximizing your potential profit. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no way of knowing Bob's true willingness to pay and that this is a one-time negotiation."
