"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This sets a high bar for Bob and gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I'm confident the product is worth more than $800,000 to me, so I'm not afraid to start high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $750,000 is too low for me, even though it's better than selling to John. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to find a price that works for both of us before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer to get more, I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to settle with John for the same amount. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and allows me to move on."
