"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true value to you."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value, we establish a good negotiating position and leave room for potential concessions.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""potential"" and ""true value"" subtly emphasizes its worth to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it signals that we're open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably below his perceived value of the product ($1,500,000).  We have room to negotiate and aim for a better price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be leaving a lot of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. To move this forward, I propose a price of $1,350,000. This reflects a willingness to compromise while still recognizing the product's true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Counter:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and counter-argument but stand firm that his valuation is too low. 
* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession from our initial offer ($1,400,000 to $1,350,000) to show flexibility. 
* **Reiterate Value:**  We continue to subtly emphasize the product's value to justify the higher price point. 
* **Urgency (Implied):**  By suggesting this moves things ""forward,"" we subtly create a sense that time is a factor (even though we have several rounds left)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm proposing a price of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to move forward if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his negotiation strategy of ""meeting halfway,"" which is slowly chipping away at the price. While $1,250,000 is a good offer, we are still in the early stages of the negotiation, and Bob has clearly shown interest in the product. We can risk another counteroffer to see if we can push closer to $1,300,000.  We are not desperate to sell to John for $1,000,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. Let's cut to the chase: I can't sell this product for anything less than $1,300,000. It's a final offer.  I believe it's a fair deal considering the value you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  We've moved past the back-and-forth and made it clear that $1,300,000 is our bottom line. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By calling it a ""final offer"" we introduce a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Focus on Value:** We reiterate the benefit to Bob to emphasize why the price is justified. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  There's a risk that Bob could walk away, but given his repeated offers, it's likely he's still very interested and willing to negotiate around this price point. We're still significantly above our fallback option of John's $1,000,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're firm on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with the cost. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a price of $1,280,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay, and I hope we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has made it clear this is his final offer. While it's slightly below our target, holding out for more could make him walk away. 
* **Excellent Profit:** $1,280,000 is still a substantial profit margin above our $1,000,000 minimum and a good compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. It's better to secure a very good offer now than risk getting stuck with John's lower offer later."
