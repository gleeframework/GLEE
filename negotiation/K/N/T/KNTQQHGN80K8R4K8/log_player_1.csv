"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening high:** Starting with a price of $1,000,000 is a good opening move. It leaves room for negotiation and indicates the product's value to me.
* **Framing it positively:** Emphasizing the ""great deal"" for Bob helps to build goodwill and sets a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm indicating a willingness to find a ""mutually beneficial price,"" which signals flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this deal. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.**  While it's closer to my value, I'm aiming for at least $1,200,000.
* **I have more negotiation rounds:**  There's still time to potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,200,000 gives me leverage and a backup plan.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and see if we can find a more favorable price for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 isn't quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's still a good value for you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer with a compromise:**  While I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I'm showing flexibility by coming down slightly from my initial price. This signals that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize that $950,000 is still a good value for Bob.
* **Emphasize compromise:** I explicitly state that I'm making a ""significant compromise"" to demonstrate my willingness to meet halfway.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being appealing to Bob. 
* This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward while keeping my leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some more. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough for me to consider selling. 
* **More negotiation rounds available:** I have six more rounds to potentially get a better price.
* **John's offer is my safety net:**  The offer from John provides me with a solid backup option.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and explore if we can reach a price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $920,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm going to stand firm at $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great product at a competitive rate.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Standing Firm:**  I'm reiterating my previous offer, emphasizing that it's a fair price. This shows I'm not willing to keep lowering my price too much, but I'm still open to a deal.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the price as a ""good price"" and ""competitive rate"" for Bob.
* **Urgency:** I add ""Let's close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* I'm hoping that by standing firm and emphasizing the value proposition, Bob might be more inclined to accept my offer. 
* However, if he rejects again, I'll have to consider my options for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $930,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough for me to consider selling.
* **Limited negotiation rounds left:** With only four rounds remaining, I need to be strategic and aim for a price that's more favorable to me.
* **John's offer is my safety net:**  I can still sell to John for a significantly higher price, so there's no pressure to settle for a lower offer.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'll be more firm in my stance. I'll aim for a price closer to my desired range, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll be prepared to sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest. However, $930,000 is still not meeting my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to go down to $940,000, which is a significant concession on my part.  This is my final offer â€“ let's make this deal happen.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll be forced to pursue other options."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling that this is my final concession, creating a sense of urgency and prompting Bob to consider accepting.
* **Significant Concession:**  I emphasize that this is a ""significant concession"" to highlight my willingness to compromise.
* **Consequence:**  I mention the possibility of pursuing ""other options"" (referring to John's offer) to add pressure to Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price closer to my desired range while acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.  By setting a deadline and highlighting the potential consequences, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your final offer, Alice, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. This is my last offer - if you can't meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  Even though it's his ""final offer,"" it's still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:**  We are down to the last two rounds, and there's a high chance we won't reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's offer is significantly higher:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is much better than Bob's offer. 

**Strategy:**

With limited time and Bob's offer being too low, it's strategically advantageous to sell to John and secure a much better deal. This minimizes the risk of not closing the deal and allows me to get a price closer to my initial value."
