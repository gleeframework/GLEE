Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $175 for it."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $175, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** It's important to leave some room for negotiation. If I start too low, I might miss out on potential profit. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I have John as a backup buyer, which means I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested in the product. This gives me the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John is a secure option:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating without feeling pressured."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130.  This still leaves some room for profit for me, but it's also a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $175 to $130. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reasonable price:**  $130 is still above Bob's offer but closer to his perceived value, making it more likely for him to accept.
* **Maintain Profit:**  This price still allows me to make a profit while avoiding a sale that would result in a loss.
* **Clear Communication:** I'm stating my reasoning for the counteroffer, demonstrating transparency and understanding."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $115. This would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Further negotiation unlikely to yield a better price:**  Bob is clearly trying to get the product for as low a price as possible, and further negotiation may only result in more rounds of haggling without significant progress.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John ensures I receive $150, which is a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob.

Given that John offers a secure and profitable option, I choose to sell to him rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
