"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for a limited time at the special price of $120. It's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $120. This is far too expensive for Bob. He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm interested in your product but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go lower than $110. This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his $80 limit. Bob should continue negotiating, as he can potentially get a better deal or purchase the product from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $110. How about we split the difference and settle at $95? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
