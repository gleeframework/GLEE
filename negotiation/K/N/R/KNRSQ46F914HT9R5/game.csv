"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm not quite ready to pay $120. I'd be willing to buy it for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if that's something you'd be comfortable with.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $130 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $115? Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're still in the conversation. I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $115. How about we compromise at $125? I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go up a little from my last offer.  Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? That way we can both walk away with a decent deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with $120. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think you're getting a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $127.50? I'll give you a slight discount, but I still need to make a profit.",127.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to compromise, and I appreciate that.  $127.50 is still a little higher than I'd like to pay.  How about we split the difference again at $123.75? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",123.75,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where I should consider other offers. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think you're really getting a great deal. How about we meet at $129? I'll give you a small discount, but I still need to make a profit.",129.0,Alice,9,
