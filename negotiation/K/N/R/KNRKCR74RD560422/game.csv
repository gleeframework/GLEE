"I'm interested in the product, but I think $90 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $85, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $78? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $78 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $81?  It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",81.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $81 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $78 and $81, which would be $79.50. Can you consider that?",79.5,Bob,6,
