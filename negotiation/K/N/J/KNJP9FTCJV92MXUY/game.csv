"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is well above my budget.  I'm interested in this product but I can only offer $800,000 at this time. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, considering the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet halfway. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go a little higher, but I can't exceed $900,000. This reflects the product's value to me and what I'm able to afford.  Let's work together to bridge this gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  Let's find a solution. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a significant compromise, reflecting my best offer to close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle.  I can offer $1,000,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
