Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $900,000 is more than what the product is worth to Bob ($800,000), so he has incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This price is below your minimum of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **It's a friendly tone:**  The message is positive and encourages Bob to respond. 

By starting high but with room for negotiation, you can potentially secure a good price while still keeping John as a backup option if things fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired minimum of $1,000,000.  There's room for further negotiation, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.  John is also a viable option if this negotiation doesn't work out, so I'm not under pressure to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your budget constraints.  However, $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is close to Bob's offer:** By moving only $25,000 closer to Bob's offer, it shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly. 
* **It's still above my minimum:** $875,000 is still above my minimum of $1,000,000, which ensures I'm not losing money. 
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to accept the offer. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between securing a reasonable price and keeping the negotiation moving towards a successful agreement."
