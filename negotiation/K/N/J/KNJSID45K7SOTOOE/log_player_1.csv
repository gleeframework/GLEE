"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you!  I'm looking to get $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting high, at $100, knowing I'm willing to go down to $80.  This allows room for negotiation and gives me a chance to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer ensures I get the minimum value I'm comfortable with."
