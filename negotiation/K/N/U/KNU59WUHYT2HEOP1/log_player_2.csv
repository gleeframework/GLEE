Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, and I can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $118
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum, but it's still above what I'm comfortable paying. At this point, it's becoming a risk to continue negotiating. There's no guarantee I can get a better price from Alice, and it's possible she'll raise her offer even higher.  Buying from John for $120 guarantees I get the product and limits my potential loss."
