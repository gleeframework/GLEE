"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,350,000, as it's still a good deal for you and allows me to make some profit.  Let's meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,350,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,325,000.
