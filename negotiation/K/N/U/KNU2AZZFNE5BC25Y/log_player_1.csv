"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because it's more than my minimum and leaves some room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay this price since it's still less than the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While $110 is less than my initial offer, it's still a good deal for me, as it's more than my minimum selling price.  It's also likely that Bob won't budge further, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale completely."
