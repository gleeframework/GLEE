"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I've got a great deal for you! I'm selling this [product name] for a fantastic price. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $90.  This is a great opportunity to get a quality product at a discounted price!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer of $90 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $80 from John.  Your goal is to save as much money as possible, so buying from John is the most financially sound choice."
