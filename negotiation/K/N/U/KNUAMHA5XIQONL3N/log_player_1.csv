Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a bit higher than Bob's value for the product, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm also confident that I can sell the product to John for $120 if Bob rejects my offer, so I'm not afraid to lose the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $120. I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob or John, so I'm going to continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm offering $105. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still too low.  I've already had two rounds of negotiation, and it seems like Bob is not willing to meet me halfway.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120, which is a much more favorable outcome for me."
