"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price you've suggested. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product and the effort I've put into acquiring it.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $775,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $775,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do.",825000.0,Alice,5,
