After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $775,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. I'm offering it to you for $825,000. This is the best I can do.

Alice has come down significantly and is now only asking for $25,000 above her value.  Continuing to negotiate risks pushing her away from the deal. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price. Accepting at $825,000 secures a reasonable deal."
