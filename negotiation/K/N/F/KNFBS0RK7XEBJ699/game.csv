"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,500,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that respects both our positions.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident that this product's true value exceeds $1,500,000. Let's find a middle ground - how about we settle for $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand your position, I still believe the product's value does not justify a price higher than $1,500,000. Could we possibly meet in the middle at $1,625,000?",1625000.0,Bob,4,
