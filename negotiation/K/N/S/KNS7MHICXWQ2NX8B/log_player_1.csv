Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I believe would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $14,000. Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, aiming slightly below that maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $14,000 is a strong starting point, there's a chance Bob might negotiate. This leaves you space to potentially meet in the middle while still exceeding your minimum price.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 provides leverage. You don't *need* to go below that price."
