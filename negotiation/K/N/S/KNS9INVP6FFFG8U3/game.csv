"Thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit high for me. I'm interested in this product but my budget is $100. Would you be willing to come down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $125, but I'm not going any lower than that. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, but $125 is still a bit too much for me. How about we split the difference at $115? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",115.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $115 is a bit low. How about we meet at $130? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",130.0,Alice,7,
