Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $15000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $8000, which is the maximum I can pay for this product at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints.  What are your thoughts?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8000.  This is the maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $10500. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $10500 is closer to my budget, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to come down to $9000?  I truly believe this is a fair price considering the value we've discussed.  Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to reach an agreement, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make another adjustment and offer $10000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm very close to my budget limit, but I'm willing to go up to $9500. This is a serious offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price considering all our discussions. Let's close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,8,
