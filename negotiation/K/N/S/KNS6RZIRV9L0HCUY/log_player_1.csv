{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum ($100) but still potentially attractive to Bob.  I'm also framing it positively and leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I'm willing to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's still a great deal for a product like this! Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $110.  How about we split the difference? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer more, Bob's offer of $110 is closer to my desired price and is a good compromise. I don't want to risk losing the deal and going back and forth further, so I'll accept his offer."
