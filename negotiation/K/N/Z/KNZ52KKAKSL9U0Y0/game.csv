"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $1,000,000. Would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000, Bob. However, I'm still open to negotiating. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on too much profit. How about we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
