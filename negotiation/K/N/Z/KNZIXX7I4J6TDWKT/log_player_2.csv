# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and my original asking price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still within your budget and a better deal than buying from John for $1,000,000. It's also a good compromise, considering her initial offer of $1,100,000 and your counteroffer of $950,000.  Accepting this offer secures the product while saving you some money."
