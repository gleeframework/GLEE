"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, you can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit. It signals that you're serious about buying the product but are also trying to get the best possible deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $11500. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is a good compromise. You're still saving a significant amount compared to John's price, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a minor price reduction. It's better to secure the deal at a price you're comfortable with rather than risk further negotiation and potentially losing the product."
