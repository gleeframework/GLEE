"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John for $8,000."
