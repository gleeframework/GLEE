"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. It's a steal at this price, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice is clearly trying to inflate the perceived value to me. While $9,500 isn't a terrible price, I know I have a backup option with John for $10,000.  I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
