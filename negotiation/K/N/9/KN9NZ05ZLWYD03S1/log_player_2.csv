Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you halfway between $12,000 and $11,250, which is $11,625. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting the offer at $11,625 saves a significant amount compared to John's $15,000 price."
