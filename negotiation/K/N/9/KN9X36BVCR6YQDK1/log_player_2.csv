"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice is offering it for $95. While this is a good deal, it's still more than what you would pay John. You can get the product for a better price from John."
