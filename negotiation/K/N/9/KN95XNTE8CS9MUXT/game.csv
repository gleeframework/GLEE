"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $800000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $1150000?  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $1150000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $800000, so I'll offer $950000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $1050000 for the product.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,6,
