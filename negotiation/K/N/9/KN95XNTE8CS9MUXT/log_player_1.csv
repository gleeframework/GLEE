This offer sets a high starting point, reflecting the value you place on the product. It's important to show confidence in the value while leaving room for negotiation.  The message is friendly and invites Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price through counteroffers."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $800,000 is a good starting point, I'm not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $1150000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $800000, so I'll offer $950000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable accepting.  I'll see if I can push for a bit more with a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000 for the product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:

It seems like Bob and I are not going to reach an agreement. While $900,000 is a substantial amount, it is still below my minimum. I'm going to take the sure thing and sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
