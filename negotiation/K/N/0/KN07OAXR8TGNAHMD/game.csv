"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's worth to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $14,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $11,000? That's a fair offer considering its true value to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
