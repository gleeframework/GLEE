Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $10,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's worth to you is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair for both of us. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. Considering the product's worth to you is $12,000, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed price of $12,000 with John."
