{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $110, which is a good middle ground between my minimum price ($120) and Bob's perceived value ($80).  This gives Bob room to negotiate, but also leaves me with a decent profit margin.
* **Positive tone:**  A positive and enthusiastic message encourages Bob to engage with the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, as this shows I'm flexible and willing to work with him. 
* **John as a backup:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $120, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price. This gives me confidence during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a budget. Can you meet me at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob is willing to pay a premium, his offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. Accepting would mean losing money.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I have a backup buyer in John who will pay $120.  This gives me leverage to continue negotiating with Bob and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, giving us both a chance to find a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $100?  That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90). This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to meet him halfway.
* **Emphasis on value:** I remind Bob that $100 is still a ""good deal"" for him, highlighting the value of the product.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains positive and encouraging, aiming to keep the negotiation friendly and open to agreement. 
* **Open to further negotiation:** I end the message by inviting Bob to ""find common ground,"" implying that I'm still open to discussing the price further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $100 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your original offer and my initial counteroffer. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Time and effort:**  Further negotiation with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, but it's likely to be time-consuming and involve more back-and-forth.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  John is a guaranteed buyer at $120, ensuring a significant profit.  The potential for a few more dollars with Bob isn't worth the risk of delaying the sale and potentially getting a worse deal. 

**In summary,  selling to John offers a faster, more certain, and more profitable outcome.**"
