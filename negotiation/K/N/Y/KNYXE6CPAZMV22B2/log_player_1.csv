Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation.  If he's not interested at this price, we can go back and forth until we find a price that works for both of us. 

**Why not go higher?**

While I could start higher, I want to keep the initial offer somewhat reasonable. An outrageous price might immediately deter Bob and make him less likely to engage in negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for it right away. Bob's immediate counteroffer shows he's willing to negotiate, and I believe I can potentially get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial $20,000 offer, showing flexibility. It's also a significant increase from Bob's $15,000 offer. Hopefully, this will encourage him to come up a bit more before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $1,000 below my initial asking price and a significant increase from his previous offer. This is a good deal for me, considering I'm guaranteed to make a profit and avoid any further negotiation. I'm not willing to risk losing this opportunity by rejecting the offer and potentially ending up with John's offer of $15,000."
