"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. I believe this price is a fair reflection of the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1250000. I'm willing to pay $1150000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to meet my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $1300000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the same price you initially offered. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the fact that we've already discussed this price before.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
