"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $10,500?  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $10,500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is my maximum.  Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
