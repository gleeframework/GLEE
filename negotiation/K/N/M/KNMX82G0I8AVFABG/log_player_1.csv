"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $950,000.  This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious but still reasonable offer. This leaves room for concessions and gives the impression that the product is highly valued.
* **Highlighting Value:**  By emphasizing the product's worth and potential, I aim to justify the high price and pique Bob's interest.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While my initial offer is high, it's still below Bob's perceived value, allowing for a potential win-win outcome through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $850,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below his perceived value of $1,000,000. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter in Round 3 to try and secure a better deal. I'm not ready to settle for John's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and aiming for a collaborative negotiation.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession of $50,000 to show flexibility, but I'm still holding firm above $850,000.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify the adjusted price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $800,000 is a more reasonable price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $825,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to anchor the price lower, but his offer of $825,000 is still too far from his perceived value and my minimum. I'm willing to push a bit further in the negotiation since we still have rounds left.  I'll counter with an offer closer to my minimum but leaving a small margin for a final concession."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground. Let's make this happen - I'm willing to accept $875,000. This is a significant investment for you, but I truly believe it's worth it given the value you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm injecting a bit of urgency to encourage Bob to close the deal sooner rather than later.
* **Final Offer (Almost):** This is getting very close to my absolute minimum. I'm hoping Bob recognizes this as a final push for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Highlighting Value (Again):** I'm reiterating the product's value proposition to remind Bob why this deal is worthwhile, even at a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000. I'm willing to go up to $850,000, but that's as high as I can go. Please consider this my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is a Factor:**  We're past the halfway point of the negotiations, and while I have rounds left, there's no guarantee Bob will significantly increase his offer.
* **Strong Offer:**  $850,000 is a solid price and a substantial profit over my minimum. Holding out for more might risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **""Final Offer"" Psychology:**  Bob has indicated this is his best offer. While it might not be truly final, it suggests he's less likely to move significantly. 

It's a good idea to take the win now rather than risk getting a lower offer or reaching an impasse with Bob."
