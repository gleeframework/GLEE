# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value for you, worth $1,500,000 in your eyes. I am offering this exceptional item to you at a special price of $1,200,000. This is a chance to secure a remarkable asset at a price that offers significant savings compared to its true worth. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can make this transaction beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  While you could reject her offer and go to John, you'd end up paying the full $1,500,000. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000, which is the best outcome for you."
