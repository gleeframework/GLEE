{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  He's getting a good deal at $10,000 compared to his perceived value of $8,000.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **It leaves room for a counteroffer:** Bob is likely to counteroffer, and you'll be able to adjust your price based on his response. 

Remember, you can always sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than Bob's initial perceived value of $8,000, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to your target. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $8,500 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  This would still give you a great deal, and it gets us closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 9250}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Is closer to your desired price:**  $9,250 is a significant step up from Bob's offer of $8,500.
* **Shows willingness to compromise:** You're demonstrating a desire to reach an agreement, but you're also holding firm on your value.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob still refuses, you can always adjust your offer again. 

Remember, you can always fall back on selling to John for $12,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8800, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,800 is closer to your minimum price than Bob's previous offer, it's still below your desired price and leaves little room for future negotiations. You can potentially try one more counteroffer to see if you can bridge the gap, but there's a real risk that you'll end up selling to John for $12,000. You'll need to weigh the potential of reaching a deal with Bob against the certainty of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to keep trying to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $9,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Is a final compromise:** $9,000 is only $200 away from Bob's offer.
* **Shows you're willing to meet him halfway:** By coming down to $9,000, you're showing that you're serious about finding a deal.
* **Sets a firm limit:**  It leaves no further room for negotiation, making it clear that this is your best offer.

At this point, you're taking a calculated risk. If Bob rejects this offer, you'll likely move on to selling to John for $12,000.  It's up to you to decide if the potential of a slightly lower price from Bob is worth the risk of losing the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8750, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $8,750 is closer to your minimum acceptable price than his previous offer, it's still a significant distance from your desired price.  At this point, it's better to cut your losses and move on to the guaranteed sale with John.  Further negotiations with Bob are unlikely to lead to a satisfactory price for you, and continuing could risk losing the deal with John altogether."
