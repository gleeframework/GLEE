,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $8500 is a little lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $9250?  This would still give you a great deal, and it gets us closer to where I need to be.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8800, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to keep trying to find a solution that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $9000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I'm hoping we can reach a final agreement.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,5,
