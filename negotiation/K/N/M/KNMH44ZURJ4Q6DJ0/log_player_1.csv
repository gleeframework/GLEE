"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it's worth $180.  Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $180 allows for a bit of wiggle room if Bob counters with a lower price, but still gives me a good starting point.
* **Being polite and friendly:**  A friendly message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $85 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Bob's offer shows he's interested, and I can try to get closer to my desired price in the next round.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** While $150 isn't ideal, John is a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall apart. I can still make a profit and avoid losing money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still higher than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlight fairness:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Stay polite and positive:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiations open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit out of my range.  How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **I'm willing to negotiate further:** I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, but I'm still open to finding a middle ground. 
* **John is a guaranteed sale:**  I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $150, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is still too far below my minimum price. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $120?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise again:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasis on fairness:**  I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair solution to help Bob see it as a win-win.
* **Urgency:** I'm mentioning closing the deal to nudge Bob towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $110.  This is a fair price, and it would allow us to close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $110 is closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **I have a guaranteed sale with John:**  I can sell to John for $150, making a larger profit.
* **Time is running out:**  We're halfway through the rounds, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob, potentially lowering the price even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $110 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  To close this deal, I'm willing to go down to $115. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  This is my last counteroffer, signaling that I'm serious about closing the deal. 
* **Slightly higher than Bob's offer:**  I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's latest offer but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to encourage Bob to accept."
