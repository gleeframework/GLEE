"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $180 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit out of my range.  How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is still too far below my minimum price. Let's split the difference â€“ how about $120?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could close the deal.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $120 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $110.  This is a fair price, and it would allow us to close the deal.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $110 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  To close this deal, I'm willing to go down to $115. This is my final offer.",115.0,Alice,7,
