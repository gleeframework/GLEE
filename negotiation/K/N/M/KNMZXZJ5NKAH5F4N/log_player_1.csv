"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $12,000. This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob accepts, I'll earn more than my minimum value.
* **Set the tone:**  A high initial offer establishes a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  I'm prepared to lower the price in subsequent rounds if necessary. 

It's crucial to balance the desire for a high price with the need to close the deal within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable value.  While I'd prefer to earn more, accepting his offer ensures I secure the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation.  

* **Pros:** 
    * Guaranteed sale at my minimum value.
    * No risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price. 
* **Cons:**
    *  I'm not maximizing profit.

Given the limited rounds, I'm prioritizing certainty over potentially maximizing profit."
