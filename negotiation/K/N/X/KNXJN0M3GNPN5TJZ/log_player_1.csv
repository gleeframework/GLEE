{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  Giving him some room to negotiate.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:**  Leaving you room to negotiate down.
* **It's a round number:**  Easy to understand and work with. 

I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counterpropose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our mutual interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum value, but I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this price."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

This counteroffer maintains a firm stance while still giving Bob some room to negotiate. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Bob's offer is just a bit below my minimum, but it's close enough.  I'm happy to accept his counteroffer.  It's better than selling to John, and it seems like we've reached a good compromise."
