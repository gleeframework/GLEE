Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value & Certainty:** Offering it directly to Bob at a price slightly below his valuation might be more appealing to him than the risk of someone else buying it if it were listed publicly. This introduces an element of time value and certainty for Bob.

This strategy balances getting the best possible price from Bob while still ensuring that Alice sells the product at a price above her minimum."
