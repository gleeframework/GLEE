"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I think the product's value is not as high as you do. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective, Bob.  However, I believe $1,800,000 undervalues the product's unique capabilities and potential for significant return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. This offer takes into account both our interests and ensures you acquire a truly valuable asset.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $2,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me and the market demand.",1900000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product, but I think we can do better.
