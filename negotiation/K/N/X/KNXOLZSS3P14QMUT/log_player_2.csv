"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $119 is close to your maximum budget, you can still try to get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. Alice might come back with a lower price, or you can always buy from John for $120."
