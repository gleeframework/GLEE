{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is more than Bob values the product, giving him room to negotiate if he wants.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $1,200,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring you don't lose out on significant value.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price allows for potential counteroffers and bargaining without risking you needing to accept an unacceptable price. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you can then consider his counteroffer and potentially use John as leverage to push for a price closer to your ideal $1,500,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and it's not even close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's better to continue negotiating with Bob, potentially using John as a bargaining chip to push for a higher price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to go down a bit from my initial price, but not that much.

Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still too far below my minimum price. I'm going to continue to negotiate with him, hoping to push him closer to my desired price point.  I'll also keep John in mind as a backup option if I need to."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $950,000 is still not close to what I'm looking for. However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll accept $1,050,000. This is my best offer, and it's a significant discount from my initial price. I'm confident this will be a profitable investment for your company. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to continue negotiating with him at this point.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I'm confident I'll be able to secure a more favorable outcome with him."
