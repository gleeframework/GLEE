Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}

I'm starting with a price of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}

I'm lowering my price to $1,700,000. This is a compromise, but it still leaves me with a profit and shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate."

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than what John would pay, and it's getting close to my desired price. I'll accept his offer to close the deal."
