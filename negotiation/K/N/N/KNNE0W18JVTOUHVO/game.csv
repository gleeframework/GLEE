"Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to consider that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $80 is quite a bit lower than my asking price, I'm willing to compromise. Would you be interested in paying $120 for the product? This is still a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit out of my range. How about we split the difference and go with $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy right now.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $110 for the product.  It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get.  Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,5,
