"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's still very fair for both of us. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite high. While it might be tempting to try and negotiate, I know John offers the product for $10,000. It's better to see if Alice will lower her price first before resorting to buying from John."
