"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $100 by many of our customers. Considering its quality and unique features, I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. I am offering it to you for $95, which is a fantastic deal considering its worth. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and preferences. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is above your $100 maximum. While she's trying to frame it as a good deal, you know you have the fallback option of buying from John for $100. By rejecting this offer, you keep the negotiation open and might prompt Alice to suggest a lower price."
