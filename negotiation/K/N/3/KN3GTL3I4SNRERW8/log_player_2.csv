Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $950,000 undervalues its potential.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,025,000 is close, but the product's unique nature warrants a slightly higher price. How about we settle at $1,040,000?  This reflects the value while hopefully remaining agreeable to you.
