"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $675000, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700000 and $675000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $685000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $685,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $685,000, which is within your budget and a decent price considering your initial goal of saving as much as possible. Accepting this offer means you'll save $115,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away and you having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
