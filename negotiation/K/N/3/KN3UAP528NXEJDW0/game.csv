"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1500000. This represents a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1500000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? This is a fair price that I believe is beneficial for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
