"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $850,000, which is still a good deal for him as it's well under his maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's also a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving room for Alice to counter with a slightly higher price if she wants to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $975,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still a significant amount of money.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $850,000. There's still a chance Alice might concede to a lower price to avoid losing the deal completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering $900,000. This is a compromise between his previous counteroffer of $850,000 and Alice's last offer of $975,000.  This price is still within Bob's budget and shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming to save as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $985,000 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  At this point, it's clear that Alice is not willing to negotiate significantly lower.  There's a high chance that further rounds of counteroffers will simply result in Alice raising the price again, or refusing to negotiate further. 

Therefore, Bob decides to cut his losses and buy the product from John for $1,200,000. This guarantees him the product and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might ultimately lead to a worse deal."
