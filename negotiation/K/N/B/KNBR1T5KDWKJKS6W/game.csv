"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and am open to discussing the details further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $2,300,000. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the market value and my budget constraints.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. While I understand your perspective, the value this product brings to your specific operations warrants a higher price point. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $2,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,700,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position and understand budget considerations are real.  However, I believe the true value of this product to your business is significantly more than your current offer reflects. Let's find a solution â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000, but that's my absolute limit.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm proposing a price of $1,550,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget constraints.",1550000.0,Bob,6,
