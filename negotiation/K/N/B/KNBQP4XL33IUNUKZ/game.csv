"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 was a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more to you than $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,100,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and it allows for a profitable transaction for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $1,100,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. While I value the product and want to make this deal happen, I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,100,000. This is the absolute highest I can go. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this now. ",1100000.0,Bob,6,
