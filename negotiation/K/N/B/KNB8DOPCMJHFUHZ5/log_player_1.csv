"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I believe I can offer you $100 for the product, which is within my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer of $100 is tempting, I know the product is worth $100 to John. There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I'd rather take the guaranteed $100 from John than risk getting less in further negotiations with Bob."
