"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a strong opening position, allowing for potential negotiation space.  I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to me, so I'm not losing out on anything if Bob rejects it.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more.  I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter with $18,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still a fair price considering the product's value to me. I hope this is attractive enough for Bob, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round to see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm keeping in mind that if things don't work out, I can always sell to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to counter with $17,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer and a compromise from my previous counteroffer.  I'm hoping this is a sweet spot that will be agreeable to both of us. We are getting closer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $16,500.  While I would love to get more, I'm getting closer to my minimum and don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob. This is a good compromise, and I don't want to keep going back and forth and risk him walking away.  It's a good outcome overall."
