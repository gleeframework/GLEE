"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $11,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too much for me.  Let's split the difference: I'm willing to pay $10,500. It's a fair price that lets you make a profit and allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I've got to think about my minimum requirements here. I'm willing to consider $11,500, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a good deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I think I can do a bit better than $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $11,200, but that's as close as I can get. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",11200.0,Alice,7,
