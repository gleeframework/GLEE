"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Based on my budget considerations, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation and we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand Alice, and I appreciate your position. However, based on my assessment, I am unable to meet at $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement that is acceptable to both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
