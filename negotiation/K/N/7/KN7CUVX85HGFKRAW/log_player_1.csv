{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum, but lower than Bob's maximum value.  It leaves room for negotiation while still giving you a healthy profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I want to get for the product. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $115 is a little lower than my ideal, it's still a profitable sale and above my minimum. I'm happy to close the deal with Bob rather than risk further negotiation or selling to John for less."
