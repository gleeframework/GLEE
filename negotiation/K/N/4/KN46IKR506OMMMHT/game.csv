"I'm not willing to go any lower than $9500, Bob. I'm at my absolute minimum price. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free installation service, which is normally worth $1000. So, the total value you'll be getting is $10500. I'm not budging any further on the price, but I'm willing to make this a more attractive offer.",9500.0,Alice,9,
