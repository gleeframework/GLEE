"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the competitive price, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? ",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a better return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $11,750? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,750 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go to $11,500. This feels like a fair compromise, considering your price and my target.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $12,200? It's a small step closer to your target, and I'm hoping it will be a fair compromise.",12200.0,Alice,5,
