"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me is $1500000. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more than $750000 to you.
