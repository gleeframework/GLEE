"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $12,500 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and meet at $13,250? That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a fair price for me.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $12,750 for the product.",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a tight budget, but $12,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000 as a final compromise. This way, we both get a fair deal.  What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,5,
