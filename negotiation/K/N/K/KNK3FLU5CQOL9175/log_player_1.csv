Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $14,000 is higher than your minimum price of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $14,000 is lower than Bob's perceived value of $15,000, giving him room to feel he's getting a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can lower your price a bit to potentially seal the deal. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while also keeping the negotiation open and potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still lower than I'd like to receive. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and reach a price closer to my initial offer.  I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $12,500 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and meet at $13,250? That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 13250}

Bob's offer:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable settling for that amount.  I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
