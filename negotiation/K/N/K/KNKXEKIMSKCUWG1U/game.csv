"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. How about we meet at $750,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $720,000? I feel that's a fair compromise.",720000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $720,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $765,000? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",765000.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not willing to go all the way down to $750,000.
