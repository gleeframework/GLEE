Send your offer to Bob.,"I'm excited to start the negotiation!

I'm offering the product to Bob at a price of {""product_price"": $15,000}."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'm considering Bob's offer...

I'm going to {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}. I think I can do better than $8,000, so I'll send Bob a counteroffer.

My counteroffer: The product price will be $12,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here is my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $12,500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'm considering Bob's offer again...

I'm going to {""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}. I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,500, as I think it's still worth more than that. I'll send Bob another counteroffer.

My counteroffer: The product price will be $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here is my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $11,000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","I'm considering Bob's offer again...

I'm going to {""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}. Since Bob's offer is now at $10,000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I already have another buyer, John, willing to pay the same price, I'll decide to sell the product to John instead of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
