"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $14000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $13000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that price?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down slightly to $13500. This is a very fair price for the value you'll receive. Let me know if this works for you!",13500.0,Alice,3,
