Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This is my first offer to Bob. I'm aiming for a price that's close to my maximum, but still leaves room for negotiation if needed.  I'm also emphasizing the value to him, which might make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is better than $10,000 from John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $14,000. I'll counter with a price that's closer to his offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $12,500?  That's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 
I'm counteroffering with $12,500. It's a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $11,000 and my previous offer of $14,000. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him while still allowing me to earn a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking to get closer to your asking price. How about we split the difference and settle at $11,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While $11,750 isn't my ideal price, it's significantly higher than what I'd get from John.  It's also a good compromise and shows that Bob is willing to negotiate.  At this point, the potential gains from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk of Bob walking away altogether."
