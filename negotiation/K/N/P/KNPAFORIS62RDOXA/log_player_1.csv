Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $800,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,200,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Value:** Highlighting the difference between my perceived value and Bob's helps frame the offer as beneficial for him.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  While I'm initially targeting Bob, my offer is not so high that I'm cutting off the possibility of a deal with John if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $500,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a huge loss.
* **Opportunity for Counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows his interest. There's potential to negotiate further and reach a more acceptable price.
* **John is Still an Option:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for a significantly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $500,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still gives you a great value considering your own assessment.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Not Too Much:**  $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still more than double Bob's initial offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Positive Framing:**  Emphasizing the ""great value"" for Bob, and focusing on a mutually beneficial solution, helps keep the negotiation positive and encourages further discussion. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, the offer isn't so low that I'm immediately giving in.  It still leaves room for further counteroffers if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $650,000? That's a fair offer considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  $650,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's higher than his first offer, it's not a significant enough jump to justify accepting.
* **Opportunity to Counter Again:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has shown some willingness to increase his offer.  There's still room for me to counter with a price closer to my target.
* **John is the Safety Net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John and secure my desired price. This gives me the flexibility to be patient and hold out for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $650,000 is still significantly below what this product is worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $800,000. This price reflects the value you see in the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  $800,000 is exactly halfway between my last offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($650,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Appealing to Value Again:**  Reminding Bob of his own assessment of the product's worth strengthens the justification for the price.
* **Maintaining a Buffer:**  While this offer is lower than my ideal, it still provides a comfortable profit margin and allows for further negotiations if needed.

This counteroffer aims to find a compromise that satisfies both parties, while keeping the possibility of selling to John as a fallback option."
