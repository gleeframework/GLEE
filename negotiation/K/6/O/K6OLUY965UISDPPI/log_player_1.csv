Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you have room to start high.  A price of $1,500,000 aims to secure a significant profit margin if Bob accepts.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, subtly suggesting it might be worth even more to Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains  conversational (""What do you think?"") to encourage Bob to engage in negotiation even if he initially balks at the price.

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while keeping the door open for Bob to accept a price above your minimum."
