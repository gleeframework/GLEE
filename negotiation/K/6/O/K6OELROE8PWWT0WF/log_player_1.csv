Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential, but is also fair. Please consider this offer carefully, as it may not be available for long.  I'm confident you'll find it to be a very worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This allows room for negotiation but still sets a high bar for Bob to meet.
* **Message:**  The message is intended to be polite and persuasive. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and hinting at the possibility of it being sold to someone else. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets a high price point and creates a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. I can then evaluate his offer and adjust my strategy accordingly. This approach aims to maximize my profits while keeping open the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  However, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price point. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my original offer, but still higher than his offer. This will show him that I'm willing to negotiate but I'm not desperate to sell. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, I'm still confident that this product holds even greater value than we've discussed. To reflect that and show my willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,350,000. This price point still ensures a fair return for me while offering you a substantial opportunity. I'm hopeful you'll find this to be a very attractive proposition."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm dropping the price to $1,350,000. This is a compromise, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my belief in the product's value and emphasizing the potential for growth. I'm also making it clear that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the farm.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering at $1,350,000, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also making it clear that I'm not desperate to sell.  This puts the pressure back on Bob to either accept my offer or make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my desired price point, but it's getting closer. However, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can still push for a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I will aim to get Bob to meet me halfway again, but I will be strategic in my wording to emphasize the product's value and my belief in a fair deal."

{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I respect your position and understand your desire for a fair deal. While I value your latest offer,  I still believe the true value of this product lies closer to my previous offer. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price reflects the unique potential of the product and represents a significant opportunity for you.  Let's finalize this deal and unlock its full value together."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price again to $1,300,000. This is a smaller drop than before, signaling that I'm getting closer to my limit.
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the potential of the product and suggesting that we're both close to a mutually beneficial agreement. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a higher price.  I'm hoping to convince Bob that $1,300,000 is a fair price for both of us, given the product's potential."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think we can find a better price. I'm willing to offer $1275000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is very close to my desired price range.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John.  While I would prefer a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a substantial profit. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to be pragmatic and prioritize a guaranteed sale. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might become frustrated and walk away, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for a lower price. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a solid profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
