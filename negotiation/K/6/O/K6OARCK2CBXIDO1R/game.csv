"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I have to consider my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $15,000.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,000 is still above what I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a profit. Let's work together to find a solution.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $14,000 as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $15,000, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference again - I'm offering $13,500.  This is my final offer, and if we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to look at other options.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your limit, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $14,500. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $15,000. My counteroffer is $14,250.",14250.0,Alice,7,
