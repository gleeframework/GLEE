"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the product for significantly less from John.  He should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $20,000 is way out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's final offer of $17,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's closer than her initial offer, Bob has a guaranteed option with John at $8,000.  There's no point in risking further negotiation with Alice when a better deal is readily available."
