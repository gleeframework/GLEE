Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find really useful. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 is a good starting point as it's closer to the product's value to Bob ($120) and leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:**  The message emphasizes the product's potential value to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message doesn't state the price as final, leaving room for Bob to counter-offer. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while remaining open to a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Accepting his offer would result in no profit.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I can likely get a better price if I counter-offer. 
* **Keeping options open:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating with him, while also maintaining the option to sell to John if the negotiations fail. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit by exploring further negotiation with Bob, while still having a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While I understand your offer, I need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile. How about $90? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  $90 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Value proposition:**  The message highlights the value of the product for Bob, reminding him of its worth.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  The message leaves the door open for further discussion, indicating that I'm flexible.

This counteroffer aims to reach a mutually agreeable price while still securing a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small profit:** While $85 is only slightly above my minimum acceptable price, it does offer a small profit. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Continuing to negotiate could lead to Bob getting frustrated and walking away, leaving me with only John's offer of $80.
* **Time factor:**  The longer the negotiation drags on, the more likely it is that I'll lose interest or find another buyer, which may not be better than this offer.

This decision balances the desire for a higher profit with the risk of losing the deal altogether.  $85 is a decent compromise, considering the value of the product to Bob and the potential for a sale to John."
