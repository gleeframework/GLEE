Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about the other offer you received. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $925,000. I can offer you the product for $975,000, which is the best price I'm willing to accept.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

It's clear Alice is very unlikely to go below $975,000.  At this point, cutting my losses and taking John's offer at $1,000,000 makes the most sense."
