"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's meet halfway.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,500 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,800? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal.",11800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,800 is still not enough. I'm willing to go down to $12,200, but that's my final offer. This is a great deal for you, and it's the closest I can come to meeting your budget. Let's close this deal now.",12200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that $12,200 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,900? I'm really interested in the product and would like to make a deal.",11900.0,Bob,6,
