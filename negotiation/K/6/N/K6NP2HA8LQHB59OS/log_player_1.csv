I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is truly interested.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest level and see if he's willing to come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I need to get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit."

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,250,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  It also keeps me above my minimum acceptable value.  Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to make a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

While Bob's offer is slightly higher, it's still far below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a bit further. John is a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, so I still have a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm going to lower my price again to $1,100,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will be enough to entice Bob to make a final, higher offer.  If he doesn't budge, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

```

Bob is clearly not going to meet my desired price.  It's getting frustrating, and I'm not sure if he's ever going to budge.  To avoid further frustration and potential losses, I'm going to sell to John.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a guaranteed sale and a safe option."
