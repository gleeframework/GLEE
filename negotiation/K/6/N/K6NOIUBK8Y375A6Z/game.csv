"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product. While $1,400,000 is a tempting offer, I can't accept anything below $1,700,000. I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its potential worth to you in the long run. What are your thoughts?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,400,000 and $1,700,000. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
