"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's better to reject and start the negotiation process."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your feedback. I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  Let's meet in the middle a bit â€“ how about $1,700,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

While $1,700,000 is closer to your budget, it's still over your comfort zone.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
