Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above your minimum acceptable price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a significant profit if he accepts outright.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John at $120.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit from Bob while having a secure backup plan with John."
