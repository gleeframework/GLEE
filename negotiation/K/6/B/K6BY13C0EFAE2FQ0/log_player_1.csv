Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 is my initial asking price, I understand your budget concerns.  Could you meet me at $17,000? It's a very fair offer for the value you'll gain."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm thinking $13,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach $15,000. Accepting his current offer would mean losing out on a guaranteed $1,500. It's more profitable to cut negotiations and sell to John."
