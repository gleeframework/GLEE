Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm asking for $1,400,000, an investment reflective of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""potential"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The phrasing ""an investment reflective of its worth"" suggests the price is somewhat flexible and open to discussion. 

This approach aims to gauge Bob's interest while keeping the door open for a deal close to your desired price. If Bob rejects this initial offer, you can always negotiate down, knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000."
