Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your understanding of the product's potential value to me. However, I'm hoping to secure it for a slightly lower price.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us.  While your valuation is fair, I'm confident this product offers significant untapped potential that justifies a higher price.  Would you consider $1,110,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,110,000 is still a bit higher than where I feel comfortable.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,080,000. I'm confident we can finalize this deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still early in the negotiation. While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we have room to push for a better price. There's no need to rush to John's offer just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and we're getting closer. However, I'm still hoping to come in a little lower. How about $1,085,000? This feels like a fair price for both of us, allowing you to achieve a good return while still allowing me to save some money.  Let's seal the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly committed to the purchase and is steadily increasing his offer.  At $1,085,000, we're getting a strong return above our minimum, and further haggling carries the risk of losing the deal altogether. It's time to secure a good profit."
