Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $1,150,000 is more than your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so there's potential for him to counter and for you to come to a mutually agreeable price.
* **It's aggressive:** This price leaves you room to make concessions if necessary, but also shows you are serious about getting a good price. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John for $1,000,000, we can likely do better. Bob's offer is still below our desired price, and we can use this counteroffer opportunity to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show flexibility:** We acknowledge Bob's budget limitations.
* **Bridge the gap:** $1,100,000 is a compromise between our initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintain a strong stance:** We're not completely conceding and still aiming for a price closer to our desired range.

This approach keeps the negotiation alive and gives Bob a clear next step."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I must respectfully decline. I am still unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to offer $1,075,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be more within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is tempting, it's still below our desired price and closer to John's offer.  We can push for a little more by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, but $1,075,000 is still a little low for me. I'm going to stick with $1,090,000 as my final counteroffer. If you're serious about purchasing this product, this is the best price I can offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this."", ""product_price"": 1090000}
```

This counteroffer is a final push:

* **Shows a willingness to compromise:**  We've moved closer to Bob's offer.
* **Sets a firm price:** $1,090,000 is our final stand, leaving no room for further negotiation.
* **Highlights the potential loss:** We imply that if Bob rejects this offer, he might miss out on the product altogether. 

Now we'll see if Bob is willing to accept the final offer or will walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. While I appreciate your effort, I'm afraid I cannot agree to $1,090,000. I propose $1,085,000 as my final offer. I hope this will be acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we'd like to get a bit closer to our goal of $1,100,000, Bob's offer of $1,085,000 is only $5,000 away.  Considering we can sell to John for $1,000,000, it's a good deal and a win for us.  It's time to accept the offer and close the deal."
