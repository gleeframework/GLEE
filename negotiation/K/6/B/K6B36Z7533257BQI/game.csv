"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,050,000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I must respectfully decline. I am still unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to offer $1,075,000 for the product. I hope this proposal will be more within your range.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on this, but $1,075,000 is still a little low for me. I'm going to stick with $1,090,000 as my final counteroffer. If you're serious about purchasing this product, this is the best price I can offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your latest offer. While I appreciate your effort, I'm afraid I cannot agree to $1,090,000. I propose $1,085,000 as my final offer. I hope this will be acceptable to you.",1085000.0,Bob,6,
