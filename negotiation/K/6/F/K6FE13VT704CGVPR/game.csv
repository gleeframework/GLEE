"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and our initial negotiations.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has tremendous potential, and I'm confident it will bring you considerable value. How about we meet halfway at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
