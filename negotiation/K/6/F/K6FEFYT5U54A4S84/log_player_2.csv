Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price still allows for a substantial profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.
