"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am only able to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. This price still allows for a substantial profit for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",900000.0,Alice,3,
