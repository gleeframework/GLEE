Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have room to start high. This leaves space for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Strategic Justification:**  Phrases like ""incredibly valuable"" and ""fair price that reflects its true worth"" are used to subtly anchor the value in Bob's mind at a higher level.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know the product's worth to Bob, he might not be fully aware of its value to him. Your offer needs to be compelling but not so high that it scares him off without negotiation.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  A higher offer has the potential for a higher reward, but also increases the risk of Bob outright rejecting the offer and forcing you to settle for John's price. 

This offer balances ambition with a degree of caution, giving you a strong starting point in the negotiation."
