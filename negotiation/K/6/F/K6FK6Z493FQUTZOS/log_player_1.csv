Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great price considering the value you'll get from it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product, making it more appealing.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not asking for my full minimum, so I have room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me confidence to walk away if negotiations become too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he has shown interest and is willing to negotiate. This suggests there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain my leverage and can explore a counteroffer that aligns more closely with my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the transaction. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:** I'm aiming for a price that's a compromise, but still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  I'm using positive language and acknowledging Bob's interest to keep the negotiation friendly and open.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my counteroffer. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm still open to further negotiation, but I'm setting a clear price floor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $10,500 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my absolute minimum of $10,000.
* **Risk of losing Bob:**  If I reject this offer, there's a good chance Bob will walk away completely, and I'll be left with John as my only option. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I'm already relatively close to a deal.
* **Potential for future deals:**  Even though I'm accepting a lower price this time, building a good relationship with Bob could lead to more profitable transactions in the future."
