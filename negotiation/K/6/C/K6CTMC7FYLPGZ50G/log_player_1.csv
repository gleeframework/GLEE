Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gain more.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth. 
* **Alternative:** By mentioning listing it ""publicly,"" I'm implying there might be other interested buyers, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** My tone is open for discussion rather than demanding.

**Important Note:** I'm assuming a one-shot offer to Bob to maximize the chances of a quick sale at a higher price.  If multiple rounds of negotiation were possible, a slightly lower initial offer might be more strategic."
