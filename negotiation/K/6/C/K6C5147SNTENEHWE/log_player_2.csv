"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. It's a steal at this price, if I do say so myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:While $100 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price from Alice by rejecting the initial offer. This might lead to her lowering the price further, getting you a better deal. If Alice doesn't significantly lower the price in her next offer, you can always go with John."
