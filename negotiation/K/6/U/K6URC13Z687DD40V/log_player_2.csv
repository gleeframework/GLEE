Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is now closer to my desired price range.  While I could continue negotiating, I risk her becoming less flexible.  Also,  with only 5 rounds remaining, the time pressure increases the risk of either losing the deal or having to buy from John at a higher price.  At this point, accepting the offer secures a good deal without jeopardizing the opportunity."
