"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it would be a significant asset to your portfolio. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You are willing to pay a maximum of $800,000, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy.  This allows you to try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm genuinely interested in the product, and I'm prepared to pay up to $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While she has come down, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still out of my range.  I'm confident that the product is valuable, but I can't justify going beyond my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, the value of this product is firmly above $900,000.  I'm willing to consider $975,000 as my final offer. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's more than reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down in price, her final offer of $975,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John.  You save $175,000 compared to Alice's offer."
