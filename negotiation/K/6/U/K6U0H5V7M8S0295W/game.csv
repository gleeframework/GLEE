"Hi Alice,  $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest!  $8,500 is a bit too low for me at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm confident you'll find this product is worth the investment.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,250 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",8500.0,Bob,4,
