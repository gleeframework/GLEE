"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

You're trying to save as much money as possible, and $10,000 is still more than you're willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest!  $8,500 is a bit too low for me at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? I'm confident you'll find this product is worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,250 is closer to your target, it's still more than you're willing to pay.  You can likely get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
