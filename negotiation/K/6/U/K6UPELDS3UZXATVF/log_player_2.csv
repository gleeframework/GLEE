"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a $30 discount, which is a significant amount but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to show Alice that I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $135, which is a good deal considering my maximum price is $150. It's not a huge saving but it's better than nothing. There's always a risk of negotiating further and Alice might not budge again, so it's better to secure a deal at this price."
