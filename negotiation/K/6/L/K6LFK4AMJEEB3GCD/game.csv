"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but based on my needs, I am only willing to pay up to $8000. Would you consider adjusting your offer to meet my budget?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $12000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to go down to $11000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I've gone as low as I can on the price, and I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10500. I think it's time for us to part ways. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $15000, which is the minimum price I'm willing to accept. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you in the middle between $10500 and $15000. I'm offering it to you for $12750. This is my final offer. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,7,
