"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175.  It's a great deal for something worth a lot more to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is more than Bob values the product, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $140?  That's still a great deal for you, and closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I believe I can potentially get a better price if I keep negotiating with Bob. There are still several rounds left, and I'm willing to risk losing a bit of time to try and reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  We've already gone through five rounds of negotiation, and I'm starting to run out of time.  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, there's no guarantee that he'll ever come up to my price. It's better to secure the guaranteed $150 from John rather than risk getting less from Bob or ending up with no deal at all."
