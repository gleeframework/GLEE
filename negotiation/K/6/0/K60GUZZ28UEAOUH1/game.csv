"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, $700,000 is considerably below its true worth and my minimum acceptable price.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,000,000.  This acknowledges the value it holds for both of us while allowing for a profitable transaction on both sides.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to a workable price, it's still a significant investment for me.  To meet somewhere in the middle, I'd be willing to offer $750,000. I'm eager to find a solution that benefits us both.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I value the negotiation process and want to find a solution that works. However, the gap between $750,000 and the value this product represents remains substantial.  To demonstrate my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. I believe this is a significant move on my part and reflects a genuine desire to strike a deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I acknowledge your willingness to compromise, and $950,000 is tempting.  However, to be transparent, my budget really only allows for a maximum of $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I understand, but I may need to explore other options.",800000.0,Bob,6,
