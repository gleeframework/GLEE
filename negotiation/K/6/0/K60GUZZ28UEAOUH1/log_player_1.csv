"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I want to anchor the negotiation closer to my minimum acceptable price. By starting at $1,100,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation while still aiming high. 
* **Leaving Room:**  I understand Bob values the product lower than I do.  This initial offer gives us space to find a mutually beneficial price.
* **Open Communication:** I want to establish a collaborative tone by emphasizing that this is a starting point for discussion. I'm open to Bob's perspective and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $700,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting it would mean a loss of $500,000. While I want to reach an agreement with Bob, I'm willing to negotiate further to close the gap. I'm confident that a price closer to both our valuations is achievable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and understand your perspective on the value. However, $700,000 is considerably below its true worth and my minimum acceptable price.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,000,000.  This acknowledges the value it holds for both of us while allowing for a profitable transaction on both sides."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I start by showing respect for Bob's offer and understanding of his valuation. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  While I'm coming down in price, I'm making it clear that $700,000 is not acceptable. The $1,000,000 counteroffer represents a significant concession on my part but keeps the negotiation within a reasonable range.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:** I want to emphasize that finding a price that works for both of us is important. By framing it this way, I hope to encourage Bob to make a more agreeable counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,000,000 is closer to a workable price, it's still a significant investment for me.  To meet somewhere in the middle, I'd be willing to offer $750,000. I'm eager to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is incrementally better, but $750,000 is still too far from my $1,200,000 minimum.  I'm sensing a pattern of smaller concessions from Bob.  By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about a price closer to my valuation and am willing to walk away if necessary.  The potential loss from accepting this offer is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I value the negotiation process and want to find a solution that works. However, the gap between $750,000 and the value this product represents remains substantial.  To demonstrate my commitment to getting this done, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. I believe this is a significant move on my part and reflects a genuine desire to strike a deal."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Appreciation and Patience:** I want to continue reinforcing a positive and respectful tone. Bob is engaging, and it's important to acknowledge his efforts.
* **Significant Concession, Strategic Position:**  Dropping to $950,000 is a substantial concession, signaling my willingness to be flexible. This price point also puts me in a stronger position.  It's unlikely Bob will counter below $800,000 (his valuation), and I'm still open to negotiating within that $150,000 range.
* **Call to Action:**  I'm clearly stating this is a serious offer and urging Bob to recognize the progress we're making.  This creates a sense of momentum toward a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I acknowledge your willingness to compromise, and $950,000 is tempting.  However, to be transparent, my budget really only allows for a maximum of $800,000. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.  If not, I understand, but I may need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Revealed His Maximum:** Bob has essentially signaled that $800,000 is his absolute ceiling. It's unlikely he'll budge further.
* **Minimizing Risk:** Continuing to negotiate could push Bob away, leading to a lost sale. Accepting $800,000 secures a significant profit, even if it's less than initially hoped for.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means I have the capital sooner, allowing for potential reinvestment or other opportunities.  The difference between $800,000 and a potentially higher price after more rounds of negotiation is outweighed by these factors."
