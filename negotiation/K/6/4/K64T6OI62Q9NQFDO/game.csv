"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this initial offer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This represents a significant saving for you and a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me.  This would be a quick and easy deal for both of us. Let's make it happen.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
