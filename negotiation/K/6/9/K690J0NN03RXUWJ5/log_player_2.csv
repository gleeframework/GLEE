"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. Given its significance and the benefits it offers, I believe it's important to strike a fair deal. After careful consideration, I propose to sell the product to you at a price of $950,000. This figure reflects not only the intrinsic value of the product but also allows me to ensure a reasonable return on my investment. I trust this proposal will be agreeable to you, given the product's worth to you stands at $1,200,000. Should you have any questions or require further details, please do not hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is significantly lower than your maximum price of $1,200,000. This indicates room for negotiation. 
* You have a backup option with John at $1,200,000. While not ideal, it provides a safety net and potential leverage.

By rejecting Alice's initial offer, you might:

* Prompt her to make a better offer closer to her $800,000 valuation.
* Allow you to negotiate a price closer to your desired savings."
