"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price closer to your ideal. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This first offer helps gauge Bob's level of interest and provides insight into his valuation of the product. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $800,000. This knowledge gives you leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is tempting, we're aiming for the highest possible profit. We started high for a reason, and there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we believe the product is worth more, potentially pushing Bob closer to our desired price point. We'll use the next round to propose a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I understand your budget constraints, the value this product brings is undeniable. Let's meet in the middle - how about $975,000?"", 
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach often feels fair to both parties, potentially making Bob more receptive. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  By lowering our price by $25,000, we demonstrate willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a strong position. 
* **Above Reserve:** Importantly, our counteroffer remains significantly above our ""walk-away"" price of $800,000 (John's offer), giving us room to maneuver in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $950,000. I hope this offers a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  Bob's offer of $950,000 represents a substantial profit above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away increases with each round. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now allows us to utilize the funds sooner, potentially reinvesting or putting them to work elsewhere. 

While we could push for a higher price, the current offer represents a solid win in this scenario."
