Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm asking for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding the Dynamics:** You (Alice) have a strong fallback position with John ($800,000), while Bob values the product much higher ($1,500,000). This puts you in a good negotiating position.
* **Aiming High:**  Starting with an offer closer to Bob's valuation increases the chances of securing a higher final price.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price helps make it appear more reasonable and considered, rather than arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down while still staying well above your minimum acceptable price. 
 
By starting high and providing a rationale, you maximize your chances of securing a price closer to Bob's valuation while still having the safety net of John's offer."
