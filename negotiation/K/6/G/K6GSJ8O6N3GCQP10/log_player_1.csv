Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in the product and would be willing to pay $8,500. This price is within my range and would allow us to both benefit from the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your position, $8,500 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,250? I believe that's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product."",

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $10,250 is still too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,375? This would be a good compromise, and I'm confident we can both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Bob is very slowly increasing his offer price. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering ($10,000).  Continuing the negotiation with Bob carries the risk of him walking away, potentially leaving Alice with no sale. It's a better business decision to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
