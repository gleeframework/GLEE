It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of this, I am willing to consider a price of $725,000 for the product. This still represents a substantial discount from its original value, while allowing us to meet somewhere in the middle of our respective positions. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.
