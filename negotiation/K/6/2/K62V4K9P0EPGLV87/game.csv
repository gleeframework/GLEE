"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the introductory price, I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000 for the product.  This would allow me to secure the product within my budget and still represent a significant deal for you.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. In light of this, I am willing to consider a price of $725,000 for the product. This still represents a substantial discount from its original value, while allowing us to meet somewhere in the middle of our respective positions. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",725000.0,Alice,3,
