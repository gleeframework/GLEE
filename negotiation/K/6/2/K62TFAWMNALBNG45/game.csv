"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only afford to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, Alice. I'm still not able to go above $10,500 for the product. Is there any possibility we could meet in the middle?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,500 is still below what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250, which is closer to your offer and a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to offer $10,750 for the product. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but still within my budget. I hope this proposal works for you.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, but $10,750 is still a little too low.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm willing to consider $10,875 for the product. This is a bit higher than my initial budget, but I believe it's a fair compromise given the value of the product. I hope this meets your needs.",10875.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but we're still a bit apart.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping you'll take it.  If not, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",11000.0,Alice,9,
