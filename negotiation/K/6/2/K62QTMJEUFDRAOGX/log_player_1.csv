Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to Bob, which might make him more willing to negotiate.
* **Open to discussion:** I'm keeping the door open for further negotiation, which is important if Bob isn't satisfied with the initial offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a great deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While $850,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob is interested, and I believe there's room for a higher price. He's willing to pay more than John, so it's worth continuing the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my ideal outcome.  I'll need to be careful not to push too hard and risk losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $900,000?  That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value, and it's closer to what I need to make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise and keeps the negotiation moving.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob, hoping to sway him towards accepting a higher price.
* **Emphasizing the deal:** I'm framing the offer as a ""good deal"" for Bob, appealing to his sense of value.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll analyze Bob's response carefully. If he accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $825,000 is a more reasonable price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is above my minimum:** $825,000 is slightly above my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk he'll walk away, and I'll be left with John's offer of $800,000.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time, and it's not guaranteed that I'll get a significantly higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer, secure the sale, and move on. It's a good outcome, even if it's not my ideal price."
