"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right buyer.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $11,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's quality and potential value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** While $9,500 is above my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. Bob's interest shows he's willing to negotiate.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price range.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:** Selling to John for $8,000 would be the least profitable option, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down to $10,000 for the product.  That's still a great deal for you, considering its value. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price from $11,000 to $10,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's worth and highlighting the deal's value for Bob.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** $9,000 is quite close to my desired price range and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only 6 rounds remaining, I need to be strategic.  There's a good chance that further negotiations might not yield a significantly higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to get closer to $10,000, the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and potentially ending the negotiation is high. Accepting his offer ensures a profitable sale."
