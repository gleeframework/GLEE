Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to consider the product. This can help build rapport and encourage him to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open Ended:** The message ends with an open-ended question, giving Bob space to respond and start the negotiation. 

This approach balances maximizing my potential profit with being open to negotiation, aiming to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable value, I'm not in a hurry to sell.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Explore Higher Prices:** I can see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $100. 
* **Test Bob's Interest:** Rejecting his offer shows I'm not desperate and might increase Bob's willingness to pay more. 

By proceeding to the next round, I maintain control and potentially increase my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $90. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price from $100 to $90. 
* **Reasoning:**  I provide a reason for my price, highlighting the value of the product, to justify my counteroffer.
* **Open Ended:**  Again, I end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond.

This approach aims to find a middle ground while still maintaining a profitable price for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Time Factor:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might change his mind or I could get stuck in a prolonged back-and-forth.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at a price that's almost as good as my initial goal. 

This decision balances maximizing profit with minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
