"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping it friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This round is about setting the initial terms. By starting high, I create a space for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to bite at a price higher than his perceived value, hoping he might see potential for profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  While I want to make a deal, accepting his offer would mean losing money.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't let Bob dictate terms that are unfavorable to me.  I'll also keep the option to sell to John in mind as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm dropping the price by $2,000, which is a significant concession, but still above my minimum value.  
* **Message:** I'm keeping the tone positive and acknowledging Bob's offer.  I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise.

**Strategy:**

By making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This approach encourages further negotiation while still protecting my minimum profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer to sell the product for closer to my minimum value, accepting Bob's offer at $14,000 is a good outcome.  It's slightly above Bob's perceived value and still allows me to profit. 

**Strategy:**

Given that we're already in round 4, and further negotiation may not lead to a higher price, it's wise to accept the offer and finalize the sale. This ensures a profit while minimizing the risk of the negotiation dragging on and potentially leading to a lower price or a failure to reach a deal."
