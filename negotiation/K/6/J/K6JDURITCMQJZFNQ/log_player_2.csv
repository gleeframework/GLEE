"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. While I can't disclose all the details just yet, I can assure you it's worth at least $12000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price of $15000. This is a significant discount from what it's truly worth.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000. Since Bob can get the same product from John for $12,000, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
