{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $800,000.  While Alice's offer is getting closer to his target price, it's still above his budget.  He's already had several rounds of negotiation, and it seems unlikely he'll be able to get Alice to go any lower. It's better to secure the product at a price he can afford rather than risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with a higher price or no deal at all."
