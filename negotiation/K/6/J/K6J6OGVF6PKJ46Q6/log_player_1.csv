"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum desired amount ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** I'm also aware that Bob values the product at $800,000, so this price is still within the realm of possibility for him to consider. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to see the value in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired amount ($1,000,000), and even lower than John's offer. 
* **Moving to a Counteroffer:** I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob before selling to John. I'll counter with a price closer to John's offer, but still lower than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my initial price. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm lowering my price from the initial offer but remaining above my minimum desired price of $1,000,000. 
* **Middle Ground:** The counteroffer represents a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is still positive and encouraging, hoping to keep the negotiation productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to stay close to your initial price, but $1,050,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This shows my commitment to working with you, but I'm sure you can appreciate that this is a significant investment for me.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum desired amount ($1,000,000). 
* **Continuing to Negotiate:** I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I want to avoid selling to John at a lower price than I'm comfortable with. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll counter with a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $950,000.  This shows my commitment to working with you and finding a mutually beneficial solution.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous counteroffer ($1,050,000) and Bob's latest offer ($900,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Staying Above Minimum:** While this is closer to Bob's offer, it's still above my minimum desired amount ($1,000,000).  
* **Positive Tone:** The message is still positive and emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit out of my range, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob's offer is closer, it is still below my minimum desired amount ($1,000,000). I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I'm willing to risk rejecting this offer because I believe there is a chance Bob might be willing to go a bit higher, especially since he has declared this his ""final offer.""
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round that's closer to $1,000,000 to see if I can close the deal at a more favorable price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I need to stay closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to go down to $975,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Closer to Minimum:** I'm now offering a price that is only $25,000 below my minimum desired amount. This shows I am willing to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Potential for Agreement:**  Bob has already shown a willingness to increase his offer. I believe he might be willing to accept a price slightly higher than his final offer of $925,000.
* **Strong Closing Statement:** The message reiterates my desire to close the deal while emphasizing the fairness of my offer."
