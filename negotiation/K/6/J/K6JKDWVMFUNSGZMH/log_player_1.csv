Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. While I understand your position, I'm still unable to go above $8,000 for the product. Would it be possible to meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is firm at $8,000.  Since this matches John's offer, it's best to accept and avoid potentially losing both buyers."
