Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! However, I still think $7,500 is a bit low. How about we meet at $8,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

It's clear Alice won't go below $8,000.  Since John will sell it for that price, there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
