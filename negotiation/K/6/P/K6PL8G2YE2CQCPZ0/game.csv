"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $200 is my initial asking price, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to do $100? That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  How about we split the difference and settle at $130?",130.0,Alice,5,
