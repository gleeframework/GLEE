"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, Bob. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $150. It's better to reject her offer and go with John, who you know will sell the product for your maximum price."
