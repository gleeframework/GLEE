"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,350,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
