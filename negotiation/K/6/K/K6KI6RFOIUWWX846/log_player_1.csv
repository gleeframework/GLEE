Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking $175 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm using a friendly and open tone, indicating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasoning:**  This strategy aims to:
    * Gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffer.
    * Leave room for some bargaining without risking a deal below my minimum. 
    * If Bob rejects, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $150. Accepting it would be a loss for me.  While I want to sell the product, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price.  Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer allows me to try and reach a mutually agreeable price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $140? That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value but still allows for some negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm remaining polite and showing a willingness to compromise while still stating my position clearly.  
* **Reasoning:** This counteroffer:
    * Keeps the negotiation moving forward.
    * Signals that I'm flexible but not desperate. 
    * Allows for potential agreement while still earning a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $135. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $135 is still below my ideal price, it is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $150.  The negotiation has reached a point where further counteroffers might risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and prevents me from potentially getting nothing if I keep rejecting and end up selling to John for the same price.  It's a calculated risk to maximize my profit in this situation."
