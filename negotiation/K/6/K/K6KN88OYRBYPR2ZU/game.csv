"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its market value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my spending within a lower budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Would it be possible for us to agree on a price of $8,200? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a good deal.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $8,200 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,400? It's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.",8400.0,Alice,5,
