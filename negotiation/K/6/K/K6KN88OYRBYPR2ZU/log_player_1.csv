Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I am looking to keep my spending within a lower budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer.  While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not going to give it away for that price. I can always sell to John, so I have leverage. I'll try to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $8,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Would it be possible for us to agree on a price of $8,200? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I will reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still have the option to sell to John for $8,000.  I'm hoping to get closer to $9,000, so I'll keep negotiating with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $8,200 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,400? It's a good price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 8400}
