"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,000,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think that's a fair compromise considering my budget and the market value.",950000.0,Bob,4,
