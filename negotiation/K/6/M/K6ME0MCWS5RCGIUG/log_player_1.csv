Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $900,000 is a respectable figure, I believe the true value of this product is significantly higher.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,000,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $950,000. I think that's a fair compromise considering my budget and the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
