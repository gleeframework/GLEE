"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $170 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $170 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $155. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a little too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $145 for the product. If you're not able to come down to that, I might have to go with another seller. ",145.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to be flexible, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to meet you at $152.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",152.5,Alice,5,
