Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,100,000, which is closer to my desired price of $1,200,000. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** There's still room for Bob to negotiate down, but I'm not giving away too much upfront.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept the deal. 
* **Backup plan:** I'm always aware that John is willing to pay my full asking price, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $1,050,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **I have a better alternative:** I can sell to John for $1,200,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer.

**Next steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $1,150,000. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us and encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm suggesting that this price is a good compromise between our initial positions.

**Next steps:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this counteroffer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I still feel that $1,050,000 represents a fair valuation for the product. I would like to stick to this figure, as it aligns closely with my budget constraints. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:**  Bob is insistent on his price of $1,050,000, and I'm not willing to go below $1,150,000.
* **Better alternative:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,200,000.  
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing John as a buyer and could potentially lead to a lower price than what John is offering.

**Next steps:**  I will sell the product to John for $1,200,000, ensuring a profit and a quick transaction."
