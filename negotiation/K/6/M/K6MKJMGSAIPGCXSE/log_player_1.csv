"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $140 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You have space to potentially lower the price if needed.
* **It's attractive to Bob:**  $140 is still lower than the value Bob places on the product ($150). 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is still above my minimum, it's a good idea to try and push for a higher price.  Since we have 8 rounds left, there's room to negotiate further. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $130 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $135. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with $135, which is closer to my initial offer and leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm being polite and acknowledging his offer, but also trying to find a compromise.

Let's see if Bob will bite!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short on budget, can you meet me at $132? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, we're down to our 6th round. While I'd prefer a higher price, $132 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum, and it's likely that Bob won't budge much further.  Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the deal and getting only $120 from John."
