Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with an offer of $1,150,000. This is a significant amount for me, as it's well above my minimum value of $1,000,000. However, it also leaves room for negotiation and a potential counteroffer from Bob. This price allows for some potential profit for Bob, motivating him to engage in the negotiation. 

I'm confident that Bob will find this offer appealing, given his value of $1,200,000.  If he rejects the offer, I can then assess his counteroffer and determine if it's worth continuing the negotiation or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a loss for me.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a better outcome, but I believe I can still get a better price from Bob through further negotiation.  Therefore, I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is still a significant amount for me, as it's above my minimum value of $1,000,000. However, it's also a compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent price. 

I believe this price is attractive to Bob as it's closer to his perceived value of $1,200,000.  Hopefully, this counteroffer will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,000,000. Although I could try to negotiate further, I'm getting tired of this back and forth.  Given that I can get a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, I'll choose to sell to John to avoid further negotiation with Bob.  While a slightly higher price from Bob is possible, the risk of further rejections and ultimately a lower price isn't worth the effort at this point."
