"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm going to counter with $13,750 for the product. What are your thoughts?",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,750 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a fair compromise. This price would allow us both to walk away with a reasonable deal. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about the value of this product and what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to counter with $13,500, which is still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What are your thoughts?",13500.0,Alice,5,
