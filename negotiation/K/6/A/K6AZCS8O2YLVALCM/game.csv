"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find very valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is interesting, but $2,250,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000, which is a significant amount and reflects the value I see in this product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,250,000 represents its true value, I understand your perspective.  I could consider coming down to $2,000,000. This offer signifies a considerable investment from my end, but I believe in fostering a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $2,000,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm prepared to pay $1,800,000, which represents a substantial investment on my part. I believe this offer is fair and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down slightly more to $1,900,000. This is a firm offer on my end, as I believe it accurately reflects the product's value and the potential return on your investment.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I understand you're firm on $1,900,000. While I value the product, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $1,850,000.  This is my final offer. If it's not acceptable, I'll need to consider other options.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
