"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's offer of $150 is far above your $80 limit and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to buy from John for the best price."
