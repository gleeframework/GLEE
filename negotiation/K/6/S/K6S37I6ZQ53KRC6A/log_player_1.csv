Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Can you meet me halfway?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  $100 is my absolute minimum, but I'm hoping to get closer to my original asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to sell it for $125.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice! However, $115 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, I've already made several counteroffers and I'm worried about running out of time.  Selling to Bob for $105 is still a good deal for me, and it's better than selling to John for $100."
