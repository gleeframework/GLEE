Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $15,000. Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing on a price higher than your minimum. 
* **Highlight Value:** Emphasizing the product's value and Bob's exclusive opportunity creates a sense of urgency and desirability. 

This strategy balances ambition with the safety net of John's offer."
