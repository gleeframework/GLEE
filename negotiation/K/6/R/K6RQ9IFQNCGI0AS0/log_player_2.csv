"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  You'd pay $900,000 for the product from Alice, which is less than the $1,200,000 you'd pay to John.
* **It's within your budget:** The price is still within your $1,200,000 limit."
