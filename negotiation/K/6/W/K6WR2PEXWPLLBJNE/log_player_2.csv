```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, it's still too high. I will continue to negotiate. With only 3 rounds remaining, I'm aiming to secure a deal that is as close to my $80 limit as possible.  I believe a few more rounds of negotiation will get me there."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 78}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer one more time to $78.  This is getting very close to my maximum budget, but I'm hoping to secure a deal before I have to resort to buying from John.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget, and we're down to our last round.  It's unlikely that we'll be able to reach an agreement within the remaining time, and I don't want to risk losing out on the product altogether. Buying from John for $80 is the most sensible choice at this point, ensuring I get the product while staying within my budget."
