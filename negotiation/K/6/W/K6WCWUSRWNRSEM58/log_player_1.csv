{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $120. This is above my minimum of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm being friendly and highlighting the value for Bob. 
* **Strategy:** This strategy aims to get a good price without being too aggressive. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm starting strong to see if Bob is willing to pay close to my ideal price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you trying to work with me, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'm confident I can get closer to my goal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $100 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $110?  I'm confident this is a fair price that's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
