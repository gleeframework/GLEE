"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  It wouldn't cover my costs.  However, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,050,000?  This is a fair price that still allows us both to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer $975,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I'm still very interested in purchasing the product from you.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but only to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I'm confident this is a deal we can both agree on.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
