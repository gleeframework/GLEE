Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $99. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $99 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate (though unlikely given his valuation of $80).
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start at $100, it might make Bob less likely to engage in any negotiation at all. 

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob while still ensuring you don't miss out on the guaranteed sale to John."
