"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price given the value I place on the product and your willingness to negotiate.",875000.0,Bob,4,
