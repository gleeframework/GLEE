"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $115 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $105 for it. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. That's still a good price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
