"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000. This is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, giving me room to negotiate. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and get a sense of his potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer is too low to be considered.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'm going to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price from $1,800,000 to $1,500,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but still leaves room for further bargaining. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob while still securing a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to counteroffer again with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm lowering my price again, this time to $1,400,000. This shows continued flexibility and is a reasonable compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough to Bob to lead to a deal. If he rejects, I'll have to consider the risk of selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is very close to my previous counteroffer and only $50,000 less than my desired price of $1,400,000.  Given the limited rounds remaining, I believe it's worth accepting this offer.  The potential risk of further negotiation with Bob and potentially being forced to sell to John for $1,200,000 is not worth the extra $50,000."
