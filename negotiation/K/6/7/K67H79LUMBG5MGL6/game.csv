"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $75? ",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle at $82.50? It's still a great deal for both of us.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $82.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about $80?  That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
