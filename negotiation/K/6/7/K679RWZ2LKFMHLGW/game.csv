"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,400,000. This price still allows for a good profit for me, while also being within a reasonable range for you.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
