{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. I think it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value, hoping to get close to the middle ground. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, I'm still above my minimum value and believe I can do better.  I'll try a counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum value of $100. While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement. Selling to John for $100 guarantees me my minimum value, and it's the best course of action at this point."
