"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I've already gone as low as I can. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'll offer it to you for $125, but this is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",125.0,Alice,7,
