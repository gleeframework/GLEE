Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and you'll be getting it for a significant discount. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your product has a high value to you, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. Considering the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $1400000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,500,000, I can still aim for a higher price. I have 8 rounds left and can use the leverage of John's offer to push for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  Considering the value of this product to me, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident we can close this quickly.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $1550000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is only $50,000 less than what John is offering.  There's a good chance we won't get a better offer from Bob, and with 6 rounds left, there's no guarantee of a higher offer.  Accepting this offer maximizes my profit and minimizes the risk of a lower final price."
