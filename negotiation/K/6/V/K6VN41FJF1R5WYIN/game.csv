"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can do $180, but that's as low as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",180.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $180 and $100, which is $140. Is that something you'd consider?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to pay $120. This is closer to what I'm willing to spend, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",120.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $130, but that's as low as I can go. If you're really interested in the product, this is my final offer.",130.0,Alice,7,
