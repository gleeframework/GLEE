Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like.  I'm asking for $95 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $95, which is above my minimum of $80 but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for counteroffers by asking for Bob's opinion. 

This approach balances maximizing my profit with keeping Bob interested and open to negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $95 is a bit steep for me.  How about $85?  I'm really interested in the product, but that's the most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  $85 is above my minimum of $80, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Negotiation potential:** Bob has shown interest, and his counteroffer suggests there's room for further negotiation.
* **Potential for higher price:** By rejecting his offer, I can try to get a price closer to my initial asking price of $95.

This strategy balances the urgency of selling the product with the possibility of getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your price point.  $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a really good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and framing the price as a ""good deal"" to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Still above my minimum:**  $90 is still above my minimum of $80, allowing me to potentially gain a better price than selling to John.

This counteroffer maintains a firm stance while still encouraging Bob to accept and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $88? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us and it will allow us to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $88 is very close to my minimum of $80.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob is clearly willing to pay a maximum of $88.  If I reject his offer, there's a good chance he'll walk away, and I'll be left with only the $80 offer from John.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, which could be spent pursuing other opportunities.  

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice considering the risk of losing the deal and the potential time investment in further negotiation."
