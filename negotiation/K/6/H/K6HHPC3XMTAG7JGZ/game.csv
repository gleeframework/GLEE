"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $110 for it. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a stretch, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $130. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $115?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $130 was a bit too high, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $125. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,5,
