Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $120."",
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  By starting at $120, we can see how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. His response will give us valuable information for our next move. 
* **Alternative Option:** We always have John as a backup buyer at $80, so there's limited risk in starting with a higher offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to sell it for $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $70 is below our minimum acceptable price of $80.  While we want to maximize our profit, accepting a loss isn't a good strategy. We should counter-offer in hopes of reaching a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $70 is quite a bit below my bottom line. Could you do $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** We're coming down from our initial offer ($120) significantly, showing Bob we're willing to negotiate.  This new offer is closer to the middle ground between our initial price and his offer. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** The $100 offer keeps us above our $80 minimum, ensuring we make a profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counter-offer will help us gauge Bob's flexibility. If he's unwilling to budge much from $70, we might be better off selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high. Would you be willing to sell it for $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $85 is above our minimum acceptable price of $80. While we could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Bob would go higher. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away."
