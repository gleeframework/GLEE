You have three options:

```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While you'd pay more to Alice ($1,400,000) than your ideal price, it's still less than what John is asking ($1,500,000). 
* **Your goal is to save money:**  Accepting Alice's offer allows you to acquire the product while minimizing your cost."
