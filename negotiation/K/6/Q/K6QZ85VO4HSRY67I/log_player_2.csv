"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can get the product for $15,000 from John.  Therefore, Bob should reject Alice's offer of $12,000 and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's still room for Bob to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible while staying within his budget. Offering $10,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This price is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation, and  it's significantly lower than John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has raised her price from $12,000 to $12,500, making the offer less appealing.  Bob is still better off trying to negotiate a lower price.  While John's price of $15,000 is still a safety net,  Bob can potentially get a better deal if he keeps negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than Alice's previous offer, and $11,000 is a reasonable counteroffer. It's higher than Bob's last offer, but still below Alice's current offer.  This shows that Bob is willing to negotiate but also wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is slowly increasing her price, and while it's still below John's price, the negotiation seems to be going nowhere.  At this point,  the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice is too high.  Bob is better off purchasing the product from John for $15,000.  This ensures he gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of Alice increasing her price further."
