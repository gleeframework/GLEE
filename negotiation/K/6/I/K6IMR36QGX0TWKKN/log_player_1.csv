"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than what Bob values the product at, hoping to get as close to my minimum value ($150) as possible.
* **Reasoning with Bob:**  I'm providing a reason for my price and highlighting the potential value Bob will receive.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm starting with a price that allows for a few rounds of negotiation without reaching my minimum acceptable price.

**Note:** This is just the first round, and I will adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response. I'm prepared to counteroffer if necessary, and I have the option to sell to John if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $120 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.  I can still potentially get a better price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $150 would be a good outcome, but I still have room to potentially get closer to my target price through negotiation. 

**Next Round:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, attempting to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a good value for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $130, he's getting a good deal.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Open:**  This counteroffer allows for further negotiation while still remaining above my minimum acceptable price.

**Note:** I'm carefully monitoring the situation and considering my options. If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I might need to re-evaluate my strategy, possibly considering selling to John if the negotiation becomes too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Could you consider $125 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price of $150. 
* **Room for improvement:** I'm willing to negotiate further, and there's still a chance I can secure a better deal. 
* **Avoiding a potential loss:** Selling to John would guarantee me my desired price, but I believe I can still get closer to that with a few more rounds of negotiation.

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer Bob again, trying to meet halfway between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you. While $125 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $127.50? It's a fair compromise and will allow us both to get what we want."", ""product_price"": 127.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's the midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm not willing to accept a price that's significantly below my desired minimum.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing this as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see it as a win-win situation.
* **Maintaining pressure:** By offering a price that's still above my minimum, I'm putting pressure on Bob to close the deal before I reconsider selling to John.

**Note:**  This counteroffer is a risky move.  If Bob rejects it, I might be forced to sell to John to avoid losing money. However, I'm hoping this offer is enticing enough to make Bob accept and finalize the deal."
