"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to seize this chance. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is less than John's, there's room for negotiation. You know the product is worth significantly less to Alice, and you have a backup option with John. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get Alice to lower her price closer to her own valuation."
