"Thanks for the offer Alice, while I agree the product is great, $9,500 is a little high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,800. What do you think?",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm not comfortable going any lower. I'm willing to offer it to you for $8,200. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me at this price.",8200.0,Alice,5,
