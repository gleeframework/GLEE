This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It also acknowledges the value to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I will counteroffer to try and secure a more profitable deal."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about $13,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the product's value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $13,750 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price. While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, I'm confident I can secure the sale with John for $12,000 if this deal falls through.  I'll accept Bob's offer and avoid the risk of losing both deals."
