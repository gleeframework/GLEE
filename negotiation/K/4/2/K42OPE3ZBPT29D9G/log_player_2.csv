"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $1,150,000. This is a special offer considering the high demand and limited availability of the product. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,150,000 is a good starting point, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate.

I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're making progress, Bob. Considering your latest offer, I would like to propose a price of $1,090,000 for the product.
