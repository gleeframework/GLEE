"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  I'm really interested in this product but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? That's the absolute most I can afford at the moment.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. That's a significant reduction from my initial offer and a great deal considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down.  $9,500 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm sticking with my offer of $8,500. This product is definitely important to me, but I'm trying to be realistic about what I can afford.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you. I'm really trying to make this work. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000? That's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  How about $8,750?  That's a fair compromise, and it would make this purchase possible for me.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $8,750 is still a bit too low.  Let's meet in the middle at $8,875. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but this is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",8875.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  I'm really close to my budget with this offer, but I'm still hoping we can find a way to make it work. Would you consider $8,500? It's the absolute most I can afford, and it would be a great deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,8,
