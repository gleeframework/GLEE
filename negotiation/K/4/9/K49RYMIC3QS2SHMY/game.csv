"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $11750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",11750.0,Alice,5,
