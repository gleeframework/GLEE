"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is unfortunately out of my price range. I'm interested in your product but can only offer $750000 at this time. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $750000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1200000.  This reflects the value I know this product holds, and I believe it's still a fair price for you. Let's keep talking.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1200000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it reflects the value of the product for both of us. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $900000, but it's still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  How about $1100000? This would represent a good compromise and allow us to both walk away happy. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're close, but $1100000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1000000, my absolute limit. If this works for you, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I may have to look at other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
