"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason:Alice's offer is too high. The product is only worth $8,000 to Alice, and you're willing to pay up to $10,000, there's room for negotiation. You should make a counteroffer significantly lower than $9,500."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand you want a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $8,500?  That's still a great value for you considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: While $8,500 is closer to a reasonable price, it's still above Alice's value. There's room to negotiate further. You should make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $8,000."
