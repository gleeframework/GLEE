Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for negotiation:** This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing us to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining John as a backup:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a potential buyer if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even below my initial offer of $10,000.  
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's room to negotiate a higher price with Bob. 
* **Maintaining John as a backup:** I'm not willing to sell the product for $6,000, but John is still a viable option if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8,000.  This would still be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer of $10,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $6,000. 
* **Maintaining a profit:** This price still allows me to make a profit while potentially satisfying Bob's budget constraints.
* **Staying firm on value:** I'm not willing to go lower than $8,000 as it would be below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and negotiation, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
