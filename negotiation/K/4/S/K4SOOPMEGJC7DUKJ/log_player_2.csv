"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our flagship product, which I believe would significantly enhance your operations and efficiency. Given its value to you, I understand it's worth $12,000 to you. Considering its worth to both us and you, I propose a special introductory offer of $10,000 for this product. This is an exceptional opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, she clearly states she believes the product is worth $12,000 to you. This suggests there might be room for negotiation. Rejecting her initial offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to her $8,000 value. Even if she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John for $12,000."
