Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely mentions ""value"" and ""potential"" to subtly justify the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Gauge Interest:**  This initial offer primarily serves to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. His response will dictate your next move."
