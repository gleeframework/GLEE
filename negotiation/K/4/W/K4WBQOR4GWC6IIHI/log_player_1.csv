{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price for such a valuable product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $9,500. While $8,750 is a tempting offer, I'll reject it and see if we can find a compromise in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference. How about $8,875? This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8875}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I've been going back and forth with Bob, and while I'd like to get closer to my target price, we're getting near the end of the negotiation rounds.  At this point, $8,750 is a decent price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
