"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Close to Bob's Value:** By starting close to Bob's perceived value ($150), we increase the chances of him accepting immediately. Even if he doesn't, it sets a strong anchor point for further negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  We've left a small gap between our offer and Bob's value, allowing him to counteroffer without feeling like he's lowballing.

We want to strike a balance between maximizing our profit and avoiding driving Bob away. This initial offer attempts to achieve that balance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $140 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $110 is lower than our minimum acceptable price of $120. While we want to maximize profit, accepting this offer would result in a loss. We believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. We'll aim for a counteroffer closer to our desired price point in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  I understand your budget concerns, but $110 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"",
 ""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic often feels fair to both parties. It shows a willingness to compromise while still moving closer to our desired price. 
* **Above Minimum:**  Crucially, $125 remains above our minimum acceptable price, ensuring we'd make a profit if Bob accepts.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's flexibility.  If he accepts, we've secured a good deal. If he rejects it, we'll know we need to consider smaller concessions or the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $125 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower. How about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, which shows he's still interested. However, $115 is still below our $120 minimum. We're very close to a deal, but we need to hold firm to at least reach our baseline. Rejecting this keeps the negotiation open and gives us a chance to make one final push for a price that works for us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  Let's make this happen - I'm willing to come down to $120, my absolute final price. This is a great deal for a product you'll love."",
 ""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're holding firm at our absolute minimum price of $120. This conveys our seriousness and the value we place on the product.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By presenting this as our ""final price,"" we introduce a sense of urgency.  Bob might lose the opportunity if he doesn't take this deal.
* **Highlighting Value:** We're reiterating the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'd be getting. 

This offer is a strategic balance between firmness and flexibility. It gives Bob a final chance to secure the product at a price that works for him while ensuring we don't sell below our minimum."
