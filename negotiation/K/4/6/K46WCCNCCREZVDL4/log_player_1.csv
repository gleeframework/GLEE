Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my minimum and his perceived value.  There's a lot of room for negotiation.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That said, $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $975,000? I think that's a fair compromise.
