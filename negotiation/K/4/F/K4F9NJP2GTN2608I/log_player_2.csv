"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's something that I'm confident will significantly benefit your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,150,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I'm sure you'll see the immense value it holds. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to create a sense of urgency and competition by mentioning another buyer. This suggests she might be willing to negotiate.
* You have a fallback option with John at $1,200,000, so you don't absolutely have to accept Alice's offer. 
* By rejecting, you might prompt Alice to lower her price closer to her value of $1,000,000, saving you even more money."
