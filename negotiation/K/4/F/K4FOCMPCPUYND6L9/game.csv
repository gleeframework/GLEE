"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this incredible product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for this product.  This is my final offer, as I'm also considering another option for a similar product. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're considering other options, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll meet you at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,
