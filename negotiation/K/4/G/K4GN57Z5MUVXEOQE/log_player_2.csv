You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $800,000 to her, but she's offering it to me for $950,000, which is still $150,000 more than what it's worth to her. I can get the same product from John for $1,200,000, which is a better deal for me.
