"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. I think it's a fair price for this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500. If you're not willing to go that low, I might have to consider other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,
