"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get at least $10,000 for this product. Let's meet in the middle and I'll take $10,500.  This would be a great deal for both of us. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $10,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $10,400.  This price is fair, considering the value you place on the product and my need to cover my costs. Let's finalize this deal.",10400.0,Alice,5,
