Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Since she has a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, there's no incentive to go lower.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer.  Alice can then slightly reduce the price, potentially settling on a price higher than $12,000.
* **Creating Urgency:**  By mentioning she'll list it publicly, Alice subtly creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
