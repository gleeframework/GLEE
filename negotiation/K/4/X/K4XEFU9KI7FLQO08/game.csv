"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get a fair price for it.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit more?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $7,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",8500.0,Alice,5,
