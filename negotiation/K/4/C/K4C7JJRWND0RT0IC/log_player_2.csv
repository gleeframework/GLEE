"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than what John is offering.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a little high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counteroffer starts significantly lower than Alice's opening, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also establishes that I'm serious about buying, but not at any price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,200. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but she's still above John's price. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can get her closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $8,200 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $7,500?"",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

I'm nudging my offer up slightly to show willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming to stay closer to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so let me know if it's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my bottom line, and it's the same price as John's offer. There's no benefit to negotiating further or going with John at this point."
