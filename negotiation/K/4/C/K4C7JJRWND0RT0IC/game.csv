"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a little high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,200. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $8,200 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, so let me know if it's something you'd be interested in.",8000.0,Alice,5,
