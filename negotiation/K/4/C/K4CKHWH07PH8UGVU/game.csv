"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! It's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've highlighted, $950000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $850000 for this product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $900000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $875000?  I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while also reflecting my budget.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $912500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $912500 is still a bit out of my range. To reach a final agreement, I'm willing to go up to $890000. This is a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while also being within my budget. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $890000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, which would be $910000. This is a final compromise that reflects the product's value to you. What do you think?",910000.0,Alice,7,
