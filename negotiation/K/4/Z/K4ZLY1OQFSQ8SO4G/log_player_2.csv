Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value might be around $100 to you. Let's start with a fair offer. How about we aim for a price closer to my valuation? What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
