I'm starting with a high price of $18,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000.  I'm hoping Bob will either accept, or make a counteroffer that is still profitable for me. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm happy to sell to John for $12,000, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a higher price.  I want to see if he's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $15,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and his offer. I'm hoping that he'll see this as a fair price, considering my minimum value for the product is $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob is starting to come closer to my price.  While I'd prefer to get more, $13,500 is a good profit, and we're only in Round 4.  I don't want to risk losing out on this deal by being too greedy."
