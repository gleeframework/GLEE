"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay that amount if you're open to it.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While I understand your position, the product's value is considerably higher than your initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the unique benefits it offers.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you lowering the price, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $1,750,000. It's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I hope you consider it.",1750000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. While your offer is getting closer,  I'm still limited by my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,750,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to explore other options.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
