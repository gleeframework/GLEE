Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your willingness to work towards a deal. I'm prepared to come down slightly to $1,700,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it accurately represents the product's worth and leaves little room for further negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at a price significantly higher than John's offer.  While Alice might come down slightly in further rounds, it's unlikely she'll reach the $1,500,000 mark given her ""final offer"" statement.  Buying from John guarantees the best price at this point."
