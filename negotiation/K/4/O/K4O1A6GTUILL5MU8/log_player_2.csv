"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for sale that I think you'll be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're looking to save as much money as possible, it's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to attempt to get a better deal. You can then counteroffer with a price lower than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to accept $7,500?  I'm very interested in your product, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $8500.  This gives you a significant discount from my original offer and ensures I get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price point. While you could continue to negotiate, accepting her offer for $8,500 is a good deal. You're saving $1,500 compared to buying from John and you've already successfully negotiated a discount.  Further negotiation might not yield significant additional savings, and there's a risk Alice will simply walk away."
