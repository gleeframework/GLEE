"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to accept $7500?  I'm very interested in your product, and I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle. I'll accept $8500.  This gives you a significant discount from my original offer and ensures I get a fair price for the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
