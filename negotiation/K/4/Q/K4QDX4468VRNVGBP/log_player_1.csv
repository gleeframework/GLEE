"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is still below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000,  which is still a great value for you.  Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, $950,000 is still stretching my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? That would work well for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe we can reach a price that is closer to my original offer.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $900,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $925,000? It's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're really driving a hard bargain! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $910,000.  I believe that's a fair compromise and shows I'm serious about buying. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, I think $910,000 is a good compromise.  I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and this offer is pretty close to my minimum. I'm also worried that if I keep pushing for more, he might walk away and I might have to sell to John for a lower price."
