"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your ideal price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a better deal.  You have some room to bargain, as you value the product at $12,000, and Alice is willing to sell it for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $10,000? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500,  which is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $10,500, which is within my budget and a significant improvement from her initial offer. It's a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it. Buying from John for $12,000 would be more expensive, and while I could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed that Alice will go lower, and I risk losing the deal altogether."
