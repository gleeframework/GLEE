"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value to both of us, and I'm eager to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're serious about acquiring the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. This is my final offer - if you're willing to meet me here, I'm ready to make a deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I appreciate you getting closer to my price. However, I'm sticking with my offer of $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us. I'm ready to make the deal right now.",900000.0,Bob,6,
