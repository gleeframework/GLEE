"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to your business.  My research indicates it could be worth $1,000,000 to you.  I'm willing to let it go for $900,000, reflecting a significant discount based on its potential value to you. This is a one-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully.  If you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.** Even though Alice is claiming the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, her offer of $900,000 still saves Bob $100,000 compared to buying from John.
* **The goal is to save money.**  Bob's primary goal is to get the product at the lowest possible price. Accepting Alice's offer achieves this."
