"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  Since you have a backup option of buying from John for $1,000,000, you can use that as leverage to push Alice to lower her price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

While Alice's offer is closer to my target, I can still try to negotiate a lower price. I'm willing to pay a little more than John's price, but I want to see if I can get Alice to come down just a bit further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is firm on her price, and while $1,075,000 is still a good deal, it's not worth risking further negotiation. I can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so it's time to move on."
