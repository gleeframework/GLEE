"Hey Alice, $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $75 right now.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'd like to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92.50. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair deal considering the product's value.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $85, and I think that's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $85 yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $90. This is my final offer, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
