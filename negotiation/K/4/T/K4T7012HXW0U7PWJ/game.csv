"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm willing to accept. Could you consider something closer to $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. However, $13,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer!  I can tell you're serious about this.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  That's a very fair offer.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $11,500 is still a bit steep for me though.  Would you be willing to do it for $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
