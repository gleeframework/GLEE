"I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is my bottom line.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
