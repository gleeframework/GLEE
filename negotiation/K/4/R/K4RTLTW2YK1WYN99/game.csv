"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1300000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1200000. I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done.

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to maximize the value of this product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and counteroffer at $1250000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value I'm willing to walk away from if we can't come to an agreement. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1220000. However, I'm still not willing to give up on the value I'm looking for. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and counteroffer at $1240000. This is a compromise that still allows me to walk away with a decent profit.
