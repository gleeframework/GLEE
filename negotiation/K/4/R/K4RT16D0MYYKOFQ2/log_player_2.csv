"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth negotiating with Alice to try to get a lower price.  $1,700,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the product from John for $1,500,000.  Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's make it happen!

Alice is coming down, but $1,600,000 is still over Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down to a price closer to Bob's target. John is still a viable option if the negotiation fails."
