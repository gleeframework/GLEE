"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,700,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you've described. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's make it happen!",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and it's a price I believe is fair for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
