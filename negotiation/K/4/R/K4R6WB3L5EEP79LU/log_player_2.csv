{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? "", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While I value your offer, $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
