Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,175,000 is a bit too high, I'd like to try $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've been going back and forth for a while, and Bob seems unwilling to budge much further. With only two rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with him is too high.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I get a guaranteed sale and meet my minimum requirement."
