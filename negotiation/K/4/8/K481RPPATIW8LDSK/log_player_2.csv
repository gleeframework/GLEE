"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $13,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, especially considering its worth to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John**, as $13,000 is lower than $15,000.
* **However, Bob can potentially save more money.**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, and Alice values it at $8,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer is still better than buying from John, but Bob is trying to save as much as possible. 
* There's still room to negotiate, as Bob values the product at $15,000 and Alice values it at $8,000.  A counteroffer will allow Bob to try and get closer to his ideal price."
