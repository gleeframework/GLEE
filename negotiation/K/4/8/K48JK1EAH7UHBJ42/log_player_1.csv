"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to capture most of the potential profit.  Since the product is worth $15,000 to Bob, he has room to negotiate.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I'm confident I can get a better price with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit higher than my minimum.  I believe this counteroffer is still attractive to Bob while giving me a decent margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is now very close to my desired price point.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that he'll reject my counteroffer or the deal will fall apart altogether. Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
