"Bob, I believe this product is a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $1200000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. It's significantly below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1300000?  This would be a great deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1300000 is closer, I'm still looking for a slightly better price. How about $1250000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
