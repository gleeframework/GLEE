"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I believe this product is a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob's maximum price is $1,500,000, and Alice is willing to sell for at least $1,000,000. This means there's a significant gap for negotiation.  
* **Counteroffers:** By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price.  

While buying from John is an option, it's a last resort. It's always better to try to negotiate a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1200000 is simply too low for me. It's significantly below what this product is worth to me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1300000?  This would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer again. Here's why:

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's target, there's still room for a better deal. Alice has already lowered her price, indicating she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Aim for a lower price:**  By rejecting, Bob can make a counteroffer closer to his desired $1,200,000. 

While buying from John is always an option, it's best to continue exploring potential savings through negotiation with Alice."
