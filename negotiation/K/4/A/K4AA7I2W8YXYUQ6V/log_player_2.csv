"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I'm sure you'll see the value. My initial offer is $1,000,000. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  You can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John. You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000, and Alice's offer is $1,000,000,  so there's room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $900,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a good offer, I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, but $950,000 is still above your ideal price. You're aiming to save as much money as possible, so you should continue negotiating and try to get Alice to come down even further. You still have several rounds left to reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and allow us to close this transaction."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finally close this transaction. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your target price.  While you'd prefer a lower price, $940,000 is still a good deal compared to your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and John's price.  Accepting this offer saves you $260,000 compared to John's offer. You've achieved significant savings through negotiation, and continuing to bargain might not yield a significantly better result.  It's better to close the deal and secure this advantageous price."
