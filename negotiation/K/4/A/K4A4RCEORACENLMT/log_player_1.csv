Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, keeping in mind the strategy:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""value and potential"" helps justify the higher price, framing it as an investment rather than just a purchase.
* **Leaving Room:** While the offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it's unlikely he'll accept immediately. This opens the door for negotiation where you can gradually lower the price, potentially settling somewhere above your minimum. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insights into Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, passive), you might adjust your initial offer accordingly.
* **Market Information:**  If you had more information about the market demand for this type of product, you could tailor your offer more precisely.

**The key is to strike a balance between ambition (getting the highest price) and realism (not scaring Bob away with an outrageous initial offer).**"
