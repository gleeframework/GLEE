"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 12000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a significant amount closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value. I believe there's still room for negotiation, so I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm dropping my price a bit to show flexibility, but I'm still trying to secure a price that's significantly closer to my desired value.  I believe $11,000 is a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm again dropping my price to show willingness to compromise.  I'm confident that $10,500 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. I'm hoping this will be the price that closes the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are not progressing quickly enough.  While $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, the risk of further rounds resulting in a lower price is too great.  Selling to John for $15,000 will guarantee I get my desired price, even if it means ending the negotiations with Bob."
