"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. I know this is a valuable asset for you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,500,000 and Alice's offer is $1,500,000, you should reject the offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price, so there's no benefit to accepting Alice's offer."
