"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,200,000 is simply too far below the true value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This allows for a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that allows for a good deal for both of us. Let's find common ground and make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
