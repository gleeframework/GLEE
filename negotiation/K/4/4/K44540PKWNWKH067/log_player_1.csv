Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's well worth $200. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down a little.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, an outrageously high price might discourage Bob entirely. $200 is a significant markup but still within a reasonable range considering the product's value to him. 
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** We know John will buy the product for $150, so even if Bob rejects the offer, we won't be making a loss. This allows us to be a bit bolder in our initial ask."
