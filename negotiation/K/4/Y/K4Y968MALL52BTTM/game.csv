"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though. I'd be happy to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, $1,100,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1050,000. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to come up a little bit. How about $975,000? This is my final offer, otherwise I'll have to go with John.",975000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're making a final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, so I'll counter with $1075,000. This is my final offer as well. I'm not willing to go any lower.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
