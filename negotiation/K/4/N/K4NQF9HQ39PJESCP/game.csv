"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that the initial price was a bit steep, but I still believe the product's value to you is significant. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,200,000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further discussion if needed.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
