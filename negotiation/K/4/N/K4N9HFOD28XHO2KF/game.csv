"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this product at a fair market price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I can't accept that price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a compromise between our previous offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that work for you?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $750,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. Considering our previous offers, I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $825,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
