Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I believe it will be very valuable for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start with a higher price in negotiations. This leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a price of $120, you're ""anchoring"" Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point. Even if he rejects this initial offer, he might be more receptive to a slightly lower price later.
* **Knowing your Alternatives:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob."
