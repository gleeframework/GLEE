"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a great deal. I'm offering it to you for $250.",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $150. Can we meet in the middle at $175?",175.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $175. I'm willing to compromise, though! I'll meet you halfway between $250 and $175. How about we try $212.50?",212.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $212.50 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for a good product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about we try $180?",180.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for a good product. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll reduce the price to $200, which is still a bit above your original offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think I can do better. I'm willing to pay $185 for the product. Can we meet at that price?",185.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting close to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $185. I'll make one more compromise: I'll meet you at $195, which is still a bit above your original offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",195.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $195 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $180, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider other options.",180.0,Bob,8,

"I've reached the end of my budget and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to pay $180, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to buy the product from John for $100.",180.0,Bob,10,
