Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. Your goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible without exceeding Bob's perceived value. 
* **Unknown Information:** You don't know if Bob has other options or how desperate he is for the product.

**Strategy**

Aim high, but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll experience.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You start by emphasizing the ""exclusive opportunity"" to add a touch of desirability.
* **High Anchor:** The initial price of $1,100,000 sets a high anchor point, leaving room for negotiation while staying close to your target.
* **Value Justification:** You subtly remind Bob of the product's value and potential ROI, justifying the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** You end by showing a willingness to discuss, making Bob feel more in control.

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible offer. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiating style."
