"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a lot to you, and I believe we can strike a deal that benefits us both. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,500,000 to me, and Alice is offering it to me for $1,200,000, which is $300,000 less than its value to me. I can get the same product from John for $1,500,000, which is a better deal for me.
