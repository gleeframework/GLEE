"Bob, I understand your position. While I value our potential partnership, $950,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves some room for both of us to benefit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $960,000 is still below my minimum. I'm prepared to come down to $965,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value. Let's make a deal. ",965000.0,Alice,5,
