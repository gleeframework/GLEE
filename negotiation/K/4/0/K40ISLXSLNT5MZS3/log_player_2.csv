"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the original price I had in mind. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $10,500.  You can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing negotiations with Alice."
