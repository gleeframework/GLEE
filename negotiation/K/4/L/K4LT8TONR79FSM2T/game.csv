"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I was hoping to find something within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $12500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I think $12500 is still slightly above what I'm comfortable with. Could we possibly aim for $11000? I believe it would be a fair compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still need to make a profit. I can meet you at $12000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to consider other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I understand the need for a profit. I'd like to propose $11500 as a compromise. It's a bit higher than my initial budget, but I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're getting close to your target, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11500 and $12000. I can do $11750. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can finally agree on a price.",11750.0,Alice,7,
