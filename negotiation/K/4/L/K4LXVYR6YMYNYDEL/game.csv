"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",950000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree the product has value, my budget is firm. Would you consider $800,000?  This would be a clean deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,,
