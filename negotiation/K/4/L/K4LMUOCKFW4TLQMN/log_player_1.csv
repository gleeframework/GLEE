Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, giving me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round.  I'll need to be careful, though, as John's offer is a good alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with $120. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and still leaves me with a profit.  If Bob accepts, great!  If not, I'll need to seriously consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is finally acceptable. It's above my minimum price and  a good compromise.  While John's offer is still a safe option, I'm willing to take a slight risk and accept Bob's offer."
