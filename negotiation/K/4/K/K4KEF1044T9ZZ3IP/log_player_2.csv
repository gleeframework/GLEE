Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob, but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $120, and you're aiming for the best possible deal. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $100 from John. It makes sense to cut negotiations with Alice and go with the sure thing at this point."
