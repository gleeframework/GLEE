"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,500,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it has significant value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the value and opportunity of the product.
* **Open to Discussion:** My message invites Bob to respond, starting a dialogue. 

This approach aims to:

* Gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay.
* Set a starting point for negotiation.
* Avoid rushing into a deal that might not be optimal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1200000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum value.**  While it's tempting to take it, I'm not desperate. 
* **I have 9 rounds left.** This gives me room to try and get a better price. 
* **I want to see if I can push Bob higher.** By rejecting his offer, I can signal that I'm not willing to settle for the bare minimum and see if he's willing to compromise. 

I'm not ready to sell to John yet because there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the true value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the price is still reflective of the product's value. 
* **Inviting Negotiation:** I'm using an open-ended question to keep the dialogue going and encourage further discussion.

This approach aims to:

*  Signal my willingness to negotiate.
*  Test Bob's commitment to the deal.
*  See if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my budget, I am comfortable to consider $1300000 as a potential price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Getting Closer:** Bob has moved closer to my desired price. We're only $50,000 apart.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject his offer, there's a chance he might walk away, and I might have to settle for John's $1,200,000 offer. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We are only in round 4. I have more rounds left, but it's getting tighter.

Considering these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision. It's a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
