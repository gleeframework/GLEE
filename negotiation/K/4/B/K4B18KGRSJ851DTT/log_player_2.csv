"Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $120 for the product.
* Alice's offer of $115 is close to your limit, but there is room for negotiation.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer, potentially saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering $110, which is $5 lower than Alice's initial offer.
* This is a reasonable compromise, and still within my budget.
* It's likely that Alice will accept this offer, as it's still a profit for her."
