Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, bringing us closer to our ideal outcome. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  It's important to remember we have John as a backup buyer. This gives us leverage to aim higher with Bob, knowing we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 if needed."
