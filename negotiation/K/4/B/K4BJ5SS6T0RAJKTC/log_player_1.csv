Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while staying above my minimum ($100).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $95 leaves some wiggle room in case Bob tries to negotiate the price down slightly.  
* **Time Value:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $100, selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even at a slightly lower price. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob and ensuring a sale."
