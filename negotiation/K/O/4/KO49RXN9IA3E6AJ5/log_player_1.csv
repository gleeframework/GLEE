Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $11,500. I think it could really benefit you and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $10,000 valuation as possible while still making a significant profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Time Value:** While Alice has a guaranteed sale with John, a quicker sale to Bob might be more desirable even with a slightly lower profit margin."
