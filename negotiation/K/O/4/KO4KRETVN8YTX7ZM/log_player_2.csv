"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is much higher than both your budget and John's offer. It makes sense to negotiate down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is coming down, $1,400,000 is still above your budget and John's offer. You have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,400,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Would you consider $1,100,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

We're pushing the negotiation closer to our ideal price while still leaving some room for Alice to counter.  We want to appear motivated but not desperate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're trying to drive a hard bargain. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but we're still above John's price. We'll continue negotiating, but we're getting into the territory where John's offer might become the better option soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're almost there. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 to get this deal done. That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

We're inching closer to our budget but signaling a willingness to compromise slightly to close the deal. This leaves room for a final counteroffer from Alice while staying above John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is very close to our limit, but we're now only $50,000 away from John's price. It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can get closer to $1,200,000.  We're running out of rounds, so this is a risky move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to go up to $1,210,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping we can close this out now."",
""product_price"": 1210000
}
```

This counteroffer is a gamble. It's a significant jump from our previous offer, signaling to Alice that we're serious about closing the deal but also nearing our absolute limit. We're hoping she'll see it as a bridge too far to reject and try to counter again, pushing her closer to accepting a final offer near $1,200,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,210,000, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to make one last push to get the deal done. How about we meet at $1,280,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $1,250,000, and we've reached an impasse. John's offer of $1,200,000 is our best alternative at this point. It's better to secure the product at a price we know is reasonable than risk losing it entirely by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
