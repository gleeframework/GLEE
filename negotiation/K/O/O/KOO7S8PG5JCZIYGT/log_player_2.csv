"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $1200000, which is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price. While it's a fair price, there's no benefit to accepting it. You can get the same product from John for the same price.  It's better to go with John and avoid any potential risk of the deal falling through with Alice."
