"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $9,500 for this product. This is a fair price considering the value it offers you. Let's meet halfway.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,200. Can you consider that?",9200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,200, but I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but $9,400 is the lowest I can go. This is a significant investment for you, and this product will provide you with substantial value. Let's close this deal.",9400.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,250, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",9250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I'd prefer $9,400,  I'm willing to go down to $9,300.  This is a fair price for both of us. It allows me to make a decent profit, and it's still a great value for you. Let's close this deal.",9300.0,Alice,7,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,300 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,150. Can you consider that?",9150.0,Bob,8,
