"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, so let me know what you think!",25000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $25000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8000 is just too low. How about we split the difference and I come down to $16500? This still leaves me room to make a profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12000 for the product. Is that more reasonable?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $14000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",14000.0,Alice,5,
