Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset that I know will be a great investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$950,000:** This is a starting point that's significantly higher than my minimum of $800,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  It's polite and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making him more likely to consider my offer. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value, I aim to:

* **Encourage negotiation:** Bob is more likely to make a counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his true interest.
* **Maximize potential earnings:**  While $950,000 is less than Bob's maximum, it's a strong starting point that leaves room for a compromise.
* **Minimize risk:**  It's better to start higher than lower, as I have the option to lower my price later, but I can't raise it if I start too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer and close to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm rejecting Bob's offer to continue the negotiation and try to increase the price further. 

**Strategy:**

* **Continue negotiation:**  I believe I have more leverage given Bob's interest and the fact that he's already made a counteroffer.
* **Maximize potential earnings:**  I'm still hopeful I can get closer to $950,000 or even higher.
* **Assess the risk:**  While selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed option, I'm willing to take a risk to try and earn more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I see your point about the market value. However, considering the unique features of this product and its potential for your business, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while providing you with a valuable asset. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000:** This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Message:**  I reiterate the value of the product and frame this as a compromise for both of us. 
* **Strategy:**

By offering $900,000, I aim to:

* **Show flexibility:**  Demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate creates trust and encourages further discussions.
* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  By making a counteroffer, I avoid a stalemate and maintain the momentum.
* **Maximize potential earnings:** While less than my initial offer, $900,000 is still significantly higher than my minimum and a better outcome than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $825,000 is getting dangerously close to my minimum of $800,000.  While continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly higher price, the risk of Bob walking away is too high. 

**Strategy:**

* **Minimize risk:**  Selling to John for $800,000 guarantees a sale and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation.
* **Time constraints:**  It's possible that Bob's budget is truly limited, and further negotiation might just lead to a stalemate.
* **Opportunity cost:**  I'm already close to my minimum, and the potential gain from further negotiation might not be worth the time and effort involved.

By selling to John, I secure a decent profit while minimizing risk."
