"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $14,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a price closer to our $12,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility. It's a common negotiation tactic to start low and work your way up."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would still be a great deal for you and a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met our target price of $12,000. There's no point in rejecting and potentially risking losing the deal, especially since we can't get a better price from John."
