{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for your company, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on investment. My initial price is $1,400,000. Let's discuss this further."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so he has room to increase his offer further. It's better to try and get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,300,000. This price still allows me to make a good profit while offering you a significant advantage. Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $1,300,000 price tag. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,250,000 is closer to my goal, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident Bob has more room to offer, and I want to keep negotiating for a better price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,250,000 still falls short of what this product is truly worth. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects both the value of the product and our desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant advantages this product will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the $1,350,000 price tag. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,300,000. I believe this is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is now offering the price I initially countered with in Round 3. I have been rejecting his offers hoping to get closer to my goal of $1,400,000. However, I've reached the halfway point of the rounds, and it's becoming risky to keep rejecting his offers. Accepting his offer at $1,300,000 is a good deal, as it is still above my minimum of $1,000,000 and much closer to my desired price."
