"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but I believe I can't justify spending such a high amount. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,500,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,900,000 is already a competitive price considering the significant value this product holds.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still feel that the product's price is quite high. Could you possibly lower it to $1,600,000? I'm hoping to find a fair compromise between our positions.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
