Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **You want to save money.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  You're better off trying to negotiate with Alice first."
