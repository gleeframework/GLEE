"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a price of $9500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $11000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $10500 for the product. I hope this proposal is closer to what you're looking for.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to sweeten the deal. I'm willing to throw in some additional support and services worth $500, which would bring the total value to $11000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your proposal, Alice. While I appreciate the additional support and services, I am still aiming to keep my expenses within my budget. I would like to counteroffer at $10750 for the product. This includes the value of the additional services you mentioned, without adding extra cost to me.",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to consider the additional services. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11500. I'm willing to throw in one more sweetener: I'll give you a 6-month warranty on the product, which is a $1000 value. This would bring the total value to $12500. I'm willing to meet you at this price. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest proposal, Alice. I appreciate the warranty and the additional services, but I am still working within a specific budget. I would like to counteroffer at $11250 for the product. This includes the value of the warranty and services you've offered, while keeping my expenses within my target range.",11250.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $11250, but I need to make it clear that this is my final offer. I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm confident that the product's value justifies this price, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,9,
