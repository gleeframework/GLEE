Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise.  However, to be honest, $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $9,750? I think that's a fair offer, and it would allow us to reach an agreement quickly.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

This is a great product, but I need to be realistic about what I can afford. I'd be willing to pay $9,900 as my final offer.  If that doesn't work, I think I'll need to explore other options.
