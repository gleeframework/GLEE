"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a great price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  He's willing to pay up to $150, so there's room for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it.  $130 is a bit high for me though. How about $115? I'm really interested in this product and I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $115 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $125, which is still a good deal for Bob. He's willing to pay up to $150, and $125 saves him $25 compared to buying from John.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might walk away or counter with an offer he's not happy with.  At this point, accepting the offer seems like the best strategy."
