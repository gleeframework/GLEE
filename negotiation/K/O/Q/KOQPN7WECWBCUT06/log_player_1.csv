Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,600,000 vs. $1,200,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher final sale price. 
* **Anchoring:** This high initial price acts as an ""anchor"" in Bob's mind. Even if he intends to negotiate down, he's now working from a higher starting point.
* **Backup Offer:** It's important to note that you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000. This gives you leverage in negotiations, as you don't *need* to accept an offer below that price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  It's unknown how price-sensitive Bob is or how much he might be willing to negotiate. 
* **Relationship:** A very high initial offer might alienate Bob if he's looking for a more collaborative approach.  Consider your existing relationship when choosing your strategy.

This initial offer is designed to maximize your potential profit. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower your price during further discussions with Bob."
