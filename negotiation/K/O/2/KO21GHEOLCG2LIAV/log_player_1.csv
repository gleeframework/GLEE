Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This leaves some room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will find the product valuable enough to pay close to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering with $135. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible but still want to get a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now lower than my minimum acceptable price. I've already made concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll take John's offer of $120, which is still a good price for me."
