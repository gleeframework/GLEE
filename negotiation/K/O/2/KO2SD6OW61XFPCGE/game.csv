"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and I believe it's a great deal for you. Let me know what you think!",9000.0,Alice,1,,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer,7000.0
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",7000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This would still give you a good price for the product, and I wouldn't be losing too much.",8500.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,8000.0
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we aim for $8,250? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",8250.0,Bob,4,,
