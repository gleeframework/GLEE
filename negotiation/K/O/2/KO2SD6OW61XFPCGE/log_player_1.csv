"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and I believe it's a great deal for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, leaving room for negotiation.  This first offer sets the stage and gives Bob a clear idea of my starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price, so I'm going to reject it. I'm going to counteroffer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This would still give you a good price for the product, and I wouldn't be losing too much."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we aim for $8,250? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only slightly below my minimum acceptable price, and it seems like he's firm on this price.  I'm better off accepting his offer to avoid further negotiation and potential delays.  While I would have preferred my initial asking price, it's a good deal considering the circumstances."
