"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $130 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $110? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $125, which would be $117.50. Would you be willing to accept that price?",117.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $117.50 is a good compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $125 and $117.50, which would be $121.25. It's still a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",121.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget limit, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $121.25 and $117.50, which would be $119.375. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $80.",119.375,Bob,8,
