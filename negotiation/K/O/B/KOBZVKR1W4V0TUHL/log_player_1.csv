Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,200 is better than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher price. There's still room for negotiation and I'm not willing to settle for a lowball offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,200 is a good starting point, it's not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,850.  This is a fair price, considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 10850}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle on $10,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $10,500.  This is only $500 less than my last counteroffer, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price ($10,000).  It's unlikely that Bob will go higher, and I risk losing the deal altogether if I continue negotiating.  It's time to accept and secure a sale."
