"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,200?"",
""product_price"": 10200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still above her perceived value. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while aiming for a price well below our $12,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,200 is a good starting point, it's not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,850.  This is a fair price, considering the value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is negotiating, but $10,850 is still too high. We'll continue negotiating and see if we can push the price closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle on $10,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're nudging closer to Alice's value while still leaving some room for negotiation. By proposing a specific number and framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" we're subtly encouraging Alice to accept."
