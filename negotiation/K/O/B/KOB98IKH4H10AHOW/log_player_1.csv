Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. While $1,300,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable offer, it's unlikely he'll reach the minimum I need. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
