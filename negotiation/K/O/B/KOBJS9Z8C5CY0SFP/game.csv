"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you. Let's make this happen!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
