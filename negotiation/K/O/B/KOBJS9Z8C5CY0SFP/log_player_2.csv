"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is looking to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better deal than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the initial offer and see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to Alice's minimum value ($8,000) as possible. This offer is a good starting point for negotiation, leaving some room for compromise while still being significantly lower than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a better deal than buying from John, Bob can likely still get a better price. There's room for negotiation, and Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He should reject the offer and try to get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob continues to aim for a price closer to Alice's minimum value.  This counteroffer is a reasonable compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a better deal."
