Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise and it would be a shame to miss out on the potential it offers.  I'm willing to part with it for $1,190,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going under, while still leaving room for profit.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. This allows us to confidently aim higher with Bob. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:** The message hints at the product's value and positions the offer as a potential loss for Bob if rejected, encouraging him to accept.

This strategy aims to secure a substantial profit from Bob while ensuring a guaranteed sale at our desired price if he declines."
