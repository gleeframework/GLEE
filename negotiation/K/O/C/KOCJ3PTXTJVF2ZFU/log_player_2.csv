Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer.  At $125, you're still saving $25 compared to buying from John.  While you could continue to counteroffer, there's no guarantee Alice will keep lowering her price, and you risk ending up with a higher price or even losing the product."
