"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is still a good deal for both of us considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if you're interested.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? That's the best I can do.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $975,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value you've placed on it.  If you're not able to accept this offer, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers.",975000.0,Alice,5,
