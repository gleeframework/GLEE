{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves you room to negotiate down if necessary and still make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps keep the negotiation focused and efficient.

By offering this price, you can assess Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball. If he rejects, you can always make a counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I need to achieve my minimum. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to settle for that price. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price is still a good deal for both of us considering the value you place on the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,000,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm confident that I can get a better price.  John is waiting in the wings, so I'm not under pressure to accept anything less than what I need."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer you the product for $975,000.  This is a very fair price considering the value you've placed on it.  If you're not able to accept this offer, I'll need to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 975000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has been persistent, but he's not willing to budge from his $950,000 offer. While that's closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to make this a worthwhile deal.  John is a reliable buyer and will pay my desired price. It's time to move on to a sure thing and sell to John."
