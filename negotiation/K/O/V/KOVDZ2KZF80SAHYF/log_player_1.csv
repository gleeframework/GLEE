"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's valuation to leave room for negotiation. I'm confident that I can get at least $8,000, and I'm hoping to get closer to $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle at $8,250?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,800. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,800 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob a little higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is my absolute minimum.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8000}
