"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $900,000. Can we discuss further?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is considerably below its true value and potential return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's potential, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $1,025,000. Can we discuss further?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
