"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but still within a range that might be appealing to Bob. 
* **Positive message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Setting the stage:** This offer sets the stage for potential negotiation, allowing me to see if Bob is willing to play along or walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Strategic rejection:**  Rejecting this offer allows me to maintain my negotiating leverage and potentially secure a higher price. 
* **Opportunity to counter:** By rejecting, I can now make a counteroffer, hopefully finding a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $135. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the fairness and potential for satisfaction.
* **Maintain control:** By keeping the price above my minimum, I'm still in a position to potentially get a higher price if Bob is truly interested."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to a deal, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $125 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited negotiation rounds:** We're in round 6, and I've already made several compromises. 
* **Guaranteed sale to John:** John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time is valuable:**  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I have a secure offer from John.

**This is a strategic decision:** It's better to secure a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price than to risk further negotiation and potentially getting a lower price or no deal at all."
