"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's start the conversation! ",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, while I understand you're looking for a lower price, $900,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to recoup some of my investment.  How about $1,050,000? This would be a fair compromise that would still be a great value for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're keen on getting a good deal. Let's aim for a win-win situation. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,025,000. This offer still allows me to recoup my investment, and it's a great price for you, given the value the product holds for your business.  What do you say?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from it.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $1,025,000. It's the best I can do, considering the product's worth to you. If you're not willing to pay that, I'm seriously considering selling to John for $1,000,000.  Let me know your final decision.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to stick to your last offer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,012,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John.",1012500.0,Bob,8,
