"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $900,000 is too low for me. I believe I can get a better price. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, while I understand you're looking for a lower price, $900,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to recoup some of my investment.  How about $1,050,000? This would be a fair compromise that would still be a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, I'm still not convinced it's a fair price considering the product's value to him. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're keen on getting a good deal. Let's aim for a win-win situation. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,025,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer, $975,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of the product to him. I'll counter-offer in the next round, but I'm getting closer to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to come to an agreement.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $1,025,000. It's the best I can do, considering the product's worth to you. If you're not willing to pay that, I'm seriously considering selling to John for $1,000,000.  Let me know your final decision."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to stick to your last offer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,012,500. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,012,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,012,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $1,012,500 is better than selling to John for $1,000,000. It's a good compromise, and it's time to close the deal."
