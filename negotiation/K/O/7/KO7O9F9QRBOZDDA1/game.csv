"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $1,000,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
