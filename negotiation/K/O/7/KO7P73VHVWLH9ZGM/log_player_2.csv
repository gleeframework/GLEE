"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I think you'll really benefit from having this product, and I'm willing to make a concession to make it happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her, closer to her $8,000 value. If she doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John."
