,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to buy it for $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal!",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference at $90?  I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $90 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This is my final offer.  Let's close this deal!",92.5,Alice,5,
