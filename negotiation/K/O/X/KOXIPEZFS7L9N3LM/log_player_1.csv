Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $12,000 is still below my minimum, and I have more rounds to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still a bit lower than I hoped for, it's getting closer to my minimum price.  I don't want to risk going through more rounds and potentially ending up with John's offer of $10,000."
