"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $900,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $850,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your target, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,5,
