I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from my minimum price of $12,000, but still allows for a good profit. I believe this price is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while also leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous one. It's still a good profit for me, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince Bob to buy."

Bob's offer is still too low for me. Even though I could continue negotiating, the risk of a longer negotiation leading to a lower price is too high. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees my minimum acceptable price and avoids further risk."
