"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Could you consider $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $7,500 is really pushing the limit for me. This product is worth a significant amount, and I'm offering it at a fair price. The best I can do is $9,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Alice,5,
