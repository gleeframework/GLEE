Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I would like to propose a price closer to my valuation. How about $750,000? This still allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
