"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $110 is still above your maximum budget of $120. 
* It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within the range where both of us might be willing to negotiate. 
* This gives Alice room to counter, but it also shows I'm serious about getting a better price. 
* It's also closer to my ideal price of $80, but leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While $105 is closer to my target price, it's still above my ideal of $80.
* I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, and I believe there's still room for further negotiation.  
* I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a good price. 
* $100 is a reasonable compromise, closer to Alice's offer and within my budget. 
* This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and hopefully lead to a deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  Alice has come down to $108, which is still above my ideal price but within my budget of $120. 
*  I've already rejected two counteroffers, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price. 
*  It's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I risk losing out on the product altogether if I keep rejecting. 
*  Accepting at $108 secures the product and saves me $12 compared to buying from John."
