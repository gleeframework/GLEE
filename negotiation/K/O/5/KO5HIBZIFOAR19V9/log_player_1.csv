Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. My asking price is $11,000."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your maximum potential profit. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still attractive compared to your guaranteed sale price. This might encourage Bob to counter-offer if he's truly interested while still giving you a good profit margin. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk that Bob will reject the offer outright. However, this strategy aims to balance risk and potential reward."
