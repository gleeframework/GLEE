I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,400,000. This leaves a significant profit margin for me while still being a good deal for Bob, as it's less than the $1,500,000 he values it at. This initial offer is a good starting point to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,300,000.  This is a compromise, moving closer to his offer while still maintaining a substantial profit for me.  I believe this price is fair and  will likely encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is getting too close to my minimum threshold.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose a deal entirely.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a sale and secures a decent profit."
