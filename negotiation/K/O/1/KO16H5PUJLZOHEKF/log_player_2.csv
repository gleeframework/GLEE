"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. How about $8,500? That's still a good price for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me some room to profit.  Let's work together to find a price we're both happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.
