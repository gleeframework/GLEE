"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $13,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,250?",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,125? It's a fair price that's within my budget and still provides you with a good profit.",10125.0,Bob,4,
