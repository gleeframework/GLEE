Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 14500} 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, aiming to maximize my profit while leaving some room for negotiation.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup offer from John at $15,000, which provides me with a solid baseline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and selling to John would net me a significantly higher profit.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous offer, acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to go much higher. However, I'm still significantly above his counteroffer, aiming to find a middle ground.  This counteroffer also leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial counteroffer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to push for a higher price and see if we can find a middle ground. There's still potential for a better deal with Bob, and I'm not willing to settle for less than $14,000 at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm making a final counteroffer at $13,500, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range. I believe this offer presents a fair compromise for both parties and increases the chances of closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we've gone back and forth several times. It's becoming clear that we're not going to reach an agreement.  I'm not willing to keep negotiating and risk wasting more time.  Selling to John for $15,000 will secure my desired price and avoid further potential losses."
