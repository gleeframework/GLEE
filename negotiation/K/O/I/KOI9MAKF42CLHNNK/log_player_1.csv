"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $180. It's a great deal and worth every penny!  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to pique Bob's interest while also establishing a starting point that's beneficial to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little high for me, would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  It's far below my minimum, and even below what the product is worth to him. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $60 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good price, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's meet in the middle. "", ""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm trying to find a price that is still profitable for me while also being attractive to Bob.  $120 is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing good faith, but it's still above my minimum and closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still too low with his offer. While it's tempting to go for something, I'm still above my minimum and want to try to get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not there yet at $75. I'm willing to drop a little further, how about $100?  Let's close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm continuing to lower my price, but I'm still above my minimum value.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.  I'm hoping that by offering a clear price and emphasizing the desire to close the deal, I can encourage him to accept."
