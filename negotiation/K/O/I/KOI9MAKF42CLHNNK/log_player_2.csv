Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $60 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good price, but I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's meet in the middle.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still not there yet at $75. I'm willing to drop a little further, how about $100?  Let's close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to come down to a price close enough to your $80 limit. She's still asking for $100, and you're running out of rounds to negotiate. It's better to secure the product from John at a price you know is acceptable than risk ending up with nothing."
