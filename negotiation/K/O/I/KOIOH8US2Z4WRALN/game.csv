"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  That's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95, which is a good compromise.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
