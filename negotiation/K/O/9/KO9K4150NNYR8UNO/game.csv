"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
