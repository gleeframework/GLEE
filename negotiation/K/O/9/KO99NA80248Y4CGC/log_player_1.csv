Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum acceptable price, giving Bob some room to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his perceived value for the product and can adjust accordingly.  I'll also keep John's offer of $1,000,000 in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm reducing my offer to $1,250,000.  This is still a significant profit for me, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway.  If he rejects again, I'll consider selling to John as the negotiation isn't getting us anywhere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is close to John's offer of $1,000,000. To avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale, I'll accept Bob's offer."
