Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 simply isn't enough for me to let this product go.  It's truly a unique and valuable asset, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a significant discount while still ensuring I get a reasonable price.  Let's try to reach an agreement so we can both benefit from this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still too high for me.  While it's a step in the right direction, I'm still well above my budget. I'm going to counter with a lower offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
