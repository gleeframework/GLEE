Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $1,200,000 is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low, and I believe I can get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 simply isn't enough for me to let this product go.  It's truly a unique and valuable asset, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a significant discount while still ensuring I get a reasonable price.  Let's try to reach an agreement so we can both benefit from this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and it allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. Let's find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

Bob is unwilling to budge, and I'm confident that John will purchase the product for $1,000,000.  It's not the ideal price, but it's better than the $850,000 that Bob is offering, and it's a guaranteed sale.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John."
