"I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $135, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $125 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $130, which is as low as I'm willing to go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $120?",120.0,Bob,6,
