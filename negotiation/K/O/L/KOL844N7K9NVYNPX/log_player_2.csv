"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm getting a bit close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  While I could try to negotiate further, Alice is signaling that she's close to her minimum.  $115 is a reasonable price, and continuing to haggle risks pushing her away and forcing me to buy from John at the higher price."
