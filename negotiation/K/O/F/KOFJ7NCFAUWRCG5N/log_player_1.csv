"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable price ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Friendly approach:** A friendly message establishes a positive tone and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Open-ended question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" allows Bob to respond with a counteroffer, giving us the opportunity to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe I can offer you $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for me:** $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe I can still get a higher price by negotiating further.
* **Avoiding immediate sale to John:** While selling to John guarantees $100, there's a chance I can secure a better price with Bob through further negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob.  I appreciate your interest.  While I value your offer, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you consider $105?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing finding a price that works for both of us, aiming to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to offer $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further gain:**  There's no guarantee I can get a higher price by continuing the negotiation.
* **Avoiding potential losses:**  Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob will walk away, leaving me with only John's offer of $100. Accepting Bob's offer secures my minimum goal."
