"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $1,200,000. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum value. I'm not going to sell it at that price right now. I'm going to try to get a better offer from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $1,400,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not going to sell it for that price. I'll try to get a better offer from him."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to negotiate at this point."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm not willing to go that low. I'll try to get a better offer from him or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $1,250,000. This is very close to my minimum, but I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm serious about getting this deal done.  I'm running out of rounds and need to make a decision soon."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm only left with two rounds and I'm not sure I can get a better offer from him. I'm going to sell to John for $1,200,000. This is a safer bet than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
