{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's valuation, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get by making the purchase, even at this price. 
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to create a sense of urgency by hinting at the possibility of selling to John for a higher price if Bob doesn't agree. This might push Bob to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  It's a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to me and you're still getting a good profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I can try to get a higher price from Bob. 
* **John is a backup option:**  Having John as an alternative buyer gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at this price. 

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price, considering it's worth $8,000 to me and it's closer to your previous offer.  Let's see if we can make this deal work.
