"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000.  It's a fair price considering it's worth $8,000 to me and you're still getting a good profit.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my need to make a profit. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price, considering it's worth $8,000 to me and it's closer to your previous offer.  Let's see if we can make this deal work.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value and my need to make a profit.  This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,
