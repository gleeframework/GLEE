"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair, I can't let it go that low, but I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product and presents a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the product's value.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
