Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your initial asking price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and even below his perceived value. I'll try to meet him closer to his valuation.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value.  To be fair, I can't let it go that low, but I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This offer reflects my serious interest while acknowledging the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This offer is getting closer to my minimum. It's time to decide if I want to risk losing Bob to get closer to my desired price.

While I could potentially get more from Bob, John's offer guarantees my minimum acceptable profit. It's not worth the risk of Bob walking away."
