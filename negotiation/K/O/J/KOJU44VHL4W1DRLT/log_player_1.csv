Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $1500000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Bob's offer:
