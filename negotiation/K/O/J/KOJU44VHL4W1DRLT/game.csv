"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in your product, $1500000 is above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $1000000 is unfortunately below my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $1250000? I'm confident this price still represents great value for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1250000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $1150000?  I'm sure we can both be happy with this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1150000 is still not quite there for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1200000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
