"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it for $1500000. This is a significant discount, as I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1000000.  This is a one-time offer. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice is trying to pressure you with a sense of urgency and a seemingly ""good deal,"" but it's still above your maximum budget.  You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no need to accept Alice's offer."
