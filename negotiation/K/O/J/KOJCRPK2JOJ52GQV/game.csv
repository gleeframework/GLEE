"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little to $1050000.  This would still be a good deal for both of us. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975000. Can you consider my offer?,975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $975000 is still too far off for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $1012500? That's a fair compromise that will allow both of us to walk away satisfied.",1012500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $995000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000.",995000.0,Bob,6,
