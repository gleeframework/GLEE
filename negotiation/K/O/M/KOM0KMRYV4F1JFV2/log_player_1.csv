I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $14,000 is below my minimum value. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm offering a price of $16,000.  This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his offer and still exceeding my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's just slightly above my minimum value and it avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John for a lower price."
