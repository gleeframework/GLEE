Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is a good offer, it falls slightly short of what I need to make this deal work for me.

This price still reflects the significant worth of the product, but also demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's make this happen!
