"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I value our potential partnership, $8,000 is too low for me at this point. I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which reflects the unique value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my price range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,000 to try and find some middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,000.  It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
