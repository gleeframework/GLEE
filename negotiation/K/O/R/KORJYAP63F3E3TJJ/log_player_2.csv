"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $6,500 is a good deal, you're aiming to save as much as possible. There are still 9 rounds left, and you can likely negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price, aiming to start the negotiation strongly.  This counteroffer is still within the range where I can potentially save money compared to buying from John, but it's low enough to signal my serious intent to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down on price, but I still have time to push for a better deal. There are still 7 rounds left. I believe I can get closer to my target price without risking losing the deal entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her offer, indicating she's willing to negotiate. My counteroffer of $5800 is a compromise â€“  it's a step up from my previous offer but still lower than Alice's current price.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still holding firm at a higher price than I'd like, but I still have 5 rounds remaining.  I believe I can continue to negotiate and get a better price. Buying from John at this point would mean losing out on potential savings, and there's a chance Alice will eventually be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but I'm still aiming to save a bit more. I'm increasing my counteroffer to $6,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and her current one. With 4 rounds left, I'm hoping this will be a good midpoint for a potential agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are in the 7th round, leaving us with only 3 rounds left. While I'd prefer to save even more money, accepting Alice's offer at $6,300 is a good deal considering my goal of $8,000.  With limited rounds remaining, the risk of further negotiation failing and being forced to buy from John at $8,000 is too high. It's time to secure the deal and save the money I've already negotiated."
