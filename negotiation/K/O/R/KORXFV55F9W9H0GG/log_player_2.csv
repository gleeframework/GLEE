# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for both of us. You get a valuable asset for a price that's well below its true worth, and I get to sell it to someone who will appreciate it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.
