"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $1,000,000. Let me know if that's more in line with your budget.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $700,000?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to make a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think $900,000 is the lowest I can go. This is a good price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
