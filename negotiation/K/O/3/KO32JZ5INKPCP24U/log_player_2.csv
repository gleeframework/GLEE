"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John offers.  You should definitely try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also sets a starting point that is closer to your desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $100 is significantly lower than what I had in mind. Could you do $140? It's a compromise towards a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to your acceptable price, $140 is still more than you need to spend. There's room to negotiate further towards your $120 goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $100 is a big drop, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $120?  That seems like a fair deal to me."",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Compromise:** You acknowledge Alice's move towards your price while also moving up yourself.
* **Target Price:**  You've now hit your maximum acceptable price.
* **Clear Rationale:**  ""Meeting in the middle"" provides a simple and understandable justification for your offer.

Now it's up to Alice to decide if she values the sale at $120 or prefers to hold out for a potentially higher offer."
