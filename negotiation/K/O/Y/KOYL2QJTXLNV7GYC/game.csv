"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Can you meet me at $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that the product has good quality and features, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $120, which would be $100. Can you consider that?",100.0,Bob,4,
