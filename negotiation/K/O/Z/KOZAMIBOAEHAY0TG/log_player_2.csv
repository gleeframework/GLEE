**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I'm not going to buy from her yet. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,150,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial one, it's still higher than my maximum budget. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price again.  I'll try to push closer to my limit."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,120,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,120,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, it seems unlikely that Alice will drop to my target price. To avoid further delays and ensure I get the product, I'm going to purchase it from John for $1,000,000."
