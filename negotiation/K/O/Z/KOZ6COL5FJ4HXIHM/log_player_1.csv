Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. I know it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000. This is a rare opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you want to start high to maximize your potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested. 
* **Emphasizing value:** The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Creating a sense of urgency:**  The phrase ""rare opportunity"" hints that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.

By starting high, Alice increases her chances of:

1. **Getting a price closer to her ideal outcome:**  Even if Bob negotiates down, there's a good chance the final price will be higher than John's offer.
2. **A quick sale:** Bob might accept the offer outright to avoid missing out on a product he values."
