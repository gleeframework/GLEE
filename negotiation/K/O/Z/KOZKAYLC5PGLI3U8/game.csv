"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. I understand its worth to you is $800000, and while I value it significantly higher, I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. This allows for a considerable margin for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1050000?  It's a fair compromise that leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
