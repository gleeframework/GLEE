"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's below his perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that I'm willing to be flexible, which can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a slightly higher price, I've already been through a few rounds of negotiation, and $13,200 is a good price that exceeds my minimum.  It's getting closer to my minimum, and it's not worth risking the deal falling through entirely."
