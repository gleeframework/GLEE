"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and makes the negotiation feel less adversarial. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Mentioning the product being ""fantastic"" subtly implies its worth to Bob, reminding him of the potential value he'll receive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Gap:**  Bob's offer is still significantly higher than my minimum ($80), but it's lower than the value I initially aimed for. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and explore a price closer to my initial target.  
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  There's a chance Bob is willing to pay more if I push back a little. 
* **No Urgent Need:** I still have 9 rounds to close a deal, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is a little too low for me. How about $110? It's still a great price for such a fantastic product!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but not completely closing the door. This counteroffer shows I'm flexible but still trying to get a better price.
* **Compromise:** $110 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to keep him interested in negotiating further. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. Considering my budget, would it be possible for us to agree on $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is still above my minimum selling price of $80. This gives me room to continue negotiating for a higher price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's a chance Bob is willing to go a little higher, especially considering the product's worth to him.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  By rejecting this offer, I can maintain leverage in the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Rounds Remaining:**  I still have several rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate!  $105 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $108? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Adjustment:**  I'm offering a small counteroffer ($108) that's only $3 away from Bob's offer. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal but still trying to get a slightly higher price.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price for both of us"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm expressing a desire to ""finally close this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
