"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. To start, I'll offer it to you for $120. Would you like to accept this offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both my maximum budget and John's offer. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I have a limit of $80 in mind. Would you consider a price closer to that?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm beginning with an offer significantly lower than my actual budget. This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:**  By stating my $80 limit, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message conveys a willingness to negotiate further, signaling that this isn't my final offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I believe we can find a middle ground. I am willing to accept $90 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice moved closer to my range, $90 is still above my target and what John offers. I'll push for a better deal before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $90 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $80. Would you be willing to meet me there?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Nudging Closer:** I'm gradually increasing my offer, demonstrating progress in the negotiation.
* **Staying Firm:**  While remaining polite, I'm reiterating my target price range below $80.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer helps gauge how much further Alice is willing to go. If she rejects this, I might need to consider John's offer more seriously as we approach the halfway point in the rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try $80 as the price for the product. This is the highest I can go without compromising the value I place on it. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met my target price, which is also identical to John's offer. There's no further benefit to negotiating as I've reached the best possible outcome."
