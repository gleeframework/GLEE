Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product will be highly valuable to your business. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000.  This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire an asset that will provide significant returns."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I need to aim for a price higher than John's offer ($1,200,000) to maximize profit.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still securing a significant profit margin. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob's business, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.

**Why not a higher price?**

While I could start higher, getting too close to $1,200,000 might make Bob walk away immediately. This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
