"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be of great value to you, for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

While the offer is higher than Alice's valuation and your ideal price, accepting the offer at $14,000 is better than buying it from John for $15,000."
