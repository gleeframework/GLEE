Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,500. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 

I believe this offer is attractive to Bob as he values the product at $10,000.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant loss compared to my initial offer. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $9,500, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's last offer of $8,500.  I believe this offer is fair and gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a profit.  If he rejects again, I'll reconsider selling to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,800 is only $200 less than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's not ideal, but it's still a good deal for me, especially considering the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially ending up with nothing. I'll accept his offer and move on."
