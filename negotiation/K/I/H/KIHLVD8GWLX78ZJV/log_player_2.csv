"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is close to my maximum but there's still room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $140 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low but reasonable:**  I'm aiming significantly lower than Alice's offer to leave room for negotiation.  $110 is still a profitable price for Alice ($10 profit), so it's not an unreasonable starting point.
* **Polite and interested:** I want to keep the negotiation friendly and signal that I'm genuinely interested in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. It's a great product and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice met me halfway between our previous offers, which is a good sign. However, there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to push a little further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You're getting closer, Alice. How about we settle for $117? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 117
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm meeting Alice halfway between her latest offer ($125) and my previous offer ($110). This shows I'm willing to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Stronger language:**  I'm using phrases like ""fair compromise"" to nudge Alice towards a deal while still being polite.
* **Nearing the limit:**  I'm getting closer to my maximum budget. If Alice rejects this offer, I may have to seriously consider John's offer to avoid overpaying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about $129? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $129. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $129
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time to close:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but her concessions are getting smaller. Further haggling might not yield much more.
* **Good price:**  $129 is a reasonable price, saving me $21 compared to John's offer. 
* **Avoiding risk:**  There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower. Accepting now secures the product at a good price."
