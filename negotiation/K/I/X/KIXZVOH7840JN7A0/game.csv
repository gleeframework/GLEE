"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you do  $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. However, I'm still looking to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would you consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'll meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",800000.0,Alice,5,
