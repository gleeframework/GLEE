"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000.  I believe this price is fair considering the value to both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to make this work, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. My final offer is $950,000.  This is a significant discount, and I'm firm on this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
