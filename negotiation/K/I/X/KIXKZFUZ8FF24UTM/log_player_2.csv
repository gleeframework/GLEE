"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are looking to pay no more than $800,000, and Alice's initial offer is significantly higher. It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

While $1,000,000 is closer to your target, it's still above your maximum. You should try to negotiate further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to make this work, but I need to be realistic about the product's worth. My final offer is $950,000.  This is a significant discount, and I'm firm on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Alice is firm on $950,000, which is still above your maximum. While you could continue negotiating, it's likely you won't be able to get her lower than that. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $800,000 and secure the product within your budget."
