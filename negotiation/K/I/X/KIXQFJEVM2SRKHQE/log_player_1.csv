Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to establish a high baseline and see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product at a price that is profitable for me. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further, but I want to make sure he understands the value I'm placing on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my initial goal of $1,000,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

I'm offering $950,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I still believe the product is worth more than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would like to get closer to $950,000, $920,000 is a good price and significantly higher than John's offer.  It's time to secure the deal and take the profit."
