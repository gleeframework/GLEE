"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  This is a fair price, and I hope you'll consider it.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $9500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you as well.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not ready to give up on the value of this product. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
