"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? This is the minimum I can accept. I think it's a fair price for a product we both value.",120.0,Alice,5,
