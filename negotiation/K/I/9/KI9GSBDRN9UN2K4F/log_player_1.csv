Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly below its true value to you. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's worth.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800000 and $875000. Can you consider $862500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still not happy with $862,500. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. However, $862,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, to $868,750. This is a good compromise, and it's the final price I'm willing to accept. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 868750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down further, but I'm still not comfortable with $868750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $862500 and $868750. Can you consider $865625? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $865,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $865,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's close enough to my minimum and it's better than selling to John for $800,000.  It's also important to consider that I'm already in round 6 and there are only 4 rounds left to close the deal.  It's unlikely I'll be able to negotiate a significantly higher price in such a short time."
