"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price reflects the true value of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which represents a significant compromise on my end. It's closer to my budget and still a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can close the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me to find a solution.  While $1,100,000 is closer to the mark, it's still below what I can accept.  I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,225,000. This is my absolute bottom line, reflecting the product's true value.  Let me know if this works for you.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
