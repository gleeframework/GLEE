"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175.  This would still give me a decent profit, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",175.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $150? This is my final offer, and it's the absolute minimum I can accept. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",150.0,Alice,5,
