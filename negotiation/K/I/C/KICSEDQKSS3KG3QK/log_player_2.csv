Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  This would give you a good price and allow me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your creative offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13500. I can do $14000, which is still a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. Let me know if you're interested.

```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $13500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so I'll do $14500. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
