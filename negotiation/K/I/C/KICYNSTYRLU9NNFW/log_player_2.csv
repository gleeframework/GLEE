"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,000 is more than he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $14,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $14,000 is my ideal price, I could be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Alice's offer of $12,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his limit than his initial offer.  While he could continue negotiating, it's likely Alice won't go lower than her ideal price of $12,000.  Accepting the offer saves time and ensures he gets the product."
