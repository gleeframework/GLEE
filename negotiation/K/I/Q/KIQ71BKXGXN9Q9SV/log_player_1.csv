Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price of $1,275,000 reflects that more accurately. What do you think?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm still committed to finding a price that works for both of us. My counteroffer is $1,225,000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is moving closer to our desired price. There's room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about $1,250,000?"",
""product_price"": 1250000

**Reasoning:** We're splitting the difference from the previous round, showing flexibility while still aiming high. This price point is a strong balance between maximizing profit and securing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given this careful consideration, Alice. I would like to propose $1,230,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate but is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting at $1,230,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer ($430,000 more) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
