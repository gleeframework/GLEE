"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,000,000. It's a significant discount from its true worth, and I'm confident it will be a lucrative investment for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I want to see if I can push Bob further. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I value your business, $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it holds for you.  I'm confident this is a win-win situation."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for your offer. I am still interested in purchasing the product, but I cannot agree to $975,000. I would like to propose $960,000 as a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $960,000 is a good compromise, and I'm concerned about losing too much time negotiating. Selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, but the risk of Bob rejecting my next offer and potentially lowering the price further is too high. I'll accept Bob's offer."
