"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. My initial offer is $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500? "", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $9,250. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's still room to negotiate further.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $8,750?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,750 is a compromise, Bob, but I still need to ensure I'm making a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I need to make sure it's a price that works for me. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, but I need to stay above $9,000. My next offer is $9,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $9,000.**  This is closer to Bob's ideal price point than John's price of $10,000.
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.**  While Bob could try to push for a lower price, it's possible that Alice might walk away, and then Bob would have to buy from John at a higher cost. 
* **Time is a factor.**  There are limited rounds left. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price below John's offer."
