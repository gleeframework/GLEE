"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair offer considering it's the maximum value for me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my price range. To be completely transparent, I'm aiming to spend closer to $1,350,000. Would you be open to that?",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,350,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,425,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. Let's reach an agreement before we run out of time.",1425000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, it seems like we are getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $1,390,000? That's a fair compromise in my opinion.",1390000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're almost there. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the closest I can go.  Let's close this deal and avoid any further delays.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
