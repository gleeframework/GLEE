Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,350,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,425,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you. Let's reach an agreement before we run out of time.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're almost there. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it's the closest I can go.  Let's close this deal and avoid any further delays.

At this point, Alice has come down significantly in price. While getting it for $1,390,000 would be ideal, the difference is minimal and risking further negotiation could result in Alice backing out or time running out. It's better to secure a good deal at $1,400,000 than potentially losing it."
