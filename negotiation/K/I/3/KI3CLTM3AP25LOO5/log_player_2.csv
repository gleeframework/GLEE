"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is significantly lower, it makes sense to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There's potential to save a substantial amount of money by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $800,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation if Alice is willing to come down further. This counteroffer establishes a starting point for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's desired price point.  There's still room to negotiate further, especially since Alice has already shown a willingness to come down. Bob should continue to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now in a better position knowing Alice is willing to negotiate.  A counteroffer of $900,000 is a reasonable middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest one. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to Bob's ideal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  $925,000 is a reasonable price considering Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Further negotiation might result in a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or having to pay the full $1,200,000 to John outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price."
