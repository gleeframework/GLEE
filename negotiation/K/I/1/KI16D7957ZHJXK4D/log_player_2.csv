"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There's room for negotiation, so it's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to maximize his savings. This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within a range that might be acceptable to Alice.  It shows Bob is serious about negotiating but also prepared to walk away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but $1,050,000 is still above Bob's ideal price. It's worth exploring if Alice will go even lower.  Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing negotiations, especially since he has the option to purchase from John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still slightly outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  If we can reach an agreement at this price, it would be a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now proposing his final offer. This is the maximum he's willing to pay, and it aligns with his option to buy from John.  This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept and close the deal, or risk losing the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,025,000, which is closer to Bob's maximum, but still above his ideal price. However, with only 5 rounds left, the negotiation is becoming a bit risky.  If Bob rejects this offer and continues negotiating, he risks Alice rejecting further counteroffers and leaving him with no deal.  

Buying from John for $1,000,000 guarantees a purchase at a price within his budget and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation.  It's a safe and reliable option, especially with limited rounds remaining."
