Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but significantly below my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a decent profit. 
* **Positive Framing:** I use a friendly and positive message to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Strategic Flexibility:** If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price downwards or potentially explore other concessions depending on his counteroffer and how much I value closing the deal. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay my minimum, I can confidently walk away from the negotiation if Bob doesn't come close to my acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close but not ideal:**  While $90 is a significant improvement from Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for better deal:** There's a chance I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation.  Bob has shown interest, and his counteroffer suggests some flexibility.
* **John as a safety net:** I'm confident that John will buy the product, so I can afford to hold out for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, appreciate the counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while staying true to my goal of maximizing profit.  
* **Slight Concessions:** I'm willing to lower my price but not too drastically. This shows flexibility while maintaining leverage.
* **Positive Tone:** I use a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer.
* **Setting a Clear Price:** I state a clear price to avoid further back-and-forth and push the negotiation closer to a conclusion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? That's the lowest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $92 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal outcome and leaves me with a smaller profit margin.
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate, wasting time and potentially leaving me with a worse outcome than selling to John.
* **Guaranteeing Profit:**  John offers a guaranteed $120, ensuring I meet my minimum requirement and avoids the risk of a lower offer or further negotiation.

**Conclusion:**  Selling to John provides the most secure and potentially the most profitable option, considering the current state of the negotiation."
