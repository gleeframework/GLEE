Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob has room to counteroffer without feeling like he's being taken advantage of.
* **It's a fair price:** Since the product is worth $150 to Bob, he's still getting a good deal. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired profit. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for a bit more, Bob's offer of $115 is closer to my minimum desired profit and still higher than what I'd get from John.  It's time to close this deal!"
