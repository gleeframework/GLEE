"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid we're quite far apart on price. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it's worth a substantial investment. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This is a very competitive offer considering the long-term benefits you'll gain.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
