"Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  While I can't go down to $12000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $13000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more breathing room.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $12500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's try to find common ground here.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, but I'm still interested in the product. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $13000?",13000.0,Bob,6,
