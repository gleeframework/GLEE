Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire an asset worth considerably more in the right hands. Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. Aiming for $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while still netting you a significant profit.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on the product's value and potential, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Clear Call to Action:** The message directly asks for Bob's decision, prompting a response. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, you automatically sell to John for $1,200,000. There's a balance between aiming high and not pushing Bob away entirely."
