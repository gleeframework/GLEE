"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. To be fair to both of us, I could let it go for $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction on my initial price, reflecting my desire to find a compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and represents a significant investment on my part. I believe it's a fair price given the current market value.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
