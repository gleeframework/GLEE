"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It makes no sense to accept it.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially get a better price.  Buying from John right away is also an option, but it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is unfortunately outside of my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value. To be fair to both of us, I could let it go for $1,800,000. This is a significant reduction on my initial price, reflecting my desire to find a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than your desired price. You can try to negotiate further and see if you can get her to come closer to your budget.  Buying from John is still a viable option if you think Alice won't budge."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and represents a significant investment on my part. I believe it's a fair price given the current market value."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
