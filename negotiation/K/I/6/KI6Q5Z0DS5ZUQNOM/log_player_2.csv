"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get the product for even less.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start a negotiation process to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I'm hoping to get a price closer to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us, considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident you'll love the product and it's a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly what Bob would pay to John. This means that there is no advantage to rejecting this offer and attempting further negotiation with Alice. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product for the lowest possible price within his budget."
