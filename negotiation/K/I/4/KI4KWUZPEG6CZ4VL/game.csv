"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a price below its worth to you, and enabling me to achieve a price closer to my desired range. I understand that you may be hesitant, but I believe this offer represents a fair compromise. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, so don't miss out on this opportunity!",1450000.0,Alice,1,
