"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value but leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Advantage:** By starting high, I create a psychological advantage. It sets the expectation of a higher price, and Bob might be more willing to negotiate down from my initial offer.
* **Leaving Room:**  This offer still allows for 5 rounds of counteroffers, giving us enough time to find a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John as a safety net:** The possibility of selling to John at $1,000,000 provides a secure fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Room for Profit:**  While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum threshold of $1,000,000. This means there's still room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially secure a better price. 
* **Leveraging John:**  The option to sell to John provides a safety net, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can reach a more favorable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($1,050,000) and my previous offer ($1,150,000).
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  This counteroffer shows that I am willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than Bob's current offer. 
* **Time is Ticking:**  By making a counteroffer, I am pushing the negotiation forward, leaving fewer rounds for Bob to further lower his price. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  This counteroffer balances the risk of losing the deal with Bob against the potential of securing a higher price than selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Falling Below Threshold:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of Further Decreases:**  There's a significant risk that Bob will continue to lower his offer in the remaining rounds, potentially leading to a deal far below my desired price.
* **Securing a Safe Outcome:** Selling to John at $1,000,000 guarantees a profit and ensures I don't lose out on a significant amount of money by further engaging in potentially unsuccessful negotiations with Bob."
