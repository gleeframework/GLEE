{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This initial offer starts high, aiming to get the best possible price.  However, I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary.  The key is to remain open to Bob's counteroffers while also knowing my bottom line is $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. I really like the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in continuing to negotiate, as I'm already at my floor. Accepting his offer ensures I get the best price possible in this scenario."
