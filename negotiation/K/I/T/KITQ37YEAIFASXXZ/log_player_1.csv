Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible from Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to entice Bob while still presenting a price that's significantly higher than his perceived value. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's guaranteed offer.
* If Bob is a tough negotiator, Alice may need to be prepared to lower the price slightly to avoid losing the sale."
