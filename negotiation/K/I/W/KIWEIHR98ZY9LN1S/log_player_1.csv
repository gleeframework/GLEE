Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement.
