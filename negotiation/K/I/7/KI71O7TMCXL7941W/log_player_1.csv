``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still being above your minimum acceptable price.  It's important to be friendly and confident, but also open to negotiation.  The ""message"" field provides an opportunity to pique Bob's interest and encourage him to consider the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Bob's offer meets my minimum price, I believe I can still get more.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price, aiming for a compromise."
