"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.  This will give me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still trying to get a good deal.  I believe $14,000 is a fair compromise and hopefully Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to his valuation, but I'm still not at my minimum. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a bit more. I have time left and John is always an option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on this one. I'm hoping that he sees the value in the product and is willing to pay a bit more to avoid losing out on the deal.  I'm getting closer to my minimum and with each round, John's offer becomes more tempting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've been through several rounds of negotiation, and while I'm getting closer to my minimum,  Bob's offers are still below that.  Time is running out, and John is offering a price that meets my minimum value. I'm going to accept John's offer to ensure I get a price that's satisfactory."
