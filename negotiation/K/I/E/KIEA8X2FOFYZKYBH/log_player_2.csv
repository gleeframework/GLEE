{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $12,000 to me, and Alice's offer of $16,000 is way too high. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $13,000. This is still above my target price of $12,000 but hopefully, it's low enough for Alice to consider."

While $14,000 is closer to my target, it's still a bit too high. I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm going to offer $12,500. This is a significant drop from Alice's last offer and hopefully, it's a price she can consider, especially since I am willing to buy from John if we can't reach an agreement."

While $13,500 is closer to my target, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12800}

I'm going to raise my offer to $12,800.  This is still a good deal for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.  Let's see if Alice will agree."
