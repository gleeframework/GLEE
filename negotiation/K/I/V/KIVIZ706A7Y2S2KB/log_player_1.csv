Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. This encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is open-ended (""What are your thoughts?""), suggesting you're willing to discuss the price further if Bob counters.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure the highest possible price from Bob.**
2. **Maintain the option of selling to John at a comfortable baseline if Bob declines.**"
