Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, knowing that the product is worth at least $80 to me. This gives me some room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Approach:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and start the negotiation. 

I'm aiming to find out how much Bob is willing to pay. If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to come down to $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $75 is below my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  
* **John is a backup:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have John as a secure alternative, ensuring I don't end up selling for less than my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $85?  That's still a great deal for such a fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by offering a price lower than my initial offer, but still higher than my minimum.
* **Highlight value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone to keep the negotiation positive. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will strike a balance between my desired price and Bob's budget, leading to a successful sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $85 is still a bit more than my budget.  Would you consider $80?  That's my absolute top limit, and it would let us both walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting the minimum:** Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No further gain:**  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a higher price. 
* **Avoiding risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate risks losing him as a buyer and potentially ending up selling to John for the same price. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at my minimum price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
