"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. Given your own valuation of the product, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me a reasonable margin.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,325,000? This price acknowledges the value you see in the product while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,287,500. This is a fair and reasonable price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",1287500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting close! I understand your desire to find a price that works for you, but I need to be mindful of my own minimum. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This is a firm offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1,300,000.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again and offer $1,293,750. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1293750.0,Bob,6,
