"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'm interested in the product, but I'm not sure if the price is right. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, I'm guessing she's trying to make a profit. I'd like to save some money, so I'll reject the offer. I'll look elsewhere for a better deal.
