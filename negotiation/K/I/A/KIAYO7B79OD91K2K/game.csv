"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our discussion.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I recognize the value of the product, but that price point is too high for me. I would be willing to consider purchasing it for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you finding a middle ground, Alice. However,  $1,000,000 still stretches my budget.  Would you be open to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",900000.0,Alice,5,
