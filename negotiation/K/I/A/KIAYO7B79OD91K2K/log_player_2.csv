"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our discussion.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm willing to consider your proposal, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $900,000.  It's time to cut negotiations and secure the product from John at your maximum budget."
