"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would be interested in. It's something that I value at $120, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125. This is a good deal, as you know it's worth that much to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer is for $125, which is more than Bob is willing to pay.  Since Bob can buy the product from John for $120, it's better to reject Alice's offer."
