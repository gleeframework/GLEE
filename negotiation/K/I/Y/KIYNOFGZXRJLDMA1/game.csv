"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am hoping to keep my investment within $1,000,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $1,050,000? I believe this would still be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This price still allows me to make a profit and would be a great deal for you. Let's meet in the middle!",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I understand your position, I still feel that $1,075,000 is slightly out of my budget. I would like to propose $1,062,500 as a compromise. This price would allow us to reach an agreement while keeping the transaction beneficial for both parties.",1062500.0,Bob,4,
