"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value ($1,500,000). This allows for room to negotiate down without jeopardizing my profit.
* **Addressing Value:**  The message highlights the product's uniqueness and potential value, trying to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open-ended Question:** The question encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and share his initial thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1500000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob's offer meets my minimum, there's still room for negotiation. I want to explore if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'll likely counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my original offer, but still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Selling to John is an option, but I'd prefer to exhaust negotiations with Bob first. If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to compromise a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $1,500,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining a Profit:**  I'm dropping my price, but still staying above my minimum. This shows flexibility without sacrificing too much.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message reinforces the product's value and emphasizes the fairness of the counteroffer.
* **Seeking Agreement:**  The question encourages Bob to reconsider and potentially agree to a price closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Decreasing Value:** Bob's offer is now significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better outcome.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 6 rounds remaining, there's not enough time to engage in prolonged negotiation.
* **Guaranteed Minimum:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum profit of $1,500,000.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's safer to secure this guaranteed sale.

It's important to note that, even though selling to John seems like the best option here, there's always a chance that Bob might make a counteroffer in the next round that is closer to my minimum. However, considering the limited rounds and Bob's declining offers, the risk of waiting is too high."
