"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its value,  $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. Let's see if we can make a deal.",800000.0,Alice,3,
