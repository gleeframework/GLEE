"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive offer of $850,000. Let's see if we can work out a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I see its value,  $850,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is at Bob's maximum budget.  Accepting the offer allows Bob to buy the product without going over his budget.  While he could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and it risks losing the deal.  Buying from John would cost the same, so this offer is the best option to secure the product within his budget."
