"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for your needs. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects the true value of this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is $5,000 over Bob's maximum value. It's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $17,000, which is still a good price for you given the product's value. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $18,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,500 is closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still $3,500 above his target.  Bob is willing to negotiate further, as he has 7 rounds remaining and the potential to get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $18,500 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking to stay within my budget.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $18,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still determined to get the product for as close to his maximum value of $15,000 as possible.  He has 5 rounds remaining and believes there's still room for negotiation.  While $18,000 is tempting, Bob is willing to risk losing the deal with Alice to try and get a better price."
