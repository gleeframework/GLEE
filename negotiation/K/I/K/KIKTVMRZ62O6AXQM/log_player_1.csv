Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're ensuring you make more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob a good incentive to accept, as he'll still be getting a deal. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have some flexibility to move closer to his price.

Remember, negotiation is a two-way street. Be prepared for Bob to counter and be willing to adjust your offer as needed."
