{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by setting a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob. It also frames the offer positively, highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $12000? That would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since Bob's offer is the minimum acceptable price for me, accepting his offer guarantees me the maximum possible profit from this deal."
