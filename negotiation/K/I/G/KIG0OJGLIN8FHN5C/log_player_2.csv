"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $180. It's too expensive, so you should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $165 out of this deal. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You are still above your maximum price point. It is worth trying to negotiate further, as you are still close to John's price and you have some time left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $165 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $140. This is a fair price for both of us, considering your profit and my budget.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not ready to go down to $140 yet. I'm willing to come down to $155, but I need to get as close to my target as possible. Can you meet me in the middle at $157.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $157.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $157.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still offering a price above your maximum budget of $120. You have several rounds left, but you risk going over your budget if you continue to negotiate.  It's best to take the safe option and buy the product from John for $120."
