Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with my ideal price, as it's the highest I'm willing to accept and still maintain my desired profit. 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Maximize potential gain:**  This is the most advantageous starting point, as it immediately shows Bob the value I place on the product.
* **Negotiation flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counter-offer. 
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects and we can't find common ground, I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring I still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:**  Bob's counteroffer is close to my ideal price, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  
* **Strategic negotiation:**  Rejecting allows me to maintain a stronger position and potentially increase the final sale price. 
* **Plan B:**  While $1,000,000 is a good deal, selling to John isn't my ideal outcome.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between my initial price ($1,000,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). It shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my value.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  It's not a drastic drop from my previous offer, demonstrating I'm still confident in the product's worth. 
* **Testing the waters:** This allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my ideal price without risking the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:**  Bob's offer is $75,000 less than my ideal price, but it's still a significant profit. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject again, there's a chance Bob will walk away entirely, or his next counteroffer will be lower.
* **Time consideration:**  Continuing to negotiate might prolong the process and potentially lead to a lower price in the end.  

Selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a good option, but accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick deal with a decent profit, minimizing risk and potential delays."
