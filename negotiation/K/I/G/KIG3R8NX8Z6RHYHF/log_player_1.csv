Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This is higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. If he rejects, I can always come down a bit, and if he accepts, I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's better than nothing, it's less than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is still higher than what Bob offered, but it's a compromise from my initial price, showing I'm willing to negotiate.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is closer to my minimum acceptable price.  While it's still a bit less than what I'd prefer, it's a reasonable compromise and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely."
