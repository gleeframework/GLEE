Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $120 to him, I'll try to get a good price for myself. I'll offer the product to Bob for $150.

{""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's making a counteroffer of $125. Since this is higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($120), I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.
