Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $19,000. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Leave John as Backup:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
