"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great value at a price of $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's offering it at $90. While it's within your budget, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see if I can meet you in the middle. How about $87.50 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down from $90 to $87.50, which is a significant concession. 
* You're comfortable paying up to $100, so this deal is still within your budget and saves you $2.50 compared to buying from John.
*  While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice won't go lower, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
