Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $13,000. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You're aware that the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. This gives you significant bargaining power.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a safety net of selling to John for $8,000, your goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $13,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit margin. This price point is likely to be enticing to Bob as he saves $2,000 compared to his own valuation."
