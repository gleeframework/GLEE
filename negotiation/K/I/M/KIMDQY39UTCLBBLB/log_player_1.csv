Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while staying above your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, increasing your potential profit. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit from Bob and ensuring a sale regardless."
