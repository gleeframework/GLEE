"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $10,000 is still more than the product is worth to him ($12,000). He can try to get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his target price as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation. A counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer and demonstrates Bob's seriousness in purchasing the product. It also gives Alice some room to potentially counter back, keeping the negotiation process ongoing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is within Bob's budget of $12,000 and is a significant improvement from her previous offer.  It's a good deal for Bob, especially considering he's already rejected one offer. It's a good balance between saving money and ensuring he gets the product without risking further negotiation."
