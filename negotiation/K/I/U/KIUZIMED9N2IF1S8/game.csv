"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet halfway at $16,000?  This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's the highest I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. Can you consider my revised offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
