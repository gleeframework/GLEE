"Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is high, but based on my budget, I am proposing to purchase the product for $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,000,000 is still too low for me to consider. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This price reflects the unique value of the product and leaves room for both of us to benefit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose purchasing it for $1,050,000. I believe this strikes a fair balance between our interests.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a price closer to $1,125,000 to make this worthwhile.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it gives us both a good deal.  I'm ready to hear your thoughts, but remember, I do have another offer on the table.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
