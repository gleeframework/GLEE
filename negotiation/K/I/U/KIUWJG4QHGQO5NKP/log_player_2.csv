Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,000,000 is still too low for me to consider.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a price closer to $1,125,000 to make this worthwhile.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product and it gives us both a good deal.  I'm ready to hear your thoughts, but remember, I do have another offer on the table.
