"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Could you do $17,000?  I'm willing to be a bit flexible if we can find a good middle ground."",
""product_price"": 17000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a little, but $17,000 is still too steep for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $13,500 is a solid deal at this point. It's significantly more than Bob initially offered and avoids the risk of him walking away later in the negotiation."
