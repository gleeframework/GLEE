"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market rate.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the product's unique value warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the product's unique value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,300,000.
