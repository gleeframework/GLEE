"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this valuable product for a price of $1,300,000.  This price reflects its significant value and potential for your business. I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. It's worth exploring if we can reach a more agreeable price, but I won't accept such a low offer.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John at a price that meets my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply too far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $1,200,000 that I know I can get from John.  I have a few more rounds, so I want to see if I can get closer to my target price before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $1,125,000.  This represents a good compromise, and it's a price that I can realistically accept. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we're getting close, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting close to a deal, but Bob is still stubbornly clinging to a price lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Given that I have the guaranteed sale to John, there's no reason to keep negotiating with Bob. The risk of further negotiations not yielding a satisfactory outcome isn't worth taking. It's time to secure the deal with John."
