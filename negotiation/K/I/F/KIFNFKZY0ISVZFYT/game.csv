"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is simply too far below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again and offer $1,125,000.  This represents a good compromise, and it's a price that I can realistically accept. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that we're getting close, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,125,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1075000.0,Bob,6,
