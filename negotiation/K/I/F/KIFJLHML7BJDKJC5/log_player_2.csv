{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $120. 
* It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. 
* $100 is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $170 but still above my maximum budget of $120, leaving room for negotiation. 
* This aggressive counteroffer will hopefully make Alice consider lowering her price."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still $10 higher than my maximum.
* I'm not yet ready to buy from John, as I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price with Alice.
*  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate by lowering her price to $130.
* I'm increasing my counteroffer to $115, which is halfway between my maximum budget of $120 and Alice's latest offer. 
* This demonstrates a genuine effort to find a compromise while still staying within my acceptable range.
* If Alice accepts, I get a decent deal. If she rejects, I'm still prepared to negotiate further."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now within my budget, but it's still $5 more than my maximum.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price significantly, showing she's serious about selling.
* My counteroffer of $120 is my absolute maximum budget, and represents a final attempt to reach a compromise.
* If Alice accepts, I get the product at my desired price. If she rejects, I'll have to buy from John.
* This is a high-stakes counteroffer, but it's worth taking a chance for a good deal."
