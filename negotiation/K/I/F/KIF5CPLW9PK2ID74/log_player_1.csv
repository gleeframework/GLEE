{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the price.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is slightly higher than what Bob considers the product to be worth. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me some room to bargain if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That way we both get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $112? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer of $112 is close enough to my minimum value of $120.  To avoid risking losing the sale and having to sell to John at a lower price, I will accept Bob's offer."
