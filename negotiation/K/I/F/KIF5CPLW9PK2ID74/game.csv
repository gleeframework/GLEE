,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That way we both get a good deal.  What do you say?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $112? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",112.0,Bob,4,
