"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it.  What do you think?",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $18000 for it. Can you consider that?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident I can find a similar product for $15000 elsewhere.  Would you be willing to consider $16500 as a final offer?  I'm ready to make a decision quickly.",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but I'm not going any lower than that. It's a fair price considering the product's value and what I need to make on it. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $17000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm very close to pulling the trigger on a similar product from another seller, but I'm really drawn to what you're offering.  If you could come down to $16000, I'd be happy to finalize the purchase right now.  What do you say?",16000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really torn between this product and the other one, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll meet you at $16500, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,7,
