Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very valuable product that I believe would be of significant interest to you. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it. It's a one-time opportunity and I believe it's well worth the investment. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. $1,200,000 is still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would allow both of us to benefit from this opportunity. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to go up to $1250000, but that's my maximum. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe there's room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000 as a final concession. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I truly believe this product will be worth every penny to you.  Is this something you can work with?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1250000, which would be $1225000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Although the offer is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a higher price. I will reject and try to increase the offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $1,225,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $1,275,000, which is a significant compromise for me. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal work. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to pay $1275000. I'm willing to go up to $1225000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm running out of time to get a better deal from Bob. Although I'd prefer to get more than $1,000,000, it's better to secure a sale than risk losing out entirely."
