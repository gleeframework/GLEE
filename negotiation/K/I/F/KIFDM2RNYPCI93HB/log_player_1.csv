Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a good price, it's still below the value I'd like to get for the product. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation while being closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $9,500 is still a good deal. It's well above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 and closer to the middle ground. There's a risk that if I continue to negotiate, Bob might back out or further lower his offer.  Therefore, accepting his offer seems like the best option at this point."
