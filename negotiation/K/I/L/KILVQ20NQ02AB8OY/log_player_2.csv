"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's budget.  Bob should reject the offer and counter-offer to try and get a lower price.  Bob has a safety net with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept a high price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  I'm confident you'll see the immense value at this price point.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price. There's still potential to save money, and he has the fallback option of buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $900,000 for the product.  This represents a significant investment on my part and would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to consider a final offer of $950,000. This is a significant price reduction on my end and reflects my desire to reach a deal. I believe this price offers a fair balance between value and investment.  Let me know if this works for you.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still a bit higher. Bob should reject the offer and counter-offer again to see if he can push Alice down to his target price of $900,000. He has a fallback option with John, so he can afford to be a bit more persistent."
