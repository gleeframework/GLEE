Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I'm looking to get $175 for it.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts high, recognizing that Bob is only willing to pay $100. It leaves room for negotiation while still setting a good starting point for maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I am interested but I can only pay up to $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would ideally prefer more than $150, accepting Bob's offer is the best option in this situation.  This is because:

* **My minimum threshold:** My minimum is $150, and Bob's offer meets this.
* **John's offer:** John is also offering $150. There is no benefit to waiting for a counteroffer or going to John, as both options will result in the same profit. 
* **Maximizing profit:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me the best possible outcome given my options."
