"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will bring you a lot of value. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $13,500.",13500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm prepared to offer $12,500 for the product, considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I believe the product's value to you is worth it, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's work together to find a middle ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll meet you at $13,500, which is closer to my minimum price, but still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the sale.",13500.0,Alice,5,
