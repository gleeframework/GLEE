"Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $90 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $70 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we meet at $85? It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product offers.",85.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! However, I still think the product is worth a bit more. How about we meet at $82.50? It's a good compromise, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",82.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, $80 is about as high as I can go.  Would you be willing to accept that?",80.0,Bob,6,
