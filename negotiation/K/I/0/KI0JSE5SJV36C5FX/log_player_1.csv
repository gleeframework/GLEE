Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at the maximum price I know Bob is willing to pay. This sets a strong initial position and allows for potential negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's value to both of us establishes common ground and can make Bob more open to negotiation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves the door open for Bob to counteroffer.  

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is a strategic starting point.  I will monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly:

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've maximized my earnings.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to:
    * **Accept:** If the price is close enough to my target.
    * **Counteroffer:** If I believe I can push the price higher.
    * **Reject and sell to John:** If Bob's offer is too low, I'm willing to walk away and guarantee my minimum earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider selling the product to me for $950000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $950,000 is lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to accept and get the deal done, I believe I can still push for a better price.  I'm confident in the product's value and know that Bob is motivated to acquire it. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired $1,000,000.  I'll need to carefully consider how much I'm willing to budge while still ensuring a profitable outcome."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'd need to see a price closer to $975,000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing a price of $975,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate while still remaining firm on my bottom line.
* **Positive Tone:**  My message emphasizes finding a solution that works for both of us. This keeps the negotiation amicable and avoids creating a hostile environment.
* **Confidence:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product to subtly remind Bob that he's getting a great deal at this price. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer represents a strategic compromise. I'm testing the waters to see if Bob is truly willing to pay close to my initial asking price. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've secured a profitable sale.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counteroffer again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me, I would like to propose a price of $960000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my desired price of $975,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price of $1,000,000, accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and secure a significant profit. 

**Considerations:**

* **Time:** Continuing the negotiation could drag on and might lead to a stalemate.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out for a higher price might mean losing the deal altogether and having to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Risk:** While a higher price is desirable, there's a risk that Bob might walk away altogether.

**Decision:**

Given the factors above, accepting Bob's offer is the most prudent decision at this time.  It allows me to secure a significant profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
