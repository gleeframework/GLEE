"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $170. Let me know what you think.",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is significantly below what I need to sell this product.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $120?  I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $120 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we try $75? That's a pretty fair offer considering your initial price and my budget.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $75 simply wouldn't cover my costs.  Let's try $100.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $100 is closer, it's still a bit above what I had in mind. How about we settle at $80? That's my final offer. ",80.0,Bob,6,
