"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is far too low.  I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly exceptional and worth a significant investment.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value I know you'll receive.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. That feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $700,000 is still a bit too far from what this product is worth.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This allows us both to make a good deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this investment.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's still significantly above your alternative option of buying from John for $800,000. There's no guarantee Alice will go below $800,000, so it's in your best interest to secure the product at the guaranteed lower price."
