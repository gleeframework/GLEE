"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this first offer. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how willing he is to pay. I'm confident I can get a good price, but I'm also open to walking away and selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm confident I can get a better price, so I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is far too low.  I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly exceptional and worth a significant investment.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value I know you'll receive.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. That feels like a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still too low. I'm going to reject it and see if I can push him closer to my desired price.  I'm not quite ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $700,000 is still a bit too far from what this product is worth.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  This allows us both to make a good deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this investment. "", ""product_price"": 850000}
