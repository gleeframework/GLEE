Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm aware that Bob might counteroffer, so I'm leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm keeping in mind that I have a fallback option in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize my earnings, and $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation:** I believe there is room for further negotiation with Bob.  His counteroffer is closer to my desired price than his initial valuation of $12,000. 
* **John as Leverage:** The fact that I have a guaranteed buyer in John at $15,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. This is a fair price, considering the value this product offers.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price slightly from the previous round.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Openness:** I'm ending with an open-ended statement to encourage continued negotiation.
* **John as Backstop:** I'm still mindful of my ability to sell to John for $15,000, which gives me confidence in my negotiation position.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground while maintaining a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $13,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $13,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation could take time and effort without a guarantee of a significantly better outcome.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed profit and eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob.

While I'm close to reaching an agreement with Bob, the guaranteed sale to John for a higher price makes it the most financially prudent decision at this point."
