I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,300,000. This is a good starting point as it's above my minimum price but leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a good price, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiations don't go my way."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm happy to negotiate, I won't settle for a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,250,000. This is still a good price for both of us, and hopefully, we can reach an agreement."
