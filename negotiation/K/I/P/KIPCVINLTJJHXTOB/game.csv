"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm trying to stay within a certain budget.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're working within a budget, Bob, but $10,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go.",11500.0,Bob,4,
