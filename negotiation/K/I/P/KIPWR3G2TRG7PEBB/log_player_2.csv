"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  $120 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $150.  He should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $100.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $115 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget:**  $115 is less than Bob's maximum of $150. 
* **It's a good deal for Bob:** While he would prefer $100,  $115 is a significant improvement from the initial $120. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee that Alice will go lower, and Bob risks ending up paying $150 to John if he continues to reject offers."
