"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about $10500?  That's a fair price considering the value to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal, I can likely get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to meet you halfway.  This still gives you a good deal considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11000 is still a little out of my range.  How about $10750?  That's a good compromise, and it's closer to where I need to be. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  I'm still holding out for a higher price, and I believe I can get it. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  But $10,750 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,875? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  How about $10800?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $10,800.  While I would have liked to get closer to my initial asking price, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and it's better to secure the deal now."
