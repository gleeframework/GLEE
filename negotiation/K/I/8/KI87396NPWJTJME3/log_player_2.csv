"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's limit of $8,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob needs to start low to signal his seriousness about getting a good deal.  $8,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's offer, but still a reasonable starting point for negotiation.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  A $8,500 offer leaves room for some give and take in the subsequent rounds.  
* **Be Polite:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone can help build rapport and increase the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $10000?  It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a profit.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice has come down from her initial price, $10,000 is still above Bob's limit of $8,000. 
* **Potential for Further Reduction:** Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, indicating further reductions might be possible. 
* **Opportunity to Save:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open, providing a chance for Bob to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in your product, and I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to get what I need while giving you a good price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** Bob is gradually increasing his offer, demonstrating his seriousness without going too high too quickly.
* **Fairness Focus:**  Bob emphasizes the fairness of his offer for both parties, making it more appealing to Alice.
* **Staying Within Budget:**  $9,000 is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here. Let's meet in the middle at $9500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  $9,500 is still above Bob's limit of $8,000. While it's closer, there's still room for negotiation to reach a more favorable price.
* **Negotiation Momentum:**  Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, suggesting that a deal closer to Bob's price may be possible.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation alive and allows Bob to try and push for a lower price.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  If Bob accepts now, he's only saving $500 compared to buying from John. Continuing the negotiation could potentially yield a better deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm very close to my limit, but I can offer $9,250.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:**  Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on Finality:**  He emphasizes the desire to finalize the deal, signaling that this might be his last offer.
* **Staying Within Budget:**  $9,250 is still within Bob's budget, but it's pushing his limit. This helps create a sense of urgency for Alice."
