Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000} 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but I'm open to negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds before considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm not satisfied with that. I'll try to get closer to my initial asking price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm going to try and split the difference between my initial asking price and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is only $1,000 less than my initial offer, and I'm confident I won't be able to negotiate any higher.  It's better to take the $16,000 than to risk getting nothing or having to sell to John for $15,000."
