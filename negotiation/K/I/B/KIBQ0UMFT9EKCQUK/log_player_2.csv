"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its potential for your business, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. My starting price is $1,200,000. This reflects the value I place on the product while still leaving room for negotiation. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you seeing the value of this product, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect its true potential.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still committed to finding a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm willing to drop to $950,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I'm hoping it demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement. Let's close this deal and get you the product you need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement you've made. To be completely transparent, I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you be willing to consider $925,000?  I think that's a very fair offer, and it would allow me to get this deal done today."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I want to make this deal work. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $937,500 for the product.  This is my final offer.  If you're serious about acquiring this valuable product, I believe this is a fair and reasonable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has signaled this is her final offer. While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, the difference is getting smaller and there's a risk Alice will hold firm. Accepting at $937,500 secures a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price."
