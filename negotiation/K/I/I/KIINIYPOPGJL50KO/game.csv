"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I can meet you in the middle at $17,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $17,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. Would you consider $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $17,500 and $12,500, so I'll offer it to you for $15,000. This is the minimum I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",15000.0,Alice,5,
