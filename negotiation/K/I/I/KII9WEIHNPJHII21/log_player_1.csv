Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth at least $12,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offering $10,000:** This is a good starting point. It's lower than your minimum but still higher than Bob's valuation. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Message:**  A friendly and open message encourages Bob to respond positively. 
* **No Hard Deadline:**  This allows for flexibility. If Bob counters, you have the option to negotiate further. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! You've made a profit.
* If Bob rejects, analyze his counteroffer. If it's within your acceptable range, consider accepting.
* If Bob's counteroffer is too low, counter with a price closer to $10,000. 
* If the negotiations stall or become frustrating, you can always walk away and sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,500 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counter-offer and try to secure a price closer to your desired range.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counter-Offer:** You'll need to send a counter-offer to Bob. Aim for a price that is still above your minimum but more appealing to Bob than his current offer.  
* **Consider Your Risk:** Remember, John is willing to pay $12,000, so you have a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counter-offer splits the difference between your previous offer ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This shows that you're willing to negotiate but not at a significant loss.
* **Positive and Persuasive:** The message emphasizes fairness and a win-win situation.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $9,250 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Decision:**  Wait for Bob's response to your counteroffer.
* **Potential Acceptance:** If Bob accepts, you've secured a sale at a price that's closer to your desired range.
* **Another Counter-Offer:**  If Bob rejects, you'll need to analyze his next offer and decide whether to counter again or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,250. I'm willing to go to $9,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to Target:**  $9,000 is relatively close to your desired price range, especially considering Bob is unlikely to go much higher.  
* **Potential for More Negotiation:** While $9,000 is below your minimum,  it's not a huge loss and you can always try to negotiate further with Bob in the future if you need to sell the product at a higher price. 
* **Time and Effort:** Accepting this offer allows you to avoid further negotiations and potentially save time and energy. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept the Offer:**  Confirm your acceptance to Bob and finalize the sale.
* **Future Negotiations:** Keep in mind that even after selling the product, you can continue to build a relationship with Bob and potentially negotiate higher prices in the future."
