"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, you're still trying to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer is the best strategy to see if you can get closer to your target price."
