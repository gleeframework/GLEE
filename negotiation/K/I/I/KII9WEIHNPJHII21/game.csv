"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",9250.0,Alice,3,
