"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm going to counteroffer at $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value of the product to both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but $1,150,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm going to counteroffer at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's the highest I'm willing to go.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
