Alice's offer:

I'm willing to go down to $850,000,  which is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll be accepting another offer for the product.

Alice is holding firm at a price that's not advantageous for me. It's clear she's not going to budge much further. Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option now to stay within my budget."
