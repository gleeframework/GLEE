Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for room to negotiate while still ensuring a significant profit.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob. It also establishes a clear starting point for the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely observe Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it or make a new counteroffer. However, I will always keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option, ensuring I never settle for a price below my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation:** While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's initial counteroffer is too low to even consider.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price, while still leaving room for some negotiation. I'll continue to evaluate each offer against John's offer, ensuring I never settle for a price below my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and my own expenses, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer and closer to his perceived value. This demonstrates flexibility while still ensuring a profitable deal for me.
* **Message:** My message maintains a friendly tone, acknowledging Bob's offer while firmly stating my position.  It emphasizes the benefits of the proposed price for both parties, encouraging further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I will decide whether to make another counteroffer or simply accept John's offer of $1,200,000. I will continuously evaluate my options, prioritizing a profitable outcome while staying open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $750,000 is an improvement, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which is considerably higher than Bob's current offer.
* **Negotiation:** At this point, I'm not confident that further negotiation with Bob will lead to a price that meets my minimum requirements. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a final counteroffer, closer to my desired price, but if Bob rejects it, I will accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,200,000. I want to maximize my profit, and John's offer ensures that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000,  which is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll be accepting another offer for the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer of $850,000 is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but it's still significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while ensuring a profitable outcome.
* **Finality:** My message clearly states that this is my final offer. This creates a sense of urgency for Bob and potentially encourages him to accept.
* **John's Offer:** I'm reminding Bob that I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, which reinforces my commitment to maximizing my profit.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I will immediately accept John's offer and sell the product to him. This is my last attempt to negotiate with Bob, and I'm not willing to go lower than my counteroffer price."
