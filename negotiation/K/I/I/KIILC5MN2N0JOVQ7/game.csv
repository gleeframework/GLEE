"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and my own expenses, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value you place on the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? This would be a mutually beneficial deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to go down to $850,000,  which is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll be accepting another offer for the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
