Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I need to make a profit, and $800000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $950,000, which is still above your budget. You've already made two counteroffers, and it seems like she's unwilling to go lower than $950,000.  To save money and avoid further negotiation, it's best to buy the product from John for $800,000."
