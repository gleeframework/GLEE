Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it slightly below this at $925,000 allows for a significant profit margin while still being very appealing to Bob.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""one-time offer"" are designed to encourage Bob to act quickly and prevent him from countering with a lower offer. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" reminds Bob that you have alternatives if he rejects your offer, even though you haven't disclosed the exact details of your deal with John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
