Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short of that price. How about we try $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to a price I'm happy with. I'm willing to push a little further to see if I can get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  How about we split the difference and settle at $96?"",
""product_price"": 96
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $94. Can we meet there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $94
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, Bob is very close to my desired price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether. Accepting $94 is a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
