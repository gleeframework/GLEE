"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's still a fair price for a product worth $100 to you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $85 might be a bit too low for you, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. Would you be willing to meet me at $87.50? I'm willing to compromise and make a deal with you.",87.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $87.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $88.75. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",88.75,Alice,5,
