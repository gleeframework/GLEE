Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $22,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 22000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential"" without explicitly stating what that value is. This creates a sense of desirability and allows Bob to potentially justify the high price in his own mind.
* **Gauging interest:** This offer serves as a way to gauge Bob's interest. If he outright rejects this high price, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John. If he counters, it indicates he's interested, and you can begin negotiating closer to your minimum."
