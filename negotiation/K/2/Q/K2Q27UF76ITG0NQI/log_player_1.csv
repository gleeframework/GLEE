Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and while I could sell to John for $8,000, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $7,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
