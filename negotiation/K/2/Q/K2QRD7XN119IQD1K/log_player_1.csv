Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he haggles you down. 
* **Anchoring:** By suggesting $120, I'm ""anchoring"" the price in Bob's mind. Even though it's higher than his perceived value, it sets a reference point that might make a lower counter-offer from him (but still above $80) seem more reasonable.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer."
