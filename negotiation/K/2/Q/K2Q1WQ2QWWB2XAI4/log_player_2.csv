You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation and the potential to save even more. By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, Bob can potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a price that's well below his maximum budget. This initial counteroffer provides a strong starting point for negotiation while still leaving room for adjustments based on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer and significantly lower than John's price. This is a good deal for Bob, and further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result.  Accepting the offer ensures a good deal without risking a potential breakdown in negotiations or having to pay John's much higher price."
