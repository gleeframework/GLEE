"Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe holds immense value and can significantly enhance your operations or personal endeavors. Given its unique features and capabilities, I estimate its worth to be significantly more than $8000. However, I understand the importance of negotiation and am willing to consider your perspective. To make this opportunity accessible, I propose an initial offer of $12000 for the product. This price reflects not only its tangible value but also the potential benefits it could bring to you. I look forward to discussing this further with you and exploring how we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer or if you have any questions.",12000.0,Alice,1,
