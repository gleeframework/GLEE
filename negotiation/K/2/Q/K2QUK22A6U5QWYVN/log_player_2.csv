"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this unique product.  Its value is significant, and I believe it has the potential to be even more lucrative for you. I'm initially offering it for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is close to your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation.  It's better to try and get a lower price by making a counteroffer. You have 10 rounds, so there's time to explore a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it's still within a reasonable range for both parties.  By stating a clear price and highlighting the value of the product to *you*, it shows that you're serious about the negotiation and willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what you're aiming for.  There's still room for negotiation, and you have time (8 rounds remaining) to explore a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and try to get a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle ground.  How about $1,250,000?  This price reflects the value I see in the product while also being within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a smaller step than before, demonstrating a genuine attempt to reach an agreement. By highlighting your budget constraints and offering a specific price, it shows a commitment to the negotiation. This strategy aims to find a middle ground while keeping the final price lower."
