* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While you'd save $1,000 by going with Alice, it's still within your budget and a good deal. 
* **The product's value to you:** The product is worth $15,000 to you, so even at $14,000 you're getting a good deal. 
* **Limited-time offer:** While this might be a tactic, it adds urgency and suggests you might miss out on the deal."
