"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I know is worth at least $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for a price that's extremely fair, considering its value to you. I'm asking for $1,000,001. This is a chance to acquire something truly valuable at a very reasonable price. What do you say?",1000001.0,Alice,1,
