I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While $87 is a decent price, I'm going to continue to negotiate with Bob. I'm hoping I can squeeze out a few more dollars before I have to resort to selling to John.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
