{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $12,000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation, considering the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. I'm aiming to find a price that is agreeable to both of us, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit too high for me right now. How about $10000?  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is a good price, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still looking for a bit more. Let's split the difference and go with $11,000.  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
