Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer. Offering a price too close to $1,500,000 leaves little room for Bob to see value.  Offering a price too low might insult him.  Finding the right balance is key.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects its significant potential to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It positions the product's value to Bob, not just its price. 
* **The Price:** $1,350,000 gives Bob a $150,000 gain if he accepts, while you secure a $150,000 profit above your minimum. This split incentivizes both parties.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Have a strategy for how high you're willing to go.
* **Relationship:**  While maximizing profit is important, consider the long-term implications for your relationship with Bob, especially if you might do business again in the future."
