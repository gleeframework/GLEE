"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you at $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm highlighting the potential value the product offers Bob. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get as close to my minimum value ($12,000) as possible.  By starting high, I can create some wiggle room for negotiation while still having a good chance of making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation, as Bob is clearly interested in the product. 
* **Strategic Counter-Offer:**  I'll use the next round to make a counter-offer, aiming to reach a price closer to my minimum.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also maintaining my desired profit margin. I'll strategically counter-offer to try to bridge the gap between our valuations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  $6,000 is a bit too far below what I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? This price still allows you a good deal while ensuring I can cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. This shows my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers, highlighting that $8,000 is still a good deal for him.
* **Direct Approach:** I'm being direct and clear about my counter-offer,  leaving no room for misinterpretation.

**Strategy:**

I believe $8,000 is a reasonable price that balances my minimum value with Bob's willingness to negotiate.  I'm aiming to close the deal in this round, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
