Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob allows me to potentially maximize my profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 is strategically placed:
    * It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000), giving me room for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
    * It offers Bob a potential profit of $150,000 ($1,150,000 offer price - $1,000,000 value to Bob), incentivizing him to accept. 
* **Backup Option:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on selling to John at my desired price."
