"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential while still being fair to both of us. Let's discuss further, and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $1,000,000
* **Your maximum budget:** $1,200,000
* **John's price:** $1,200,000

You can save $200,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John. Even though John's price is your maximum, it's still better than paying $1,000,000 to Alice."
