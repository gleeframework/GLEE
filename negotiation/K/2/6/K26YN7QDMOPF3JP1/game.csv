"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I'm sure you'll find extremely valuable. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a product that's worth $1,200,000 to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to counter with a price of $1,050,000. This reflects the value I place on it and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
