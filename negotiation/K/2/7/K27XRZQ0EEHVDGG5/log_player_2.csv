"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Since Bob's maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice is offering the product for $15,000, it's logical to immediately buy from John for the same price. There's no potential to save money by negotiating with Alice."
