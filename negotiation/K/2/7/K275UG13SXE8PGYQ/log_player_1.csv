"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I have room to lower the price if Bob counters, but I want to see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired price first.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the value of the product to make the offer more enticing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm only willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, $10,000 is still significantly below my ideal price.
* **Opportunity to negotiate further:** I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price if I continue negotiating.
* **Avoiding a loss:** Selling to John for $15,000 would be a much better deal than accepting Bob's current offer.

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum but still leaving some room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're interested but $10,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500, which is a significant discount. It's a fair price for a product worth much more, and it gives you a great deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price.
