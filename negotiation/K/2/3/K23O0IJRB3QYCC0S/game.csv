"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $950,000 is a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000. I believe that's a fair starting point for us to negotiate from.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to counteroffer at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is still a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  This gets us closer to a deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. I'd like to counteroffer at $825,000. This is a slight concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
