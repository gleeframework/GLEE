"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and the potential benefits it offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately below my minimum selling price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,150,000. This reflects the significant value this product offers and allows you a substantial return on your investment.  Let's try to find common ground here.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,050,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. Let's make a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
