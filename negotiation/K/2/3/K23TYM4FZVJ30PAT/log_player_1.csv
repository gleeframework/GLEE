Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me, leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will see value in the product and might be willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price and I don't want to risk losing the sale by rejecting it. I can always try to get a better price from John in the future."
