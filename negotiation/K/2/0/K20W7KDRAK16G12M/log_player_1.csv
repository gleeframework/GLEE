Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $1,100,000 at this time.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on it.

This is the absolute highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value we both place on the product.
