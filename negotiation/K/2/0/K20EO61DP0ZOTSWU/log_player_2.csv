"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe will greatly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 Bob should reject the offer.  $1,400,000 is still too high, and he has 10 rounds to negotiate a better price.  It's possible to get a lower price from Alice and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000.  This is a fair price that considers the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I understand your perspective. After considering the value this product brings, I believe a price closer to $1,350,000 is more reflective of its worth. This still offers you a significant gain while recognizing the unique nature of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than the initial offer, $1,350,000 is still too high compared to his goal of saving as much money as possible.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,350,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and leaves room for us both to be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This recognizes the value you see in the product while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should continue to negotiate. $1,300,000 is still too high for him, and he has several more rounds to try and get a better price. He's already shown he's willing to pay a fair price, and Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate. It's likely he can get a price closer to his desired goal with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still above what I can afford right now. I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,275,000. This would be a good compromise and allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
