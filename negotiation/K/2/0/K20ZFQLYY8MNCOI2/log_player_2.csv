Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,800. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. Accepting this offer means saving $1,200 compared to buying from John, which is a significant saving. It is also a good price for Bob, as he still gets the product for under his budget."
