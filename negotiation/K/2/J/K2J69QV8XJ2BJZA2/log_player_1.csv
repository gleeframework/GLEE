"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.  I'll see how Bob responds before making any further decisions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $90. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counteroffering with $95. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaving some room for profit.  It's likely Bob will either accept this or counteroffer again, giving me more information to decide my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $92. While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, we're already 4 rounds in, and with John offering $80, it's becoming more likely that Bob will continue to lower his offer.  $92 is a solid profit, and it's worth locking in this deal to avoid risking losing out to John."
