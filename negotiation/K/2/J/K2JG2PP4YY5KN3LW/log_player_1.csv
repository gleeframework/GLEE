Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below his maximum ($925,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **High Anchor Price:**  This initial high price sets the stage and makes Bob more receptive to a final price that's still very favorable to you.

This strategy aims to secure a deal with Bob at a price significantly higher than your backup offer from John."
