"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can still purchase the product, albeit at a higher price, but still within his budget."
