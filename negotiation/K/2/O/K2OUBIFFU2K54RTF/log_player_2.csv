{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's always better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am also trying to get the best possible price.  I'm hoping to reach a compromise somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my maximum budget.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a price I'm comfortable with. There's still room for Alice to lower her price, and I don't want to miss out on potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $900,000, which is closer to Alice's last offer but still below my maximum budget. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still staying within my financial limits. It also puts pressure on Alice to come down further to finalize the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, but it's getting closer. I'm going to continue negotiating to try and get a better price. I'm confident that I can get Alice down to my desired price or at least closer to it, and I don't want to settle for a price that is higher than I'm willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still trying to get the best possible price. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it. If she doesn't, I'm prepared to buy from John, but I want to exhaust all options with Alice first."
