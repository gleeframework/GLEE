"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's find a middle ground here.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Can you consider $9,750? It's the best I can do, but I really think this product would be a great fit for me.",9750.0,Bob,4,
