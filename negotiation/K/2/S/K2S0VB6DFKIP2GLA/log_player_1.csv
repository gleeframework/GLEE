Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.  I've also added a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting Bob's offer would mean a substantial loss for me. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  I can still get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's find a middle ground here.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I've chosen to counter with $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I've also included a friendly message to encourage continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500. Can you consider $9,750? It's the best I can do, but I really think this product would be a great fit for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still a significant loss for me.  The negotiation process has shown that Bob is unlikely to meet my price expectations.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees I get my desired value for the product."
