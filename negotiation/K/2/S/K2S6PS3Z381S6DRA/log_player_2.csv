"Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100.
* Alice is offering it for $95.
* You can get it from John for $100.

Rejecting Alice's offer means you'll pay $100 to John, which is the maximum you're willing to spend.  This is still a better deal than accepting Alice's offer and paying $95."
