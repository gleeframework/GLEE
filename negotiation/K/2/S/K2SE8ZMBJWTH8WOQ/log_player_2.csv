"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since your maximum budget is $120, and John is willing to sell the product for that price, it makes no sense to negotiate with Alice. You can get the product for the same price immediately from John."
