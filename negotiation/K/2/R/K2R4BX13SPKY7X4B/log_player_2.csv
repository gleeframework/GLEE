# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.

Bob should reject the offer. $90 is still more than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get it for a bit less. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $92. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $92 is closer to his desired price, it's still above his personal value of $80 and above his limit of $120. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise again. I can offer it to you for $95, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's still a great value, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $95 is still above Bob's personal value of $80 and close to his limit of $120. It's better to avoid further negotiation and buy from John for a price he's already comfortable with."
