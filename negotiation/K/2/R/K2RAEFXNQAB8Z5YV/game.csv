"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle on $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but $1,100,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,200,000. This is my final offer on this price point.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
