Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth at least $12,000 in the current market, but I'm willing to part with it for $11,500. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but still entice Bob to buy. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning a limited-time offer and the possibility of listing it publicly, Alice encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $11,500, there might be a slight wiggle room for negotiation if Bob counters. However, Alice knows she has John as a backup buyer."
