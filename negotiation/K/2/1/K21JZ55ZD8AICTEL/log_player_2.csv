"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm looking for $14,000 for it. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within his budget, it's still higher than Alice's value of $12,000. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reasonable Counteroffer:** This price is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for Alice.
* **Strategic Message:** The message expresses interest but highlights that the offer is too high. This sets a positive tone while establishing a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $13,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13,500. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $13,500 is a reasonable price for Bob. It's within his budget and significantly lower than John's offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice's offer shows a willingness to compromise, making it a fair deal for both parties. 
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, accepting the offer secures the product while avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal."
