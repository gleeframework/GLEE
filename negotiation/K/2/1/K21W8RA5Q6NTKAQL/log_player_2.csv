{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget. You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's price, aiming to see if there's room for negotiation. This will also gauge Alice's seriousness about selling at a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  I'll try to negotiate further.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down a bit more, especially since she's already rejected my counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $1,150,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about purchasing, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my budget.  This amount is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current offer."
