Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me some room to negotiate. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good deal without having to go through a lengthy negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not sure if further negotiation will yield a better result. Given that John is willing to pay $1,200,000, I'll choose to sell to John and secure a guaranteed profit."
