"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but  $1,150,000 is a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,075,000 is a good profit, I'm still aiming for a higher price since I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000. I'll provide a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to move a bit from my initial price, how about $1,125,000? This reflects the true value of the product."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we are making progress. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. I believe that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

We're getting close, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly willing to go above $1,100,000, and I want to aim for a price closer to his perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. I'm happy to continue this negotiation, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth. How about we settle at $1,115,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close! I'm willing to come up slightly. How about $1,105,000? I believe this is a competitive offer and represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,105,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,105,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and the difference at this point is relatively small. Accepting $1,105,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
