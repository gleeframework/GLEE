Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **My Minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $8,000 (John's offer).
* **Negotiation:** I'm offering a price significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaving room for Bob to make a profit. This should incentivize him to accept.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while still maintaining a good chance of Bob accepting the offer."
