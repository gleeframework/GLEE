"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. There's room to negotiate downwards towards a price that's more beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. The price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still a good margin above her value of $80. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Conversational:**  Maintaining a friendly and respectful tone helps foster a more agreeable negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is too low for me. How about $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate.  We're aiming for something closer to $95, and it's unlikely she'll accept that outright. Another counteroffer keeps the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle in the middle at $97?"",
""product_price"": 97
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting $97, we're splitting the difference between our last offer ($90) and her counteroffer ($105). This tactic often feels fair to both parties and can help close the deal. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  While still polite, we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency to move the negotiation towards a close.  Alice might be more inclined to accept a price closer to her minimum if she senses the deal might slip away."
