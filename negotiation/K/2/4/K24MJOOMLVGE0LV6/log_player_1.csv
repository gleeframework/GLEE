Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it presents a unique value proposition and am confident it will be highly beneficial for you."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum price ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential counter-offers from Bob. He might try to negotiate a lower price, and we can always come down slightly while still remaining above our minimum.
* **Strong but Polite Language:** The message aims to be persuasive without being overly aggressive. Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" emphasizes the potential benefits to Bob. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject this offer. However, since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, we can afford to aim higher with Bob initially."
