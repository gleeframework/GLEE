Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for the product. This is a significant discount, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product.
