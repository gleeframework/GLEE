"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. My initial offer for the product is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better price by counter-offering. He has a clear goal to save as much money as possible, and buying from John immediately would be a worse deal than continuing negotiations with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer. However, I'm hoping to get a better price. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant discount, but I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking that $1000000 is a bit too low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1350000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still potentially get a better price than $1,350,000.  While Alice has moved closer to his desired price, it's still above his target.  It's better to continue negotiating with Alice, as buying from John would be a worse deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1150000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. My counteroffer is $1275000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's not his ideal price, it's significantly lower than buying from John.  He has already rejected two counteroffers, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise. At this point, continuing to negotiate risks Alice walking away or reaching an impasse,  making accepting the current offer the most logical choice."
