"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for the product. Let me know if this is within your range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to push a bit more to see if I can get a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but I need to be firm on the value of this product.  My final offer is $1,090,000. This is a very competitive price for something of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1090000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm drawing a line in the sand with this offer. It's a strong compromise, leaving a significant gap for Bob to profit while still getting me closer to my target. If he rejects this, the risk of losing the deal to John becomes more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $1,080,000 for the product. This is the highest I can go without exceeding my budget.

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go higher, and this offer exceeds my fallback option of selling to John. It's time to close the deal."
