# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is truly exceptional and offers unparalleled value. Given its quality and the benefits it provides, I believe we can come to an agreement that is mutually beneficial. I am offering this exclusive opportunity to you for $120. I understand that value is subjective, but I assure you that this product exceeds expectations and will provide significant returns on your investment. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further or if there's any way I can make this offer more appealing to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your maximum value for the product is $120, and Alice is offering it at that price, there's no benefit in rejecting the offer. Buying from John would cost the same, so accepting Alice's offer is the best choice in this scenario."
