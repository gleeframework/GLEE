"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product at a price of $12,500. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable item at a discounted rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Buying from Alice for $12,500 saves you $2,500 compared to buying from John.
* **You're within your budget:** The offer is below your $15,000 limit. 

It makes sense to accept Alice's offer to save money."
