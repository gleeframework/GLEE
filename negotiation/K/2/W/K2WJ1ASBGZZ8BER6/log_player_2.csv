Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?
