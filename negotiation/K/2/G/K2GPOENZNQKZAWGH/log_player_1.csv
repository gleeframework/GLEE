"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for it, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $2,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm feeling comfortable at $1,800,000.  This price allows us both to make a reasonable profit.  Let's try to close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

We're getting closer, but I still think there's room for negotiation.  I'm not ready to go that low just yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're getting close, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm going to stick with my last offer of $1,800,000. This price allows for a good profit for both of us, and it's the maximum I can afford. I hope we can reach an agreement at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a good deal. It provides a significant profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing him as a buyer by pushing too hard."
