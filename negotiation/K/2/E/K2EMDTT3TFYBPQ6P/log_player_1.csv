I'm starting with an offer of $17,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me with a profit above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $16,500. This is a slight compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me with some profit.  I'm hoping this will be enough to persuade Bob to accept."

I've decided to sell the product to John.  Bob has shown he's not willing to negotiate further and I'm comfortable with the $15,000 offer from John.  It's time to move on."
