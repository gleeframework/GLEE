"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $18,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his limit. He should reject and try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I'm confident this product has value, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 12000}
