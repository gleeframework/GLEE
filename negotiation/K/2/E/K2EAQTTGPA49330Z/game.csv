"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I'm confident this product has value, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this deal work.",12000.0,Bob,4,
