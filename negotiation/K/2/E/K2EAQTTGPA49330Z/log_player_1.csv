"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $22,000 to start negotiations."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $10,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  Could you consider $18,000? This feels like a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit.  I'm confident this product has value, and I'm hoping we can find a way to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his offers are escalating slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach a price close enough to $15,000 in the remaining rounds to make continuing negotiations worthwhile. Accepting John's offer guarantees the best price without further risk."
