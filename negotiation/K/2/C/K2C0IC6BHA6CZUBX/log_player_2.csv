"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $120 is better than buying from John for $150. 
* Even though the product is worth $100 to Alice, it's worth $150 to you, so getting it for $120 is a good deal."
