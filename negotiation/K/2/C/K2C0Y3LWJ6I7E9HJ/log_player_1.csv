Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll see if I can convince Bob to come up a little higher in the next round."

Round 6

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. Bob's offers are getting too low for my comfort, and I'm not confident I can get a significantly higher price from him.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John and move on."
