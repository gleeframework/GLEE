Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it's worth it at $119."", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible without going below your minimum ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit higher ($119) leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer or feel like he's getting a slight discount.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum price. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while having John as a reliable backup buyer."
