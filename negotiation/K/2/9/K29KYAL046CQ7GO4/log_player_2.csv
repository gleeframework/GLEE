"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I think you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and the product's value to her.  There's plenty of room for negotiation. You should reject this offer and propose a counteroffer significantly lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in the product's value at my initial asking price, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we consider $1,800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice came down in price, but it's still significantly above your target price and John's offer. It's worth seeing if she's willing to negotiate further."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However,  $1,800,000 is still a bit further than I'm comfortable going. To be fair, I could make a move on my end.  Would you be open to considering $1,250,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're getting closer.  While $1,250,000 is a significant jump from my last offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair and final offer reflecting the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down significantly, her ""final offer"" is still $100,000 more than John's guaranteed price. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation with Alice are outweighed by the risk that she won't budge further.  You're better off securing the product from John at your target price."
