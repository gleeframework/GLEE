"Hello Alice, thanks for presenting your offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point you've suggested is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in the product's value at my initial asking price, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we consider $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However,  $1,800,000 is still a bit further than I'm comfortable going. To be fair, I could make a move on my end.  Would you be open to considering $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're getting closer.  While $1,250,000 is a significant jump from my last offer, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair and final offer reflecting the true value of this product.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
