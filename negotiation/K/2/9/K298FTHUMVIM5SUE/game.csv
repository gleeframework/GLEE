"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $550,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's true value. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $525,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous one. Would you be willing to accept $512,500?",512500.0,Alice,5,
