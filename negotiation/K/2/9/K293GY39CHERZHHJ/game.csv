"Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant investment.  I'm initially offering it to you for $1,500,000.  I'm confident that its value will far exceed this price in the long run.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price point is simply too high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price reflects its inherent value and future prospects.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you value the product highly, but I need to see a price that makes sense for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your offer is getting closer to the realm of possibility. To be fair, I'm prepared to make a significant move.  My final offer is $1,250,000.  This is a very competitive price considering the product's potential.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While your final offer is tempting, I'm afraid $1,100,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  This is a significant investment for me, and I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
