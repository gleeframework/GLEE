Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $150, it's worth attempting to get a higher price from Bob first. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product just below my minimum acceptable price creates a sense of urgency and makes the deal seem more attractive. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I haven't included an explicit invitation to negotiate, setting the price slightly high leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still making the offer appealing enough for Bob to consider."
