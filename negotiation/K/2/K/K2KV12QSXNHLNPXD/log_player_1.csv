"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential""  subtly reinforces the product's worth, justifying the high initial price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The tone remains friendly and open-ended (""What are your thoughts?""), encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,125,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly below both your minimum and his stated value for the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. Proceeding to the next round allows for further negotiation. Selling to John immediately nets the guaranteed value but cuts off potential for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging but not Agreeing:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer without validating its fairness. 
* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:** The counteroffer is a significant reduction from the initial price but still keeps us well above both Bob's offer and our minimum.
* **Highlighting Compromise:** Framing the new price as a ""fair compromise"" encourages Bob to reciprocate with movement on his end. 
* **Maintaining Confidence:** The tone remains confident in the product's value, signaling that we're not desperate for any deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That feels like a fair deal to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price, which also aligns with his own valuation of the product.  This represents a successful negotiation outcome. While there might be a slim chance of pushing for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal altogether likely outweighs the potential reward at this point."
