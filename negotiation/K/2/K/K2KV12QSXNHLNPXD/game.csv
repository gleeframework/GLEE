"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,125,000 for the product.",1125000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, that price doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but that's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? That feels like a fair deal to me.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
