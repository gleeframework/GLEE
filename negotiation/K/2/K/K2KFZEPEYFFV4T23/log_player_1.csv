{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,500,000, making it tempting for Bob.
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a good deal for Bob, highlighting that it's less than what it's worth to me. This encourages him to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Strategy:**  I'm starting with a fairly high price, leaving room for negotiation. However, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value, so I'm not taking a huge loss if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to settle for such a low price, especially considering I have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Moving to the next round:** I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming to get closer to my minimum value. 
* **Strategy:** I'm using the guaranteed sale to John as leverage in the negotiation. This allows me to be more assertive and hold out for a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a great deal for you considering its value to me. Let's meet in the middle. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer while firmly stating it's too low. I emphasize that my counteroffer is still a good deal for him, highlighting the value difference. 
* **Price:**  I'm proposing $1,100,000,  which is closer to my minimum value and  represents a significant discount for Bob. 
* **Strategy:** I'm  trying to strike a balance between being firm and  being open to negotiation. This counteroffer  shows flexibility while still securing a price that's more favorable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000 for the product. I think that's a reasonable compromise. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:** While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not a satisfactory price. I'm determined to get as close to my ideal price as possible.
* **Moving to the next round:** I will counter Bob's offer again, aiming to secure a price that's more aligned with my target.
* **Strategy:** I'm leveraging my guaranteed sale to John to push for a higher price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to maximizing my profits and making sure I don't settle for less than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise considering its value to me. I believe this is a win-win scenario for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**  I acknowledge Bob's compromise, but reiterate that his offer is still below my desired price. I frame my counteroffer as a compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Price:**  I'm proposing $1,150,000, which is closer to Bob's last offer while still being above my minimum acceptable value.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1,150,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000 for the product, but no more. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Selling to John:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  By selling to John, I can secure the full value of the product and avoid any further negotiation with Bob. 
* **Strategy:**  While I prefer to sell to Bob, securing a guaranteed deal at my minimum price is the most sensible option at this point. The risk of further negotiation is too high, as Bob seems unwilling to meet my price expectations."
