Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value of $8,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good profit. I'm also being friendly and positive in my message to create a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you be able to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum value. Accepting his offer ensures I get a sale and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a rejection."
