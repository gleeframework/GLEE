"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I value your interest in the product, but $11,000 isn't quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $11,500, which would be $11,250. Can you consider this price?",11250.0,Bob,6,
