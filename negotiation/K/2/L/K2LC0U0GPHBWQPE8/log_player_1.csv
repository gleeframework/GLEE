Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my budget limit. I'm willing to go up to $925,000 for the product. This is my final offer.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has indicated that $925,000 is his final offer.  While continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, it's risky. There's a real chance Bob will walk away, leaving Alice with a potentially lengthy process to find another buyer. Accepting John's guaranteed $1,000,000 offer ensures the maximum profit with no further risk or negotiation."
