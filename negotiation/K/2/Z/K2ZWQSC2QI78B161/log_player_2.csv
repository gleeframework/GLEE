"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($110)** is better than John's offer ($120). 
* Your maximum value is $120, so even though you could save $10 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John, it's still a good deal to accept and save $10 compared to John's price."
