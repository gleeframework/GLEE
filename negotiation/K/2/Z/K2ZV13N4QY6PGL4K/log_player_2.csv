{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a better price.  There's no reason to buy from John immediately, as you could potentially get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, and it signals my serious intent to negotiate. This price is also well below my maximum budget of $1,500,000, giving me room to compromise if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's new offer is still above my maximum budget. While it is closer, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I believe there's potential to get a better price by continuing the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,300,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. It shows I'm serious about buying the product but also signals that I'm still willing to negotiate. This price also keeps me within my budget, leaving room for further compromise if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,500,000. While it's tempting to accept because it's only $100,000 more than John's offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I can try one more counteroffer to see if I can get the price down to my desired level."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my offer again to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it still keeps me within my maximum budget. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it. If she rejects, I'll be forced to buy from John as it's the only option remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $50,000 above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  There is no point in negotiating further, as I have already made multiple compromises and I am unwilling to go over my budget.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $1,500,000."
