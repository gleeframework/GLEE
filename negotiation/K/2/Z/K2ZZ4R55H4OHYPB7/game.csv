"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $750,000 is significantly below my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $925,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.  How about we meet at $850,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
