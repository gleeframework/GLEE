"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both you and Alice, there's no benefit to accepting her offer. Buying from John for the same price is the same outcome, so there's no reason to choose Alice over John."
