"Alice, your initial offer is quite high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still below what I need to consider. Given the product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer.  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950000.  This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to drop the price to $1000000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
