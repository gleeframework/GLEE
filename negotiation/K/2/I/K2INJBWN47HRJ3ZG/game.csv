"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I understand the value of the product but I can't go above $1,200,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and acknowledging the product's value.  To be frank, $1,200,000 is quite a way off from what I had in mind. Let's meet closer in the middle.  How about we consider $1,900,000? This offer reflects a willingness to negotiate while still respecting the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still outside of my range. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about we split the difference and aim for $1,550,000? This feels like a fair starting point to bridge the gap.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
