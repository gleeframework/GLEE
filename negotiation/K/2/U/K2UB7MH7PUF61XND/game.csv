"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only justify spending up to $600,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider $950,000. This offer reflects a considerable compromise on my end.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While that price is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Would you consider $725,000? That's a substantial offer and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  My absolute lowest price is $850,000. This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to reach a deal with you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
