Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $14,999. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $15,000 as possible, as that's her guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting very close to her minimum allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Psychology:** Offering a price just below a round number creates a sense of urgency and makes it seem like Bob is getting a slightly better deal. 

**Important Note:** While this strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit, it's important to consider Bob's perspective.  There's a chance he might find the price too high and walk away, even though it's significantly more than the product's worth to him.  A successful negotiation often involves finding a balance where both parties feel they are getting a fair deal."
