"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's a great deal for you, as it's worth much more to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's perceived value:** By mentioning the product's worth to me, I subtly suggest it's a good deal for him.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Setting the stage for a potential ""John"" exit:**  If Bob doesn't budge, I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. This still allows me to save some money while getting a valuable item. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $9,500 is significantly lower than my desired price point.  While it's a step up from his initial valuation, it's not yet profitable enough for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  There's room for further negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not desperate and can potentially push for a higher price.
* **""John"" is a safety net:** I can always walk away and sell to John if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to make a decent deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but I'm not giving in completely. $11,000 is a compromise that shows I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Focusing on fairness:**  I emphasize ""fairness"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and suggest that this price is mutually beneficial. 
* **Staying above my minimum:**  My price is still significantly higher than my minimum of $15,000, keeping my profit margin healthy. 
* **Maintaining a ""John"" exit strategy:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if Bob rejects my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to counter with a price of $10,500 for the product. This still allows me to save some money while acquiring a valuable item. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my target:** $10,500 is still below my desired price range, even though it's closer to my minimum. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more.
* **Negotiation is progressing:**  Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, so there's still potential for a successful deal.
* **""John"" is always an option:**  If this round doesn't work out, I can still sell to John and get my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,750. This is a good compromise for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but significant move:** I'm only moving $250 closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm serious about reaching an agreement but not giving in completely.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize ""good compromise"" and ""making this deal happen"" to create a sense of urgency and optimism.
* **Maintaining a small margin:** $10,750 is still above my minimum and keeps my profit margin respectable.
* **Keeping ""John"" in mind:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can always sell to John and secure my desired price."
