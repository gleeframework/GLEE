"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $110? That way, we both get a good deal.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $105 is still a bit too low for me.  If you're serious about buying the product, let's split the difference at $107.50. That's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,
