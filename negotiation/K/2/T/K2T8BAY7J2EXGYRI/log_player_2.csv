"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $15,000, but Alice's initial offer is $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is likely.** There's room for negotiation to get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  This is a good safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:**  $10,000 is a significant discount from Alice's offer, showing your willingness to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  There's still room to move upwards if necessary. 
* **Emphasizes your value:**  ""Worth more than that to you"" subtly implies Alice might be undervaluing the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still find this product worth it at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  While Alice has lowered the price, $11,000 is still more than you are comfortable with. 
* **More room for negotiation:**  There's still room to bring the price down closer to your ideal price point.
* **Buying from John is still a safe option:**  If negotiations fail, you can still buy from John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This feels like a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slightly aggressive counteroffer:**  Offers a compromise, but still keeps the pressure on Alice to lower her price.
* **Focuses on mutual benefit:**  Emphasizes the ""good deal"" for both of you to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness.
* **Confident tone:**  The ""good use"" statement subtly suggests that the product is valuable to you, reinforcing your position."
