,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about $11,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still find this product worth it at that price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,500.  This feels like a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,
