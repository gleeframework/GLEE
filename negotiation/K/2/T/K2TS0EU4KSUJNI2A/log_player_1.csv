Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This offer reflects a more reasonable middle ground."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $2,000,000 is still significantly above what I can afford.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to see more movement from his side."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I truly appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,700,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high. I'm confident this product is worth it, but my maximum is $1,200,000. Let's bridge this gap and find a final solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is now getting much closer to my baseline. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm willing to counter one more time to see if we can land closer to $1,500,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been great to negotiate with and I want to seal this deal.  Let's land in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  I'm committed to acquiring this product, but $1,450,000 remains outside my budget. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value we've discussed. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'm confident we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob seems firm on his $1,200,000 offer, and it's unlikely he'll significantly increase it in the remaining rounds. It's time to cut my losses.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees I meet my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob not budging."
