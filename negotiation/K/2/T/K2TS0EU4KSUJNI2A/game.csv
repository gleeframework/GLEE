"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is far beyond my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to pay $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This offer reflects a more reasonable middle ground.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $2,000,000 is still significantly above what I can afford.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in this product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I truly appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $1,700,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high. I'm confident this product is worth it, but my maximum is $1,200,000. Let's bridge this gap and find a final solution.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you've been great to negotiate with and I want to seal this deal.  Let's land in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the product's true worth.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating.  I'm committed to acquiring this product, but $1,450,000 remains outside my budget. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the value we've discussed. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
