"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a price well below its true worth.  I understand its worth to you is $800,000, but this deal allows you to secure it for a significant profit.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her product's value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting her offer, you can proceed to buy from John at a much better price."
