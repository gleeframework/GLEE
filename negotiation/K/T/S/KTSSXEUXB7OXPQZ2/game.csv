"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $60. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for getting closer to my price range, Alice. While $90 is better, it's still a touch more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $75?  That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to get closer to your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $85. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to go up a bit, how about we split the difference and settle at $80? That's the most I can do.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $80. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $87. I think this is the best compromise we can reach, and I'm willing to work with you to finalize the deal.",87.0,Alice,7,
