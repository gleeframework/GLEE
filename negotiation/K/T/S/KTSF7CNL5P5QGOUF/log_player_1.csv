Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, the message hints at its worth by mentioning ""given its value.""
* **Alternative Buyer:** The message subtly implies you have other options (""before I list it publicly"") which creates a sense of urgency and scarcity.
* **Respectful Tone:** The tone is polite and professional, encouraging a positive interaction. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This initial offer is just a starting point. 
* Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have a buffer between your asking price and your minimum selling price.
* Be aware of Bob's reactions and adjust your approach accordingly."
