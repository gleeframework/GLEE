Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
