# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product at a premium price of $20,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm willing to negotiate if you have any concerns.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay. He can get a better deal by either counter-offering or buying from John."
