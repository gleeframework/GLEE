"Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
