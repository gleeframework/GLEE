"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is better than $150, you want to try and get a better price. You have 10 rounds and can counter-offer. It's worth seeing if Alice will lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'd be happy to pay $125.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $130 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to your ideal price, you still want to try and negotiate further. Alice is showing flexibility, so there's a good chance you can get closer to your $125 target with another counter-offer. You have plenty of rounds left to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $135 is still a bit too high for me. How about $130? It's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $135 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $130. I can offer you a compromise at $132.50. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $132.50, which is a good compromise. While you could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or you running out of rounds is increasing.  $132.50 is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John. It's a good time to accept and close the deal."
