# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth a lot more to you than that. I'm looking forward to hearing back from you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  Even though the product is worth more to Bob, Alice's offer of $12,000 is still cheaper than John's price of $15,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  Accepting Alice's offer achieves that goal."
