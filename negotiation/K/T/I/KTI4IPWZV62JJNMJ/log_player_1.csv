Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll try to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,000, so I'll offer $8,000. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is the same as what John is offering.  Since I can get $8,000 immediately from John, I'm going to sell to John now. There's no guarantee that Bob will accept my counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed sale."
