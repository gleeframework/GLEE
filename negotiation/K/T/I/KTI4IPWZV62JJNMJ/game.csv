"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,000, so I'll offer $8,000. Is that something you'd consider?",8000.0,Bob,4,
