Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great price for you considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $9,000 is still a bit high for me, considering the product's value to me is lower than what Alice values it at. I'll reject her offer and make another counteroffer.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer to Alice. I'm willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product, which is closer to the value Alice places on it.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from the value I have in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9,000, so I'll offer $8,000. Is that something you'd consider?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
