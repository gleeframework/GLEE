Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum value but gives Bob some room to negotiate. It also leaves room for me to potentially make a counteroffer if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send him a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,200 is still below my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum value and a decent outcome.  Further negotiation might yield a slightly better price, but there's a chance Bob will walk away, and selling to John for $15,000 is tempting.  However, to secure a sale, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most reasonable decision."
