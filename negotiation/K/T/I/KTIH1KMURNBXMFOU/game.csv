"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let's see if we can reach a deal closer to that figure.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $11,000 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's try to close this deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $10,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10800.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,200. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $10,600. This is the best price I can offer, considering the value the product brings. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",10600.0,Alice,7,
