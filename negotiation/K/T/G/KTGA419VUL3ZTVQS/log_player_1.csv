Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **The message is friendly and open:** It acknowledges the product's value to Alice while suggesting a price point that could be attractive to Bob. 
* **This offer balances the need to earn as much as possible with the possibility of a counteroffer and the option to sell to John for $12,000.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the product's value to you, but I believe I can't exceed $8,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than Alice's minimum value of $12,000.**  While it's tempting to accept $8,000, it's not a good deal for Alice.
* **Rejecting the offer allows Alice to make a counteroffer.** This keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a more favorable price for her. 
* **Selling to John for $12,000 is always an option, but it's better to try to get closer to that price with Bob.** There's still a chance Bob might be willing to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with a reasonable price:** $9,000 is a compromise, higher than Bob's offer but lower than Alice's initial offer.
* **Emphasis on a mutually beneficial outcome:** The message emphasizes finding a ""middle ground"" to encourage Bob to come up in price. 
* **Reiterates the value of the product:**  This subtly reminds Bob that the product is worth more than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm not comfortable going above $8,000 for the product. Could we meet somewhere in between these two figures? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer of $8,500 is getting closer to Alice's minimum value of $12,000.**  While still lower than ideal, it's a significant improvement over his previous offer.
* **Accepting the offer secures a sale and a profit.**  It's better to secure a deal at $8,500 than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price or no sale at all.
* **Selling to John for $12,000 is still an option, but the risk of further negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential for a higher price.** Alice is now in a good position to sell the product and move on."
