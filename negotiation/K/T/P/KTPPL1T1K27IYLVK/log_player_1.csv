Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While unlikely, starting at $119 leaves a tiny bit of room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Appeal to Value:**  Highlighting ""value"" might make Bob feel better about a price slightly above his perceived worth.

It's unlikely Bob will pay more than $100, but this strategy gives me the best chance to maximize profit before going to John."
