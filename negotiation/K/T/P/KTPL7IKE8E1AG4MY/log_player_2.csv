"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $950000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering its true value to you is $1000000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

Alice's initial offer is close to your maximum budget, but you can likely get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and see if you can drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the potential value this product holds for me. However, $950,000 is a bit high for my initial budget. I'd like to start with an offer of $850,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering your valuation of $800,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to lower my price to $920000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair middle ground. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's counteroffer is still closer to her desired price than yours.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your target price. There's still room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $920,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'd like to propose $880,000 as a fair compromise. This price reflects the value you placed on the product and allows for some room for profit for you. Let's find common ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 880000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $880000. After reconsidering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll lower my price to $900000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still higher than your ideal price. You have several rounds left, and there's a good chance you can get closer to your desired $850,000.  Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle one more time. I'm willing to go up to $890,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 890000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $890000. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $915000. This is a fair price that takes into account the product's true value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer and now sits just above the midpoint between your current offer and her previous offer.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries a risk that you might not reach a deal or that her offers will start moving back up. At this point, it's better to accept Alice's offer. You are only $15,000 over your last offer, and buying from John would cost you $100,000 more than Alice's current offer."
