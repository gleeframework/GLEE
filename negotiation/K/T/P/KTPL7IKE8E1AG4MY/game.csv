"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $950000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering its true value to you is $1000000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the potential value this product holds for me. However, $950000 is a bit high for my initial budget. I'd like to start with an offer of $850000.  I believe this is a fair starting point considering your valuation of $800000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to lower my price to $920000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. I believe this is a fair middle ground. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $920000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from my target price. I'd like to propose $880000 as a fair compromise. This price reflects the value you placed on the product and allows for some room for profit for you. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $880000. After reconsidering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll lower my price to $900000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle one more time. I'm willing to go up to $890000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",890000.0,Bob,6,
