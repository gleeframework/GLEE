"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $10,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,250 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  If that's not workable, I'll have to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
