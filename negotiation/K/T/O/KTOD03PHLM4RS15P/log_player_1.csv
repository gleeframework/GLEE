{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is above your minimum value and leaves room for some back and forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price that reflects its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take $800,000, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob since I can always sell to John for $1,000,000.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
