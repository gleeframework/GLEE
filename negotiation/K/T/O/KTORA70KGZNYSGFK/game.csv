"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $825,000. This still leaves a good margin for you while ensuring I get a fair price. Let's make this work!",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still hesitant to go lower than $800,000.  This is a significant investment for you, and I believe it's worth it given the value it brings.  How about we split the difference and settle at $790,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can reach an agreement here.",790000.0,Alice,5,
