"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $80 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and optimistic message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reminding Bob of the product's worth to him subtly pressures him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's interested in the product. There's still room to negotiate a price closer to my target. 
* **Exploring Options:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my minimum and see if he's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's still a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm lowering my price from the previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $125 is a fair price for both of us, appealing to Bob's sense of equity. 
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm using positive language (""Let's make this deal happen!"") to encourage Bob to accept."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob is getting closer, $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to settle for a price that low.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's still room to negotiate a price closer to my target. 
* **Exploring Options:**  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my minimum and see if he's willing to compromise further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.50. This is a fair price, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 112.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer ($125) and Bob's offer ($100). This shows a strong commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize ""fair price"" and ""both walk away satisfied"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity and his desire for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Urgency:** ""Let's make this happen!"" adds a touch of urgency to encourage Bob to accept before he loses the opportunity."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105. This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Even with Bob's slight increase, $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation Continues:** While Bob's offer is closer, there's still room to negotiate a price that's more favorable for me. 
* **Seeking a Better Deal:**  I believe I can still get a higher price, especially since John is willing to pay $150."
