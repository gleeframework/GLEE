"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this truly unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and the market demand.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with the price. How about we discuss $1,250,000? I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your position and I'm keen on finding a solution that works for both of us.  While $1,250,000 is closer to a fair valuation, I'm aiming for a slightly higher return. Would you consider $1,275,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire for a higher return, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,250,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to consider a price closer to your offer, but $1,225,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we settle at $1,260,000?  This keeps us close to the middle ground while recognizing the inherent value of what's being offered.",1260000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $1,240,000. I think this price reflects a fair value for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point.",1240000.0,Bob,8,
