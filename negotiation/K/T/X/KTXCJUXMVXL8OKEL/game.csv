"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is too low for me.  It's important to remember the value this product brings to you.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000.  While that's closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping for a little more room for compromise.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This is a very fair price that balances both of our needs.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 still doesn't reflect the true value this product holds for you. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time.  I'll accept $1,050,000. This is a final offer,  and I believe it's a reasonable price that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
