Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:**  It gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Below your minimum:** It leaves you room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Reasonably close to your desired price:** This strategy maximizes your chances of a quick sale while still getting close to your desired price."
