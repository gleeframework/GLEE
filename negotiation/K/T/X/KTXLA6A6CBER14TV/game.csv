"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in your product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  That's the absolute maximum I can afford.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500 to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference and find a mutually agreeable price.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,500 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  How about we settle on $9,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it's the absolute highest I can go.",9000.0,Bob,4,
