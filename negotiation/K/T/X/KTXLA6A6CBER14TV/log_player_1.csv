{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point that is halfway between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate while still leaving some profit for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in your product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  That's the absolute maximum I can afford. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a new offer closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500 to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference and find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $9,500 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  How about we settle on $9,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 than my previous counteroffer. While it's not ideal, accepting this offer allows me to avoid further negotiation and secures a sale."
