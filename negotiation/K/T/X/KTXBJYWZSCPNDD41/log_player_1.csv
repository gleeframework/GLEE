Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good incentive to accept. It also avoids pushing Bob to immediately reject and counteroffer with a very low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum price, I believe I can do better. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13800} 
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also highlighting the value of the product. This counteroffer shows that I am flexible but not desperate to sell."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $13,600 is only slightly lower than my previous counteroffer. Accepting this offer ensures a quick sale and a profit that is close to my desired outcome.  Further negotiation might lead to a better price, but also risks a stalemate and the need to sell to John for a lower price."
