Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, $2,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. This is my best offer at this time.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $2,000,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.
