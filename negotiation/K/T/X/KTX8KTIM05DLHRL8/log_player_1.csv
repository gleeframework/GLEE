Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is based on the following reasoning:

* **Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so any price below that gives him a potential gain.
* **My minimum:** I want at least $1,000,000, so I need to set the price above that.
* **Negotiation space:**  The $100,000 difference between my minimum and Bob's value gives room for negotiation.  Offering $1,400,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for a possible counter-offer while still securing a substantial profit.

**It's important to note that there are no guarantees Bob will accept.**  However, this offer maximizes my potential profit while still leaving room for a successful negotiation."
