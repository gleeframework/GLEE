Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a chance to acquire a truly valuable product. I know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to part with it for $1,800,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,800,000, you anchor a high price in Bob's mind. Even if he counters, it's likely to be closer to your initial offer than his initial valuation.
* **Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested buyers"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy is aggressive. There's a chance Bob might be put off by the high price and walk away. However, with your guaranteed sale to John, you're not risking losing the $1,000,000 baseline."
