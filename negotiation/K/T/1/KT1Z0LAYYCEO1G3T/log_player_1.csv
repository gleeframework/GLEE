I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also mindful of my minimum price of $15,000, as I can always sell to John if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me, as it's below my minimum price of $15,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I will send Bob a counteroffer.  I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is fair and gives Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
