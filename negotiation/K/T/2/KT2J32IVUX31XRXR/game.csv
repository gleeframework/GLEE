"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is too low for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit to $11,000. This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,500. I'm getting close to walking away, but I really like the product and would like to make a deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
