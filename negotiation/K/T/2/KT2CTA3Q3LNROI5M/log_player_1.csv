Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $19,000.  Let me know your thoughts on this."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and might lead Bob to counter with a price closer to your target.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The high price will immediately gauge Bob's interest. If he's immediately turned off, you know he might be very price-sensitive. 
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's a safety net. This allows you to be bolder in your initial offer to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, we don't know how much he's *willing* to pay.  His budget, urgency, and perceived value might make him willing to go higher.
* **Relationship:** This initial offer doesn't consider the potential for a long-term relationship with Bob. If that's important, a less aggressive starting price might be preferable."
