Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate, but still ensures a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid a Lowball Offer:** Starting too low (e.g., close to $10,000) might make Bob think the product is less valuable and could lead to a lower counter-offer or a complete rejection.
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale with John for $10,000."
