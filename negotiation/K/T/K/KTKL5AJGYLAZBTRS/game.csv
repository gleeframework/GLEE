"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'd be willing to buy the product for $850,000.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for the value you'll get.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a bit more of a discount. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $875,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $887,500? This is a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away with a good deal. Let's make it happen.",887500.0,Alice,5,
