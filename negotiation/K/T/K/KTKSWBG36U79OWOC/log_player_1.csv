Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (You have a guaranteed buyer)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **Potential Profit:**  The difference between Bob's value and your minimum is $300,000. Your goal is to capture as much of this as possible.

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a backup offer. This means you don't need to desperately lowball the price for Bob.  Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer slightly below your minimum but high enough that Bob might still consider it. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you come down later.
2. **Highlight Value:**  Instead of just focusing on the price, emphasize the product's worth to Bob. What benefits will he gain?

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name]. I know it's something that could significantly benefit your business, given its potential to [mention a key benefit related to Bob's needs/industry]. I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** The offered price is slightly below your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the product's benefit to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone suggests a willingness to discuss, which is crucial in negotiations.

**Important Note:**  Remember, this is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or even reject it. You can then decide whether to negotiate further or move on to your guaranteed sale to John."
