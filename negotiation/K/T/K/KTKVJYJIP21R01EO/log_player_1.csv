Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think would be a great fit for you.  My asking price is $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Friendly opening:**  A friendly message sets a positive tone for the negotiation.
* **Focus on value:**  I'm emphasizing that the product is valuable to Bob, encouraging him to consider it."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
