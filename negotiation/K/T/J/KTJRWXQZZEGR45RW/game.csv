"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get closer to the original price I had in mind. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than that. I'll counter with a price of $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit concerned about the price.

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to feel confident that we're at a fair price. I'll counter with a price of $1025000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value, while also being more in line with your budget. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I appreciate your persistence and willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975000 just yet. I'll make one more counteroffer, and it's a significant concession. I'll meet you at $1000000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If we can agree on this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,7,
