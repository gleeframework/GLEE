``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for you.  If he rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer, always keeping in mind John's offer of $1,200,000 as your fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I want to maximize profit, I am willing to negotiate further. I will counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. However, $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I will not settle for a price that is significantly less than my value of the product. I'm confident that we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $700,000 is still a bit below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $775,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a great investment for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 775000}
