"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,100,000. This suggests she's willing to negotiate. It's in Bob's best interest to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to move a bit on price, but $900,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,025,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit high. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice will come down even more."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still a bit higher than I can go right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your position. Let's make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $980,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $980,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, it's a good deal. It's within Bob's budget, and it's likely that Alice won't go lower.  Rejecting this offer risks having to buy from John at $800,000, which doesn't offer any further savings."
