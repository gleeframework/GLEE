# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your budget.  While it's a compromise, it's still not within your financial limit. You should reject and try to negotiate further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it. I'm confident that this price is fair, given the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1100000, which is $1000000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000, which is the price John is also offering. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the fact that I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as the next best offer I have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget. While it's the same price as John's offer, you are trying to save as much money as possible. Therefore, you should buy the product from John for $800,000."
