"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. I'm willing to make a generous offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but unfortunately, $1200000 is far beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it and my need to stay within budget. ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $900000 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it. I'm confident that this price is fair, given the value of the product to both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1100000, which is $1000000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000, which is the price John is also offering. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and the fact that I'm willing to sell it to you at the same price as the next best offer I have.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
