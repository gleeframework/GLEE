Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.

Alice is firm on her lowest price being $10,200.  It's better to cut my losses and purchase from John for the guaranteed $10,000."
