Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $10,000. Let me know if that works for you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.

Bob's offer:

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $14,000 mark I need. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, and it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob.  It's time to move on to a sure thing."
