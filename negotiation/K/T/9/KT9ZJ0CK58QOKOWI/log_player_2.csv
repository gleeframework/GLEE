"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, you can likely get it for even less. You know the product is worth $15,000 to you, so there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can explore a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000.  This would still be a great deal for both of us, as it's above your minimum and below my maximum.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. After reconsidering, I'm willing to compromise and sell the product to you for $11500. This is still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original price, which is positive. However, you still have room to negotiate. You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is at $11,500, so there's still a good chance you can get the price lower.  Rejecting the offer will give you a chance to see if you can squeeze out a better deal."

# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. After reevaluating, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell the product to you for $11250.

Alice has come down to $11,250. This is a good deal for you, considering your maximum is $15,000.

Accepting this offer guarantees you get the product at a reasonable price."
