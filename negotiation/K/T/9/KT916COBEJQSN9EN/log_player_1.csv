{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal but leaving room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build rapport by mentioning how much Bob might value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a similar product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay up to $100 for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's too low for me.  While I could sell to John for $100, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm going to try to negotiate further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105?  That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I would like to counter with $95 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm tempted to take the $95 from Bob, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I believe I can get at least $100.  I'm going to make another counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a fair price, but $95 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $102.50? This is a good deal for both of us, and lets us close this deal without further delay."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
