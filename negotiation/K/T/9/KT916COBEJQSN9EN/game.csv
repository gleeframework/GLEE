,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $105?  That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I would like to counter with $95 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a fair price, but $95 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $102.50? This is a good deal for both of us, and lets us close this deal without further delay.",102.5,Alice,5,
