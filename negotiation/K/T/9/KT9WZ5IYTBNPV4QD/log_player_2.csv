Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll counter with a price of $14,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $13,500 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more attempt to meet you in the middle.
