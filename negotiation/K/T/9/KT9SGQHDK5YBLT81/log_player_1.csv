Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm starting with a price of $135.  This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum but still within a reasonable range for Bob, considering he values the product at $120.  I'm hoping to get close to my ideal price while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While $100 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $120.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter with $115. This is a compromise, acknowledging that Bob might not be willing to pay my initial price but still maintaining a profit for me.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot where both of us can agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $110 is getting closer to my desired price.  While it's still below my ideal price, it's getting very close to my minimum value.  I'm going to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation, especially considering that I can sell to John for $120 if this deal falls through.  It's better to secure a sale now than to risk losing both Bob and John."
