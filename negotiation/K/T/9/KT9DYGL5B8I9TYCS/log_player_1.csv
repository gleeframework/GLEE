Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  This offer represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting very close.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000 to settle this today.  This is a very competitive offer and demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm running out of rounds and I'm worried about not being able to reach a deal I'm happy with. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and saves me the risk of further negotiations that might not be successful."
