"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1,200,000 is simply too far below my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still gives you a significant opportunity for profit.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,600,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I can accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would you consider $1,450,000? It's a good price for both of us, and it ensures we both walk away with a positive outcome.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,350,000. This is still a good price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at this point. What do you think?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference once more. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to get this valuable product.  What do you say?",1400000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand that we're close, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you at $1,380,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal. What do you think?",1380000.0,Bob,8,
