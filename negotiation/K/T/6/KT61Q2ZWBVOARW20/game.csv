,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $8,800 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer you the product for $8,950. This is the absolute lowest I can go. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",8950.0,Alice,7,
