"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Flexibility:** I'm not going to set a hard limit on my price just yet, allowing me to negotiate if Bob rejects my initial offer.
* **John as backup:** The knowledge that John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me a strong negotiating position. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John if negotiations fall through.

I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer,  $9,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm hoping we can agree on $11,000.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value you've mentioned. Let's try to find a compromise!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  I'm not accepting his offer but showing willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding him of the value he sees in the product, implying a potential for a good deal.
* **Setting a target:** $11,000 is a price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still within a reasonable range for Bob.
* **Open communication:** I'm keeping the communication open and encouraging further discussion.

Let's see if this counteroffer moves the negotiations closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  While Bob is getting closer, $10,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **More room for negotiation:** We are only at round 4, so there is still time to get a better price.
* **John is my safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations with Bob don't work out.

I'll counter Bob's offer again, trying to inch closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $10,500 is a little too low for me. How about $11,250?  That's a good compromise, and it brings us closer to a deal. Let's try to find a price that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise by offering a price that's halfway between his offer and my previous one. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive and friendly to maintain a good rapport.
* **Emphasizing compromise:** I'm reiterating that this is a compromise,  making it sound like a fair solution.
* **Moving the needle:** $11,250 is closer to my desired price and is still a good deal for Bob considering the value he's placed on the product. 

Let's see if Bob is ready to agree to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,750, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $10,750 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Only 4 rounds left:** While time is running out, I'm not desperate yet. There's still potential to get a better offer.
* **John is a viable alternative:**  I can always sell to John for a much higher price if this negotiation fails.

I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to work with you. But $10,750 is just too low for me. To make this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you've mentioned, and it brings us closer to an agreement. Let's try to make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down slightly from my previous offer, but I'm staying firm on a price that's still closer to my desired value. 
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value he sees in the product, making my offer seem more appealing.
* **Urgency:**  I'm using language that suggests this is a good opportunity to close the deal, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Finality:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm making it clear that this is my final offer. I'm leaving the door open for Bob to accept, but I'm also ready to walk away if he doesn't.

With only a few rounds left, I need to be firm while also showing willingness to compromise. This counteroffer will either lead to a deal or signal to Bob that I'm serious about my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We are in round 8, leaving only two rounds left. 
* **No significant progress:** Bob's offers are still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds.
* **John's offer is much better:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a much more profitable option,  and it eliminates the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob. 

While I'm always open to a good deal, I'm not willing to settle for a price that is significantly lower than what John is offering. I'm going to sell to John and move on."
