"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to secure an item that is valued at $15,000 to you, at a price that is higher than my cost but still offers you a significant discount. I look forward to your response.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible, and $14,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Would you consider $13,000? This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your value of $12,000.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your desire to save more. In light of this, I am willing to consider $13,500 as the price for the product. This still allows me to make a profit while providing you with a reasonable saving compared to the original asking price. I hope this proposal works for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,
