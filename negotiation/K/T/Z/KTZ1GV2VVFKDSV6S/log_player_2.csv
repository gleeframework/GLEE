"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14,000. This is a fantastic opportunity for you to secure an item that is valued at $15,000 to you, at a price that is higher than my cost but still offers you a significant discount. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get the product for less than $14,000. Since Alice values the product at $12,000, there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to save as much as possible, and $14,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable paying. Would you consider $13,000? This would still be a good deal for you, as it's well above your value of $12,000."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your desire to save more. In light of this, I am willing to consider $13,500 as the price for the product. This still allows me to make a profit while providing you with a reasonable saving compared to the original asking price. I hope this proposal works for you.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial maximum of $15,000 and still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking a potential stalemate in negotiations."
