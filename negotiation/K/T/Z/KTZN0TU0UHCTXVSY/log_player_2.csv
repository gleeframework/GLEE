**Reasoning:**  Alice has come down to a price that is within a reasonable range, and she's indicated this is her final offer. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she'll hold firm or the negotiations could stall. Accepting at $1,175,000 secures a decent price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John for $1,500,000."
