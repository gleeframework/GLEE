"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It has a lot of potential for your business, and I believe it could be worth even more than $1,500,000 to you in the long run. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000, considering the immense value it brings. Let's discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's potential, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its current market value and my potential use for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the value I know this product will bring to your business, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  It's a fair price that reflects both the product's potential and your willingness to invest.  Let's see if we can find common ground on this offer.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000?  I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while being realistic for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

I believe this is a good compromise, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still quite interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little too high for me. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  This demonstrates my strong interest while acknowledging the value of the product. What do you say?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
