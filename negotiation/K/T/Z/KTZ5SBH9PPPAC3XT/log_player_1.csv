"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth the price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate. It also sets the tone for a potential win-win situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject the offer and try to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you consider $9,500? It's a fair compromise and I believe it's still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $9,200 is still less than my ideal price, it's close enough and significantly better than selling to John. I'm willing to close the deal at this price to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale."
