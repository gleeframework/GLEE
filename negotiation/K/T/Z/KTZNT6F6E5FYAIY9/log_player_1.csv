Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, it's still higher than what the product is worth to him. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed option, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,500,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,300,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than the value I place on the product. I'm hoping to secure a higher price by continuing negotiations, and I'm confident that I can do better than $1,300,000. Selling to John at this point would guarantee a higher price, but I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle at $1,400,000?  This would be a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing negotiations. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,350,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still do better. I'm willing to keep negotiating and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. Selling to John now would guarantee a higher price, but I believe I can get even more from Bob with a little more persistence."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000 to make this work for me.  Would you consider a final offer of $1,375,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1375000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,375,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only 2 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly clear that Bob and I are not going to reach a mutually agreeable price. While $1,325,000 is closer to my desired price than earlier offers, it's still below my minimum threshold. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not confident that I can secure a higher price in the remaining rounds. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to guarantee a profitable outcome."
