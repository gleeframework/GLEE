"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially get a better deal than $1,400,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money.  Since John is willing to sell for $1,500,000, Bob has a benchmark to compare Alice's counteroffers to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I'm unable to go as low as $1,200,000.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,300,000, which is a good price for Bob. While he could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk Alice might not budge, and he would end up paying more from John.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most rational choice as it secures the product for a reasonable price within Bob's budget."
