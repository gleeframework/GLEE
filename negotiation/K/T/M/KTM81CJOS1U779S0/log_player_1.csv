Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $1,400,000 is a strong opening price that leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Value proposition:**  I've emphasized the product's value to justify the price.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message indicates a willingness to discuss the price further. 

This strategy aims to secure a high initial price while leaving the door open for compromise if Bob shows resistance. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net in case negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000. This product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than John's offer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob.  

* **Bob's value:** He's stated the product is valuable to him, indicating he's willing to pay more than $1,200,000.
* **Room for compromise:** There's a significant gap between Bob's offer and my initial price.  I can counteroffer with a price closer to my initial $1,400,000 and see if we can find a middle ground. 
* **Risk management:**  Selling to John is a secure option, but I'm not yet ready to accept a lower price. I'll aim for a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, I'm unable to go as low as $1,200,000.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer but still above Bob's. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining my negotiating position. 
* **Value justification:** I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to reconsider his offer.
* **Mutual benefit:**  I emphasize the potential for a win-win scenario, hoping to appeal to Bob's desire for a successful transaction. 

This counteroffer aims to close the gap between our initial positions while maintaining a comfortable margin above John's offer."
