{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point, aiming for a price slightly below Bob's perceived value but still above my minimum.  It leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just above my minimum acceptable price of $120, and given that I can sell to John for $120, it's better to accept Bob's offer and make a profit."
