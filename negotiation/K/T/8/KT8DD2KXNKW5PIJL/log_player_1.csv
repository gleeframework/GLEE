Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob is willing to pay more, while still ensuring I get a profit above my minimum value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not going to accept it right away.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $150. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a profit higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer of $130 is only $5 less than my previous counteroffer of $135.  It's a good deal, getting me closer to my ideal price while still ensuring a profit.  I'll accept his offer."
