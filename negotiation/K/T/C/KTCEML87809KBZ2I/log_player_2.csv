"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $95. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first. $95 is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the quality of your product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $65? I believe that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation.  It also establishes my budget constraints and my desire to find a mutually beneficial deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. While I appreciate your budget constraints, I need to maintain my minimum price for the product. I would like to counter with an offer of $80. This allows us both to reach a fair agreement. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has met my maximum price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or buying from John, as they both offer the same price."
