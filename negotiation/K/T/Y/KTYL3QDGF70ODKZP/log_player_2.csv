Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,000, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, though.

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly lower price, but the potential savings are getting smaller with each round. 
* **Time Cost:** Each round takes time.  The extra $100 you might save by continuing isn't worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.
* **Alternative:** You have a backup plan with John at $12,000.  Accepting $10,100 from Alice is a significant saving compared to your alternative."
