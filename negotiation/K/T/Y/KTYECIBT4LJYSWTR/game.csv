"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $5000 for the product. I hope this offer is acceptable.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you taking an interest in the product.  While $5000 is a bit below my minimum, I'm willing to compromise. How about $12000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's a price I can live with. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $8000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value you place on it. I look forward to your response.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer.  I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price at this point.",10000.0,Alice,5,
