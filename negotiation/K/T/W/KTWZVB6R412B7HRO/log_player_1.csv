Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates my desire to sell the product but not at a significant loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could sell to John now, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

This counteroffer is closer to Bob's offer, but it's still above his perceived value. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but I still see the product as worth more than $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could continue negotiating, there is a risk that the negotiations will drag on and I might not be able to reach my desired price. Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure a quick and profitable transaction."
