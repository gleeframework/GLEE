Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested but more in the $60 range.  Would you be willing to come down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
