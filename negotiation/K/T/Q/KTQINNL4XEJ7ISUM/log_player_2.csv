"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $110. I believe it will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $110 is still cheaper than buying from John for $120. 
* Even though the product is worth $80 to Alice, that's not relevant to Bob's decision. Bob only cares about his own valuation of the product and the price he's being offered."
