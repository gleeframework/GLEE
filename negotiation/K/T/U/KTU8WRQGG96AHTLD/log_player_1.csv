Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120:** This is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($80) and leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob. It also invites him to respond and start the negotiation.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price that's closer to your desired outcome and framing the message in a positive way, you increase the chances of Bob accepting the offer or counteroffering with a price that's closer to your target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $100? I'm really looking for a good deal, and that's the most I can afford at the moment. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $100 is a decent amount, it's still below your desired range. You have room to negotiate further with Bob, and there's a chance he might come up in price. Selling to John at this point would be a loss for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a fair offer, I'm hoping to get closer to $110. The product is in excellent condition and it's worth a bit more than that.  I'm open to discussing it further, but I'm not willing to go lower than $110."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$110:**  This price is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** The message is firm but polite, emphasizing the value of the product while also demonstrating flexibility. It also subtly suggests that you're willing to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially push Bob closer to your desired price.  By showing a willingness to compromise, you keep the negotiation going while still advocating for your value."
