# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can likely get a better price than $120. It's worth negotiating further with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is a fair offer, I'm hoping to get closer to $110. The product is in excellent condition and it's worth a bit more than that.  I'm open to discussing it further, but I'm not willing to go lower than $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

$110 is still a good deal for you, as it's within your budget of $150. You're saving $40 compared to buying from John, and it's likely you won't get a much better price from Alice."
