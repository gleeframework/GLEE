"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $825,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $825,000 is closer to my budget, I'm aiming for something a bit lower. Would you consider $750,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $800,000. This is already a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's the best I can do. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
