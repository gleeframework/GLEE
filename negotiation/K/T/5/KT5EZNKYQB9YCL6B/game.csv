"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. While $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I understand you're serious about this.  Let's make this happen - how about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
