"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. The product is worth a lot to me, but I'm not willing to pay full price. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $10,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  $9,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This is my final offer,  and I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,000, which would be $9,750. Can you consider this price?",9750.0,Bob,6,
