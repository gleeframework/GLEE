"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. Is that something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 feels a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $120 is a bit high, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial price.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we settle at $100? That seems like a fair compromise.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to settle at $100 yet. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here. I'll meet you halfway between our last offers.  Would you be willing to do $102.50?",102.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, $102.50 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $105 and $102.50, which would be $103.75. That's my final offer.",103.75,Alice,7,
