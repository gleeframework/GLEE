"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair starting point given its potential.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price given its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but I'm confident that this product offers significantly more potential than that. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $700,000 and $900,000, so how about $800,000? I think that's a fair price for the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
