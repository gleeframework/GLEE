Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it's a fair price for both of us. It's above my minimum of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering $135. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be acceptable to him and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $132 is a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiations.  There's always the chance he'll reject my next counteroffer, and selling to John would only get me $120."
