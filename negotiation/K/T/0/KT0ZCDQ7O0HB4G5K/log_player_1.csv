Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. My counteroffer for the product is $1,300,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm open to negotiation, $1,300,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1,325,000. This allows for a reasonable compromise while still saving you money compared to other potential sellers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd love to get closer to my initial goal, $1,325,000 is still a good price. It's a reasonable compromise and a lot closer to my minimum than selling to John.  Let's seal the deal."
