"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $10,000, which is above my minimum acceptable price but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob to make him more likely to accept a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can get more.  
* **Negotiation potential:** I'm confident that Bob values the product at $12,000. I want to see if I can get closer to that price through further negotiation. 
* **Strategic rejection:**  By rejecting his offer, I'm showing him that I'm serious about getting a better price and encourage him to come up with a higher counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,000 is a fair price, I'm looking for something closer to $9,500 to make this work for me.  Let's see if we can find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a lower price:** I've lowered my price from $10,000 to $9,500, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a fair margin:**  $9,500 is still a decent profit for me and is still below Bob's perceived value of the product.
* **Focus on compromise:** I'm using language that encourages Bob to see this as a mutually beneficial solution.
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive and friendly to maintain a good relationship."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my ideal price, $8,800 is still significantly below what I know the product is worth to Bob. 
* **Room for more negotiation:** There's still some room to negotiate, and I'm confident that I can get a better price if I push a little further. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a quick sale. This can encourage Bob to come back with a more substantial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,200, but that's as low as I can go. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm lowering my price by $300, demonstrating my desire to reach an agreement.
* **Setting a firm lower limit:** $9,200 is close to my minimum acceptable price, so I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to go any lower.
* **Enthusiasm and urgency:** I'm adding a sentence that emphasizes my desire to close the deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  While it's only $300 below my previous counteroffer, I'm still not satisfied with that price. 
* **Limited negotiating time:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation. I need to be strategic and make sure I'm getting a good price. 
* **Exploring the possibility of a higher offer:** I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, Bob will realize he needs to increase his offer if he wants to secure the product.  
* **Potential for a deal in the next few rounds:** I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000 as a final compromise.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe this product is worth it to you. Let's close the deal!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm presenting this as my final offer, emphasizing that I'm willing to go no lower.
* **Value Justification:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and highlighting the fairness of the price.
* **Urgency and Finality:** The ""final compromise"" and ""close the deal"" language create a sense of urgency to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone, despite the firmness of the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Time:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  There's not much time left to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** Bob's offer of $8,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but it still doesn't offer a sufficient profit margin.
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $8,000 is secure and provides a solid return.  It's a safer option than risking further negotiations that may not yield a better outcome.
* **Minimizing Risk:** I've already rejected multiple offers and countered with my own.  There's a chance Bob won't increase his offer, and I could end up with less than what John is offering.  

While I would ideally get closer to my initial desired price, the risk of further negotiation and potentially not reaching a deal is too high at this point. Selling to John guarantees a sale at a price that is acceptable to me."
