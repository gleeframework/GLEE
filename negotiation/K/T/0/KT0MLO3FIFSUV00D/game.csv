"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is significantly higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'd be willing to offer $12,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping to get for it. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a good compromise. Let's finalize this deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
