"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  It's something truly special and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable to you. My initial price for it is $2000000.  This is a fair reflection of its value, but I'm open to discussing it further.  What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1600000. Can you meet me at this price?",1600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $1600000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $1800000.  This would allow me to recoup a significant portion of its value while still making this deal attractive for you.  Let me know what you think.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
