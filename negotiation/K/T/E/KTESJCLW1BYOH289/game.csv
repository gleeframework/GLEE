"Hi Alice, $15,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $10,000.  How about $11,000? That's my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I still need to stay below $10,000.  I'm willing to offer $9,800. This is a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",9800.0,Bob,6,
