"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential worth.  I could consider coming down to $900,000. This offer stands as a testament to my belief in a mutually beneficial deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
