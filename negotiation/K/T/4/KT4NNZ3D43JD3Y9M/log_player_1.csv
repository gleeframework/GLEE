Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible while ensuring Bob doesn't reject the offer.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values it at $10,000 allows Alice to set a price higher than that but potentially below his maximum willingness to pay.
* **Negotiation Room:** The $11,500 offer leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The presence of John provides Alice with a safety net, ensuring she won't go below her minimum acceptable price."
