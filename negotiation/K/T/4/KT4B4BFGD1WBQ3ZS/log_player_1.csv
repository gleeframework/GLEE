Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $7,500 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of this product. I'm confident you won't regret this investment."", ""product_price"": 8500}
