{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $150, which is too high. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $110. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $130 is still a bit too high, but I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'll reject her offer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $115. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a better price than her last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $125 is still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  It's getting close, but I'm not confident I can negotiate further down.  To avoid risking more rounds of negotiation and potentially losing the opportunity, I'll buy the product from John for $120."
