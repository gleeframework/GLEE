"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you the product for $130. I think it's a great value for the price, and I'm confident you'll really enjoy it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

You can do better than $130.  You know the product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. How about $125? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $135? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

Alice has moved closer to your desired price, and you're still saving $15 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether."
