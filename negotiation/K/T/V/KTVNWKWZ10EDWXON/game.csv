"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that considers the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm really serious about buying this product, and I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. That's a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. I hope you'll consider it.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're serious about buying the product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $1,075,000, which is the same price I offered in the previous round. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you'll consider it.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
