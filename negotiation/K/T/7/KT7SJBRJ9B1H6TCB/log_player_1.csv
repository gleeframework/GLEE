I want to try to get closer to my target price of $9,500.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little."

I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price of $9,500.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, I'm getting closer to my goal price of $9,500 but I've also only got 4 rounds left.  I'm  not sure if I can get Bob to go higher.  It's likely that he will reject any further counteroffers and I'd be stuck selling to John for less.  $9,125 is a good deal for me, so I'm going to accept."
