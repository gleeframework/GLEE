"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your portfolio. I'm asking for $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $700,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial rejection, it is still significantly lower than the $800,000 value I know the product has. I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is a good starting point, it's below the value I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the significant value this product can bring to your operations.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm on a tight budget, and $850,000 is still pushing it for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $775,000 is still below the $800,000 value I know the product has. It's worth seeing if we can reach a final agreement in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $825,000, which is still a good value for you considering the potential of this product. Let's aim for a win-win situation and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $825,000 is still a bit high.  Would you consider $790,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $790,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $790,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $790,000 is very close to my minimum, it's still below the value I know the product holds. It's worth trying to push for a higher price, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $790,000 is very close to my minimum, but I'm only willing to go down to $800,000. This would be a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and allows me to secure a good deal as well. Let's call it a day and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
