"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your portfolio. I'm asking for $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is a good starting point, it's below the value I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the significant value this product can bring to your operations.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm on a tight budget, and $850,000 is still pushing it for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to go down to $825,000, which is still a good value for you considering the potential of this product. Let's aim for a win-win situation and finalize this deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  I'm getting closer to my budget, but $825,000 is still a bit high.  Would you consider $790,000? That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's value.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $790,000 is very close to my minimum, but I'm only willing to go down to $800,000. This would be a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and allows me to secure a good deal as well. Let's call it a day and finalize this deal.",800000.0,Alice,7,
