Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to make a significant investment, but I'm not willing to go below $1,100,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,150,000. I think this product has a lot of potential for growth, and I want to make sure I'm getting a fair return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go.

We're now at round 7 and Alice is still significantly above your $1,000,000 fallback option. While you might be able to negotiate her down a bit further, it's unlikely you'll reach a price that makes continuing the negotiation worthwhile compared to John's offer."
