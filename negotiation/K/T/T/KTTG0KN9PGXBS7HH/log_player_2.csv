"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much closer to my maximum budget than her own valuation. I need to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $9,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. Could you meet me halfway at $10,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is negotiating, which is good, but $10,000 is still too high. I'll hold firm for now and see if she's willing to come down further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $10,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,300.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 9300
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you drive a hard bargain! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,650? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting very close, but every dollar counts! I'll push a bit further and see if there's any more room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, you're right, we're close! How about we settle right in the middle at $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise."",
