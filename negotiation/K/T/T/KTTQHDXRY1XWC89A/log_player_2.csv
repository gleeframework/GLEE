"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I propose an initial price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** It's above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds and a potential alternative seller (John). 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to set the terms and potentially save more money.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to propose $1,250,000 as a starting point for our negotiation.  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to move a bit from my initial offer. How about we settle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your ideal price point.**  You're trying to stay under $1,250,000.
* **You have more rounds and a fallback option.**  You can still negotiate and have John as a backup if needed.
* **Rejecting allows you to continue to drive down the price.**  You can make a counteroffer closer to your target price in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
