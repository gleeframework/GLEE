Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I propose an initial price of $1,400,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to propose $1,250,000 as a starting point for our negotiation.  I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to move a bit from my initial offer. How about we settle at $1,350,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
While I could push for more, accepting at $1,300,000 is a solid win. It's a good profit margin above my minimum, and there's always a risk Bob will walk away if I push too hard."
