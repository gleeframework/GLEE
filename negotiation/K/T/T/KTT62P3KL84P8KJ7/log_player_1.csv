"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a decent profit margin, but it's still within a range that Bob might consider if he values the product highly.  I'll see how he responds before adjusting my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if Bob's willing to budge.  There's still a chance to get a better deal with him before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
``` 

I'm offering $125. This is a compromise, halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this shows I'm open to negotiation, but I'm still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $110, which is a decent profit for me considering my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing more rounds and potentially ending up with John's offer of $100.  I'll accept this offer."
