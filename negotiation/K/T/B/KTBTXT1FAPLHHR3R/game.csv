"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $6,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we settle at $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of offering $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, so I hope we can meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,5,
