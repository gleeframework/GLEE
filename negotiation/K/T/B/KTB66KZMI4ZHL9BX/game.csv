,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll get from the product.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $18,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $19,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this offer?",17500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $18,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $17,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this offer?",17000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on this.  I can come down to $18,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the value you're getting.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options.",18000.0,Alice,7,
