"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for the product, considering its potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $1700000 is a good starting point, I need to stay closer to my initial valuation.  I'm willing to come down to $1850000. This reflects the product's unique value and ensures we both benefit from the deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for your flexibility. While I appreciate the lower price, $1850000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's meet in the middle at $1750000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a solid sale. ",1750000.0,Bob,4,
