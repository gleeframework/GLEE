Bob should reject Alice's offer. Although it's closer to his budget, he can still potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,200.

Alice's offer of $11,200 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. It's better for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
