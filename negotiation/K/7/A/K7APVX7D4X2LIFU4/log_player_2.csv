"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still a considerable amount of money.  It shows that you are serious about buying the product but are also trying to secure a good deal. The price is also higher than Alice's own valuation of the product, leaving room for potential compromise."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for you, considering your maximum budget is $1,500,000. You can save $400,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential savings. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product within your budget."
