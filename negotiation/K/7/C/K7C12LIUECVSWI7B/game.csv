"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this number.",880000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $880,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $900,000 to make it worth my while. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
