Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have leverage to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This maximizes potential profit if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Justification:** The message hints at the product's value without overselling it, aiming to pique Bob's interest.
* **Room for Negotiation:** The high price leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. You can then gradually lower the price, aiming to settle closer to $1,000,000 or higher. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have the time and willingness to potentially negotiate with Bob. If you need a quick sale, offering a price closer to $800,000 would be more sensible."
