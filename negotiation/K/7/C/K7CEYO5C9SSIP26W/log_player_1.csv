"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal, considering its value to you! I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair price. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think it's a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I have a backup buyer in John, and I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still aiming for a price closer to the value this product brings you. Let's split the difference: I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm not willing to settle for less, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John for $1,000,000. I'll continue negotiating with Bob to see if I can get him to raise his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. How about $1,025,000? This reflects the value you place on the product and is a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd like to get a better price from Bob, his offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I've already negotiated with Bob for several rounds and it seems he's not willing to go higher.  At this point, it's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
