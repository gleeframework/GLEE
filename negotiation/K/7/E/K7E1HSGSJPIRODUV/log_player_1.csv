""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 925000
}

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You're aware that the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. 
* **Your Minimum:**  Your minimum acceptable price is $800,000 (guaranteed by John's offer).
* **Aiming High:** Starting with an offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($925,000) allows room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and potential benefits to Bob's business justifies the high price.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  You secure a sale significantly above your minimum, maximizing your profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have space to negotiate down towards $800,000 while still aiming for a higher final price.
* **Bob Rejects:** You accept John's offer of $800,000, meeting your minimum acceptable price."
