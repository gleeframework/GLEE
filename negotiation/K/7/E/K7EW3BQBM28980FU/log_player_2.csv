"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer:** $950,000
* **Your value:** $1,000,000
* **John's price:** $1,000,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $50,000 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John's higher price outweighs the potential savings."
