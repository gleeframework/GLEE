# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
