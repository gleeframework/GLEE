I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $925,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can get a better deal. I'm still hopeful that Bob will come up in price to something closer to $950,000. If he doesn't, I'm prepared to sell to John for $1,200,000 in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, it's clear that we're too far apart in our valuations. I don't want to waste any more time negotiating with Bob, as I can secure a much better price by selling to John."
