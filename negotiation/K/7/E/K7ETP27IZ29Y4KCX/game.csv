"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? I believe this price reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway once more and propose $937,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's find common ground and close this deal.",937500.0,Alice,5,
