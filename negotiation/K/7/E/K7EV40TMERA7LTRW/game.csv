"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on something truly unique and valuable.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1500000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1350000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the product's true value, but also takes into account your budget constraints.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1250000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking to stretch your budget as far as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1300000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I can offer you the product for $1290000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1290000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1290000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1290000 and $1200000, which would be $1245000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1245000.0,Bob,6,
