Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $95 is getting closer to your maximum price of $120, but it's still not a good deal.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice is risky, as her offers are increasing, and you might end up paying more than you're comfortable with.  It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $120, ensuring you get the product without exceeding your budget."
