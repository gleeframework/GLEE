"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exceptional opportunity that I believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value to you, I propose a price of $950,000. This offer is exclusive to you and comes with a special package that includes additional services and support. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While it's tempting to go for the ""special package"", it's not worth the extra $150,000.  You can likely negotiate a better price.  It's also important to remember that you have a backup option with John for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the special package, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me, and it allows me to maximize my savings."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your budget constraints. To better align with your financial considerations while still valuing the exclusivity and benefits of our product, I am proposing a revised price of $900,000. This offer includes all the services and support mentioned earlier, and I believe it strikes a balance between our interests. Please let me know if this revised proposal is acceptable, or if there's anything else we can discuss to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than the initial one, it's still above your target price of $800,000.  You still have a better option with John.  Continue negotiating to try and get Alice closer to your price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still outside of my budget. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your continued interest in our product, Bob. After careful consideration, I am prepared to offer you a price of $890,000. This proposal aims to provide a reasonable compromise that respects both your budgetary constraints and the value you see in the product. It includes all the services and support we've discussed, ensuring you receive the full benefits of our offering. Please let me know if this revised price works for you, or if there's anything else I can do to facilitate a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still $90,000 more than what John is offering.  You've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to get you a much better price. It's time to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with.  You've also used up a significant number of rounds.  There's a chance you won't get a better deal with Alice in the remaining rounds."
