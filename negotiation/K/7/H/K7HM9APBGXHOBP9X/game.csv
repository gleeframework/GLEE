,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's aim for a deal that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm encouraged that we're finding common ground.  How about we settle at $1,150,000?  This reflects my willingness to compromise while still acknowledging the product's inherent value.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
