Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering!  $200 is a bit steep for me though. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand $200 might be a bit high, but $60 is too low for me. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about $75? That's a fair offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still too low for me. This product is really worth a lot more. How about we settle at $130? That's a significant price drop on my end."", ""product_price"": 130}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you be willing to meet me at $80? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear that $80 is his absolute limit. While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll go much higher, and we risk him walking away entirely. Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price of $150."
