"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see some more flexibility on the price.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This recognizes the product's value while still providing a discount from my initial offer.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $12,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers.",12800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. While $12,800 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price.  Would you consider $13,000? This feels like a fair point where we both gain.",13000.0,Alice,5,
