"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly at your maximum budget, and you can get the product without any negotiation. While there might be room for negotiating a slightly lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and potentially making a higher counteroffer isn't worth it.  You're already getting the product at your desired price, so accepting the offer is the best decision."
