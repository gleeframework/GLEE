# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and allows you to significantly benefit from its acquisition. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

While Alice's offer of $925,000 is below your $1,000,000 maximum, it's still significantly higher than John's offer. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage John's lower price and potentially negotiate a better deal."
