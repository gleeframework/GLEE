"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to buy it for $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000? I believe that's a fair price that reflects the product's value while remaining feasible for me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent, my absolute limit is $950,000.  If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider my other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to meet you at $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. How about $975,000? This meets us close to the middle and avoids wasting both our time with further negotiation.",975000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable meeting you at $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
