"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $170. I think it's a fair price, given its value. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $170 is too high, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $170 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $130 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $155? That's a good compromise, and it still gives me some wiggle room. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $155 is better than Alice's original offer, Bob can still do better. He should reject and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $155 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145.  I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $145 is closer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference at $147.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $147.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $147.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $147.50 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the product for $120 from John, making that the best option at this point."
