{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate but isn't so high that he'll immediately reject.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for you to make concessions if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This helps to keep the negotiation focused.

This initial offer sets the stage for a productive negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $10,000. It's not worth selling the product at this price. I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll send a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but how about $8,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand where you're coming from.  While I think the product is great, $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my desired price.  I'm not willing to settle for that amount yet. I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $9,000? This price is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
