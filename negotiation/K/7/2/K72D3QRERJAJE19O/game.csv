"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $105? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest! $105 is still a little lower than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference at $110? I think that's fair considering the value you'll get from this product. ",110.0,Alice,3,
