"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great product for the price of $12,000. I believe this product will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is far too high. It's well above your maximum budget and leaves no room for negotiation.  You'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $12,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. It's important to start significantly below your maximum budget to allow room for negotiation and try to understand Alice's lowest acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $6,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While closer to your budget, $9,000 is still above your maximum and leaves limited room for further negotiation. You should counter-offer again, pushing closer to your limit while remaining open to a deal slightly above $8,000 if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $9,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Could you do $7,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

This counteroffer attempts to nudge the price closer to your target while acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate. You're leaving some room for a potential final compromise slightly above your $8,000 limit if Alice is open to it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line.  Would you be willing to consider $8,500? I'm trying to be fair and find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $8,500.  While it's close to your target, you have a guaranteed option with John at $8,000. It makes more sense to buy from John and avoid further negotiation or the risk of Alice not budging."
