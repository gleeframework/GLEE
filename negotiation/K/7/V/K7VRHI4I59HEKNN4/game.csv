"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to own it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it would be a good deal for you as well. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $1,050,000. It's a bit above your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
