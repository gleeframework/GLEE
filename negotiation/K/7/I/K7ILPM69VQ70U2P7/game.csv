"Alice, thanks for the offer. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to save money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,225,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the benefits it will bring to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
