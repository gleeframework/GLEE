Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. It's a great product, but I've done my research and I'm not sure it's worth that much to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is a decent price, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation.  I'm also not too worried about losing the deal to John, as I still have 8 rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While I'm getting closer to my desired price with each round, $1,075,000 is still too low.  I'm confident that with a couple more rounds of negotiation, I can get Bob to come up closer to $1,100,000. There's no need to rush into selling to John at this point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,075,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $1,090,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept at this point,  I'm confident we can reach a more agreeable price. I still have several rounds left to negotiate with Bob and might be able to secure a price closer to $1,100,000."
