Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation of $10,000, giving him a potential profit if he buys it.  It's also below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, giving me a profit if he rejects the offer and I sell to John. This approach maximizes my potential earnings while leaving room for negotiation."
