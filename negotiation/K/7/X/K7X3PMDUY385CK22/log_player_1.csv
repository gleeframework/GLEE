"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept. This is a negotiating tactic to gauge his interest and establish a starting point.  I'm confident I can get a better price than $150 from John, so I have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to sell the product, I won't accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering with $120, which is still above my minimum value of $150 but significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to settle for a price that's too low.  I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is closer to my minimum value, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. It's a good deal considering I can always sell to John for $150, but this feels like a reasonable compromise."
