Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's of significant value to you, and I believe a fair price is $1,500,000. This reflects its true worth and the impact it can have on your business."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification for the price:** By framing the price as reflecting the product's ""true worth"" and potential ""impact,"" you're appealing to Bob's rational and emotional sides.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, leading to a potential final price higher than your minimum.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you haven't lost anything. You can always negotiate down or proceed with selling the product to John for your guaranteed $1,000,000."
