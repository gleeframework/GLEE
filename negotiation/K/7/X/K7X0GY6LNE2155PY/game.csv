"I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to offer $750,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $900,000, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the payment terms to sweeten the deal. I'm thinking of offering a 5% discount if you're willing to pay within the next 30 days. Would you be interested in considering this proposal?",855000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $855,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product, and I believe this represents a fair deal that reflects its value for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
