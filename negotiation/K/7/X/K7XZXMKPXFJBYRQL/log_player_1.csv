{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This offer is time-sensitive as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,100,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but it's still a substantial discount from his alternative options if he needs this product urgently.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept the offer quickly without overthinking it. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation. There's no opportunity to revise the offer based on Bob's response. A higher initial offer increases the risk of losing Bob as a buyer."
