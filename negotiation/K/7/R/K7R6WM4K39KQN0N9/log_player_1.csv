"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $1,700,000 is out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to meet your minimum requirements, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with it. I believe there's room for a higher price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept $1,400,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that reflects both our interests and allows us to close the deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $1,400,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and the value I can get out of it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is getting closer, I'm still holding out for a bit more. There are only a few rounds left, and I want to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to come up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer to a deal. I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1,450,000, but I can't go any lower.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to drop the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,450,000. I'm willing to pay $1,380,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and the value I can get out of it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's clear that Bob and I are not going to be able to agree on a price, and I'm running out of time. It's better to take the guaranteed offer from John than to risk getting a lower price or no deal at all."
