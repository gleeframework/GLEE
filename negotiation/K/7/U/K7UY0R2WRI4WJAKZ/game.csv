"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1 million to you, and I'm confident it will be a game-changer. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $950,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm sure we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider. To demonstrate my commitment to finding common ground, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I'm confident it's a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
