"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm  prepared to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He should continue to negotiate and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Even though Alice has come down slightly in price, she's still above Bob's budget.  There's a good chance that Alice will not budge further, and Bob is likely to continue to reject offers and counteroffer, wasting valuable rounds.  He's already had 4 rounds of negotiations with Alice and John is offering a price within his budget.  It's time to stop negotiating with Alice and go with the sure thing."
