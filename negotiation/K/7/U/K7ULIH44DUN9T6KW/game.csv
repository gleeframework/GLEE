"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm  prepared to pay $8,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",10250.0,Alice,5,
