"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going below $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $9,500. How about we try $10,750? This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
