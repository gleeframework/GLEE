"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum budget and even above her own valuation of the product.  There's plenty of room for negotiation. You should definitely counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for this product."",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While you're willing to pay up to $10,000, it's best to start with a significantly lower offer to give yourself room to negotiate upwards.
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:**  This low offer helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. 

This strategy aims to reach a price closer to your desired range while leaving you the option to increase your offer if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to consider a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  While Alice came down significantly, $12,000 is still above your $10,000 maximum budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Her willingness to meet in the middle suggests there's flexibility in her pricing.

You should counteroffer again, moving closer to your maximum but still leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $9,500?"",
 ""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate upwards, but you're still aiming for a price below your maximum.
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering $9,500 allows you to see how close Alice is willing to get to your $10,000 limit.  

This counteroffer maintains a balance between pursuing a better deal and potentially closing the deal if Alice is amenable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going below $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $9,500. How about we try $10,750? This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Budget:**  Alice's offer of $10,750 is still slightly above your $10,000 maximum.
* **John's Guaranteed Price:** You know John will sell you the product for $10,000.  

At this point, further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to result in a price that's significantly better than John's guaranteed offer. It's time to secure the product at your target price."
