"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $130 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $115. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $115 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about $110?  This would be a good deal for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $112.50. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get it a bit lower.  How about $111?  This would be a good middle ground for us, and get us closer to a deal.",111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $112, but that's as low as I can go. If you're willing to meet me at that price, I'm willing to make a deal.",112.0,Alice,7,
