Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not yet ready to accept it. I want to see if I can push him a little higher in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,340,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's only $10,000 less than my last counteroffer, and it's getting closer to my minimum.  I've got to weigh the risk of losing the deal with Bob against the potential of getting a slightly higher price in a future round. I think it's time to secure the sale."
