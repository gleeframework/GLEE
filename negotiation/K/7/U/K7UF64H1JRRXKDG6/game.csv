"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  This price still reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still working within a specific budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,325,000. I hope this proposal is closer to what you're looking for.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,340,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. Let's find a way to finalize this agreement.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
