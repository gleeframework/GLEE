"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a great price.  I'm asking for $120, which is a fair deal considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested!

We can do better than $120! Let's see if Alice is willing to come down on her price. If not, we can always buy from John for $150."
