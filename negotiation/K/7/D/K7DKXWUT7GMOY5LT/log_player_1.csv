"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the value we both see in this product, I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential value and allows us both to benefit from the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your thoughtful counter-proposal. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial price.  Would you consider $1,275,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product even more accurately."", ""product_price"": 1275000}"
