"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you bringing this product to my attention. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the value we both see in this product, I'd like to propose a price of $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential value and allows us both to benefit from the transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your thoughtful counter-proposal. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I'm aiming for something closer to my initial price.  Would you consider $1,275,000? I believe this reflects the true value of the product even more accurately.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
