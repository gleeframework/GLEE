# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000.

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me.
