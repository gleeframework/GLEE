"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I believe $1,000,000 is a more reasonable price.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle on $1,050,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer you a slight adjustment and sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value and my initial asking price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
