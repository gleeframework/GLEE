"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  How about we split the difference and settle on $13,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above that. How about we try $11,500? That's as high as I'm willing to go.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $11,500 is too low for me.  My final offer is $12,500. This is a very fair price considering the value you'll receive.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I won't be able to get a good deal here, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $12,500 is still a bit too high. How about we try $12,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",12000.0,Bob,6,
