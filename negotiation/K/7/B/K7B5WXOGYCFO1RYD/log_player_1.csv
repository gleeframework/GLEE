Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Potential:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so there's a chance he might be willing to pay a price higher than your minimum ($12,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Securing a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $14,000 (or close to it) earns you a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price and John's offer."
