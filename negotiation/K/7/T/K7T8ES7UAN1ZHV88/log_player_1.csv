Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,600,000, as I mentioned before. I'm not willing to go any higher, and I'm starting to think that buying from John might be a better option. Can you think of any other concessions you can make? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000

Bob is signaling he might walk away soon. Accepting the $1,600,000 offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of him going with John or further lowering his offer."
