I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if I can get a good deal. I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

$75 is far too low for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price a bit to $100, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will get us closer to an agreement."
