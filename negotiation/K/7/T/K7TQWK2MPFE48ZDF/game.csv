"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still quite a bit below my desired price point. This product offers significant potential for return, and I'm confident it's worth the investment. Would you consider $1,425,000?",1425000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,375,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still seeking a slightly higher price.  Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000? I believe this reflects a fair compromise for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
