"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product.  While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  This would still give you a solid profit and allow me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",9200.0,Alice,3,
