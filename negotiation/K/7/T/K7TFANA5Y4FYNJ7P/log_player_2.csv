"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product.  While I'm interested, $9,000 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500.  This would still give you a solid profit and allow me to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,200. This is a fair price, considering the value you place on the product and my original asking price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,200 is still within Bob's budget and closer to his counteroffer of $8,500. It's a better deal than John's offer of $10,000.  While further negotiation could potentially get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice might reject further offers and Bob would have to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures a good deal and finalizes the purchase."
