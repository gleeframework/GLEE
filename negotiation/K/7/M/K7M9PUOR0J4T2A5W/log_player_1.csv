"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for negotiation and potential counteroffers.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value without being overly aggressive. 
 
I'm aiming to secure a deal significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) while acknowledging Bob's potential gain from the purchase."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price given the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, it's still early in the negotiation. I'm confident I can push for a slightly better price. I'm willing to engage in further counter-offering to explore if a higher profit margin is attainable."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,100,000 is a significant sum, I believe the true value of this product sits a bit higher. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,125,000?"",
""product_price"": 1125000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a compromise by splitting the difference between Bob's offer and my previous ask.  This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can help move towards a close.
* **Firm but Fair:**  My message emphasizes the product's value while still showing a willingness to negotiate. I'm aiming to secure a price closer to the higher end of the potential range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. We still have room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can secure a price closer to $1,100,000.  I'll use my next counteroffer to nudge the price upward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I feel strongly that $1,075,000 undervalues the product's potential.  To move this forward, I could accept a price of $1,110,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still providing you with significant value."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm making a smaller concession this round ($15,000) to signal I'm getting closer to my bottom line.  
* **Value Focus:** I'm reiterating the product's value proposition to justify the higher price point.
* **Time Consideration:** As we progress through the rounds, I'm becoming slightly more flexible to avoid missing the opportunity to close a deal with Bob altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still comfortable with my previous offer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to be realistic. Bob seems anchored at $1,075,000 and hasn't budged much. While I'd prefer a higher price, we're getting into the later rounds, and the difference between his offer and my ideal price is getting smaller. 

Accepting at $1,075,000 secures a good profit ($75,000 above my minimum) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away altogether in later rounds."
