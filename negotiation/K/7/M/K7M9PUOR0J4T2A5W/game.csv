"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $1,100,000 is a significant sum, I believe the true value of this product sits a bit higher. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I feel strongly that $1,075,000 undervalues the product's potential.  To move this forward, I could accept a price of $1,110,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while still providing you with significant value.",1110000.0,Alice,5,
