"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to me and still provides you with a substantial profit.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,000,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a tighter budget in mind. Would you consider $600,000? This way, you still get a good deal above what most would offer."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to:

* **Be polite and respectful** to maintain a good negotiating relationship with Alice.
* **Express continued interest** in the product.
* **Present a strong counter-offer** significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Provide a reason for the counter-offer** (""tighter budget"") to make it seem more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which still gives you a good profit margin. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer now matches John's price. There's no point in further negotiation or risking losing the deal to another buyer.  Accept the offer and get the product at your target price."
