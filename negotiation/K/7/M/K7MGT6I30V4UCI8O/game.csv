"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to me and still provides you with a substantial profit.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,000,000 is quite steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a tighter budget in mind. Would you consider $600,000? This way, you still get a good deal above what most would offer.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to go down to $800,000, which still gives you a good profit margin. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision.",800000.0,Alice,3,
