Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I think this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so aiming close to that maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly below Bob's maximum price leaves space for him to counter-offer, potentially reaching an even higher final price. 
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing John provides a guaranteed $1,000,000 gives leverage. We don't need to settle for anything less. 

This strategy aims to secure a price that benefits both parties while prioritizing maximizing your profit."
