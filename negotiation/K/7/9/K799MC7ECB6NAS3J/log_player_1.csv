Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. Offering it at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit.
* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob values the product at $800,000, so a price significantly lower than $1,100,000 might make him suspicious or undervalue the product. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing John will buy the product for my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) gives me leverage. Bob has an incentive to make a deal now rather than risk losing the opportunity."
