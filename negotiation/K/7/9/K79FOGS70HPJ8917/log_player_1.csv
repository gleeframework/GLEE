Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to buy your product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? It's a fair compromise and allows us to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $8,750 is getting closer to my desired price, I think I can still get a little more. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we settle on $8,900? It's a compromise for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let's close this transaction and avoid going back and forth any further."", ""product_price"": 8900}
