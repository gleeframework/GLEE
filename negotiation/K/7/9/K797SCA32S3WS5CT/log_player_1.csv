Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is well above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $800000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.
