"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is well above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $800000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1100000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This price still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still outside my price range.  I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $800000. This allows for a reasonable profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're still far apart on the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking that a price of $1200000 is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my target profit. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to know if it's acceptable to you.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
