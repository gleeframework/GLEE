Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's really worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $180. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 180
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for bargaining if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Justification:** By saying ""I think it's really worth a lot,"" Alice subtly suggests the product might be worth even more than $180, potentially making Bob more agreeable to the offered price.
* **Alternative:**  Alice has a safety net with John, so she can afford to start at a higher price with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob the impression of a fair deal."
