"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is worth at least $1000000 to you. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to resist.",950000.0,Alice,1,
