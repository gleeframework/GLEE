Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You have a strong BATNA because you can sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This gives you leverage.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, which is the same as your fallback price.  You need to incentivize him to buy from you instead of waiting for a potential better deal (which doesn't exist in this scenario).

**Strategy**

Aim high, but be realistic. Since Bob knows the product's value, a ridiculously high price will likely make him walk away. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I know it's something you see value in. I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable Price:** The offer of $1,750,000 aims to secure a significant profit while staying within a potentially acceptable range for Bob.
* **Confident Language:**  The message uses confident language about the product's value to influence Bob's perception. 
* **No Mention of John:**  There's no need to bring up your alternative buyer.  It weakens your negotiating position.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower your initial offer.
* **Relationship Value:** Is there a long-term business relationship with Bob you want to foster? If so, a slightly less aggressive starting point might be wise. 

**Remember, this is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters!**"
