Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's valuation, hoping to get a good deal.  It's a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's better to sell to Bob than to John, as I'm getting the same price."
