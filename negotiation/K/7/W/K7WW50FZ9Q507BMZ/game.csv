"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable offer considering the product's value to you.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This price represents a fair compromise and allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. This price takes into account the product's value to you, but also reflects its worth to me. I'm open to further discussion, but I believe this price is a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still too far from what I'm able to pay. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This offer reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to stay within my budget. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This price reflects a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,025,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  To get this deal done, I'm willing to offer $975,000. This represents a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away with a reasonable outcome. Let's make this happen!",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. Considering the product's value to me and your willingness to negotiate, I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000. This price is a fair compromise that I believe we can both live with.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're almost there. To get this done today, I'm going to offer $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal and both be happy with the outcome.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to me and the effort we've both put into this negotiation, I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,075,000. This price reflects a compromise that I believe is fair and reasonable for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
