"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 
 
I'm going to start with my minimum acceptable price. This is because I have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay that amount, so I'm not under pressure to lower my price immediately. I'm hoping Bob will be interested in the product enough to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,150,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still above Bob's initial offer. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to move closer to my desired price without making me lose too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,075,000 is getting closer to Bob's value of $1,000,000, it's still significantly below my desired price and still a bit far from John's offer. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

I'm going to stick to my strategy of making incremental adjustments. I'm offering $1,125,000, which is still below my initial offer but closer to Bob's last offer.  I'm hoping to meet in the middle and close the deal in the next few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,087,500 is getting closer, I'm still not satisfied with this price. I'm committed to trying to reach a price closer to my desired price before considering selling to John. I'm going to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1112500}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,112,500. This is a smaller adjustment compared to the previous rounds, aiming to signal that I'm willing to come down further but not too quickly. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,096,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,096,875
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,096,875 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a significant distance from my desired price. I'm not willing to settle for that yet and believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1104687} 
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,104,687.  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, and it's getting closer to my desired price.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a deal, but I'm not willing to accept anything significantly lower than my minimum.  We're in the final rounds, and I'm hoping we can reach a consensus."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,359. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,359
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses. While I was hoping to get closer to my minimum price, I'm running out of time and Bob doesn't seem willing to move much further. I'm better off selling to John for $1,200,000 and guaranteeing my minimum profit."
