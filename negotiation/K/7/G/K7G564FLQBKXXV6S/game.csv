"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm interested in it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is higher than $9000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a great price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $11000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $9500. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10000 is a good price for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already compromised a lot, and I think the product's value to you is higher than that. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10200. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",10200.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $10200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be realistic about my budget. I'd like to propose a price of $10000. I'm not willing to go any higher than that.",10000.0,Bob,8,
