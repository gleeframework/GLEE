"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price of $950,000. It's a significant investment, but one that I believe will generate substantial returns for you. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $800,000 for this item. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that suits both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $800,000 simply wouldn't cover my minimum requirements.  I'm willing to compromise, however, and come down to $850,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects the value I place on a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $850,000 is closer to my budget, I still feel it might not fully align with our mutual interests. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $780,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us, considering the value of the product. I look forward to your response.",780000.0,Bob,4,
