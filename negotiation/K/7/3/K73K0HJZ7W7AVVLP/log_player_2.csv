"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's a great value considering its worth to you is also $120. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. Since you can buy the product from John for $120, which is your maximum value for the product, there's no incentive to negotiate with Alice. You'll get the same product for the same price."
