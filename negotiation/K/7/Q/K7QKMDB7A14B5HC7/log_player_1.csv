Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it's still reasonable considering the product's potential value to Bob. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that's significantly below my minimum value. I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial price, but it's still above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit lower than I'd prefer, but it's closer to my minimum value and it's getting increasingly likely that he'll just keep rejecting my offers.  It's time to secure the deal and avoid further haggling."
