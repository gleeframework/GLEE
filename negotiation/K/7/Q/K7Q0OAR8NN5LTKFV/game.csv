"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for a product worth much more than that. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,200, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,500 is a more reasonable price. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest but $10,500 is still too far below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $11,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,800 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll add a bit more to my previous offer. How about $10,900?",10900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,900 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so let's split the difference at $11,000. This will be my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",11000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to pay $11,000. I'm willing to meet you at $10,950, which is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",10950.0,Bob,8,
