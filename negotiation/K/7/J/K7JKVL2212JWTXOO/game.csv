"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep the cost below $8,000. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $8,500? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,
