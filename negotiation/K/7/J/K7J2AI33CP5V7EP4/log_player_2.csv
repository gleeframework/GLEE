"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower.  Since we have 10 rounds, there's time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is within my budget and a reasonable compromise.  It's getting close to my maximum, so it's a good time to accept and avoid further negotiation."
