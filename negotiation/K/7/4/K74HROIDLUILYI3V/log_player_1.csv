Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product, given its value to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but $13,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, as it's less than his perceived value of $15,000. However, it's also closer to my minimum acceptable price and reflects that I'm willing to negotiate but won't settle for anything too far below what I believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $14,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal.  I'm confident that I can get my full asking price of $15,000 from John. There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Bob when I have a guaranteed buyer ready to pay my desired price."
