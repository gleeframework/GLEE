"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  That's a good starting point for me, and hopefully we can work something out from there."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see the value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $17,000 is still too high for Bob's budget. While it's a decrease from the initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum price point.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
