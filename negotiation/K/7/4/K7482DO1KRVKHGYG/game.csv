"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking for $20,000 to start negotiations. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  That's a good starting point for me, and hopefully we can work something out from there.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see the value.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
