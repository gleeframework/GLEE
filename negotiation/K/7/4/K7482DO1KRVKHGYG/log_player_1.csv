Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to consider $10,000?  That's a good starting point for me, and hopefully we can work something out from there. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll see the value."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,500?  I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, the difference between his current offer ($13,500) and John's standing offer ($15,000) is small. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Bob.  Selling to John guarantees the best outcome at this point."
