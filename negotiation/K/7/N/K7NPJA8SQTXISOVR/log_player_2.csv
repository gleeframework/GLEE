"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $11,500. It's a fantastic deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. I'm confident you'll see the value in this. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is overpriced. You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so there's no need to pay $11,500. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might encourage her to propose a lower price."
