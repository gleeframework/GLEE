# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14000, which is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","I would like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $15,000 to her, so I'm sure she's willing to negotiate. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal.
