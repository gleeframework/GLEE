"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise considering both the product's worth and my financial situation.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is too far below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This offer reflects the significant value this product will bring to your operations.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest offer and while I appreciate the reduction, I must respectfully decline. My budget constraints still do not allow me to meet your asking price. I would like to propose an alternative at $1,000,000. I hope this aligns closer with what you're willing to consider.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
