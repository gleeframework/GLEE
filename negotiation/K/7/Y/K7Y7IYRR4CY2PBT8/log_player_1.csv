Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know is worth a lot to you, for a price that is still very fair. Let's discuss a mutually beneficial deal. "", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob while also setting the stage for negotiation. 
* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,150,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my guaranteed backup price with John but still leaves room for negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to Bob's value of $1,200,000. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting high, I have more room to negotiate and potentially get closer to Bob's value.
* **Maintain a positive relationship:** The friendly message helps keep the negotiation process amicable and avoids creating a sense of pressure on Bob. 
* **Ensure a sale:** The backup offer with John provides a safety net, ensuring I won't lose out completely if Bob rejects my initial offer."
