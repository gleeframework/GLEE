"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $10,000 is less than Alice's asking price, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay.  There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer, but it's still a price he's willing to pay.  It's also a significant discount from Alice's initial price, giving her an incentive to negotiate. This initial offer is meant to gauge Alice's willingness to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still not quite within Bob's budget.  There's still some room for negotiation, and Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to show he is willing to negotiate, but he is staying below his maximum price. This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating that he is serious about buying the product while still trying to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob is willing to negotiate further to try and get a lower price, especially since he has 5 rounds left. There is still room for compromise, and Bob might be able to secure a better deal with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, showing a willingness to compromise and get closer to Alice's price. This offer is a step closer to her last offer, demonstrating that he is serious about the deal while still trying to keep the price below his maximum. The remaining rounds offer opportunities for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to Bob's maximum budget.  While there's still a chance Bob could negotiate her down further, the risk of not closing the deal is increasing. With only 3 rounds remaining, it's safer for Bob to buy from John at his guaranteed price of $8,000.  This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
