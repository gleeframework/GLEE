"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it has the potential to be extremely beneficial for your business. I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering its potential value to you.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is simply too low. The value of this product is significant, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you considering its potential.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
