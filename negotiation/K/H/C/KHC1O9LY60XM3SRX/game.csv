"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a significant deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,050,000 is still too high for me.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm only able to offer $900,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $900,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000 is too high, but $975,000 is a more reasonable compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $975,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000.  This is the best I can do, and I'm hopeful you'll consider it.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're firm on $900,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum value. I'm going to take a slightly higher risk and counteroffer at $950,000. This is a bit above your previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still beyond what I can afford.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $900,000. This is truly the best I can do, and I hope we can find a way to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,8,
