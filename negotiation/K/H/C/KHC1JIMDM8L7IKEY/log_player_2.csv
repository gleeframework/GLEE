"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal and worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $120 is too high, and he can get the product from John for $80. It's best to see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my minimum price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $95 is closer to his desired price, he can still get the product from John for $80. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90.  If you're open to that, we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $90 just doesn't quite work for me.  How about $93?  It's a small compromise on both sides, and we can finally close this deal. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $80.  Alice is still offering a price higher than Bob's maximum budget of $80.  While there's a chance Alice may lower her price further, the risk of going through more rounds and potentially ending up with a price higher than $80 is too high.  It's best to take the guaranteed deal with John and save the time and effort."
