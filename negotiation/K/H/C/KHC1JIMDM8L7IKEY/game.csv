"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my minimum price. What do you say?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90.  If you're open to that, we can close the deal.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $90 just doesn't quite work for me.  How about $93?  It's a small compromise on both sides, and we can finally close this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",93.0,Alice,5,
