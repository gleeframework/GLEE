"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum, but not too high to scare Bob off. I'm also being friendly and encouraging to make him feel comfortable negotiating.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is far below my minimum of $120, and I'm not willing to take such a big loss. I'll counteroffer Bob, but I'll keep John in mind as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130.  This is a fair price that takes into account both of our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 
I'm going to counter with $130. It's still a little bit above my minimum of $120, but it shows flexibility and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm also reminding Bob of the value of the product and hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $130 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to keep negotiating. I'll counteroffer Bob again, but I'll keep John in mind as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $100 just doesn't work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  I'm confident you'll find this product is worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm offering $115, which is closer to my minimum of $120. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and hoping to find a compromise. I'm also highlighting my willingness to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $105.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$105 is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer.  I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm starting to get nervous.  I might have to sell to John soon if I don't get a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, but that's my final offer. If this doesn't work for you, I might have to sell to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum with this offer, but I'm also making it clear that I'm running out of patience and might sell to John.  The pressure is on, Bob!"
