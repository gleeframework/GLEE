Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $120. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more. I'm curious to see if Bob is willing to pay this price or if he'll counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.  I'm still hoping to earn more than $120, so I'll see if I can reach a compromise with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering with $130. It's still higher than my minimum, but I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob. This price shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on his $100 offer, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. While I could continue to negotiate, it seems unlikely I'll be able to get a better price from him. To avoid further time and effort, I'll choose to sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I get a price that is at least my minimum and allows me to move on."
