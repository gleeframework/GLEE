It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further.  You can potentially save another $100,000."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could try to negotiate further, at this point Alice has come down to $1,080,000.  You can save $20,000 by accepting her offer, which is a decent amount but unlikely to be significantly better with further negotiation."
