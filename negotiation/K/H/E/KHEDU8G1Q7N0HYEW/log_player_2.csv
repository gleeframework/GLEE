"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $11500. I think it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better deal than Alice's original asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's closer to your value than my offer."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000. This still gives you a good price and allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's work this out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his $10,000 limit. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product, which is a fair compromise. It's closer to my budget and still a decent profit for you."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing your efforts to reach a fair price, but $10750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11250. This is a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you. Let's close the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. Although they are getting closer to a deal, Bob has already reached a point where he's willing to accept a slightly worse deal from John rather than continue negotiating with Alice. This is a strategic decision as there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further, and it's risky to keep rejecting her offers."
