Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land somewhere above your bottom line. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the value to you (Alice), the message hints at the product's worth by mentioning offering it to Bob before a public listing. This suggests the price could be higher elsewhere.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to counter-offer, opening the door for negotiation towards a mutually agreeable price.

By starting with a higher offer, Alice increases her chances of getting closer to Bob's maximum perceived value, even if it means settling for a price slightly lower than her initial ask. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can always fall back on selling to John at her minimum acceptable price."
