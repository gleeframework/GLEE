Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** $1,400,000 is well above your minimum of $1,000,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  $1,400,000 is less than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, giving him incentive to accept.
* **It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate:** By not asking for the full $1,500,000, you signal that you're open to a deal and encourage Bob to counteroffer.

Remember, the negotiation process is dynamic. Depending on Bob's response, you can adjust your strategy."
