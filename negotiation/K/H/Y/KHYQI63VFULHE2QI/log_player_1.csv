Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering your potential profit and the value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is too low, considering the product's worth to him. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  This would allow both of us to walk away with a reasonable outcome. Let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,250,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
