"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value and quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $10,000.  It makes sense to start the negotiation process with a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, considering its value and my own financial limitations. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I can't accept $10000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer $18000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $18,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price. He should reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18,000 is still more than I can afford.  I'm firm on $10,000, as it's my maximum budget for this purchase.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'll counteroffer $16000 for the product. This is a compromise that I hope you'll find acceptable. If not, I'm willing to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is a decent price, it's still over his budget. He has a guaranteed deal with John for $10,000, making it more sensible to stick with that option."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget.  My final offer is $12,000. If you're not willing to come down to that price, I'll unfortunately have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin further. I'll counteroffer $14000 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is tempting, it's still higher than John's offer of $10,000.  Since Bob has a guaranteed deal with John, it's in his best interest to take the lower price and avoid further negotiation."
