"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth at least $1,200,000 to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This gives you a significant advantage while still allowing me to earn a substantial return.  Let me know your thoughts. ",1100000.0,Alice,1,
