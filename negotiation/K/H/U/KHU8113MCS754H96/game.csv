"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a fair agreement. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $13,250 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a good compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,
