I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters and also signals that I believe the product is valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

Bob's offer:
