Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above the value of the product to Bob. I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $10,000. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $10,000. While Bob's offer of $9,800 is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below it.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, it's the most sensible option to guarantee a sale at a price I'm comfortable with."
