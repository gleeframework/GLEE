Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,200,000. To make this a swift deal, I'm willing to offer it at $1,150,000. This is a unique chance to acquire it at a discount. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  While I know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, I want to maximize my profit. Starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value gives me room to negotiate if needed. 
* **Sense of Urgency and Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob and presents my offer as a limited-time opportunity.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering it slightly below Bob's value, I signal that I'm open to negotiation but still aiming for a significant profit."
