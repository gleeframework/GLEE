"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000. This is a fantastic deal for something that will benefit you greatly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, you can do better. Alice is clearly motivated to sell. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get her to come down closer to her $8,000 valuation in a subsequent negotiation."
