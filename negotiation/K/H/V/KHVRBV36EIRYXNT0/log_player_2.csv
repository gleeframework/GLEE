"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth at least $8,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be just as valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,500. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. If not, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency by mentioning another buyer, but her offer of $8,500 is higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting her offer, you can see if she'll come down in price or simply proceed to buy from John at your desired price point."
