{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John). 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation maximizes your profit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.

By offering the product at $1,300,000, you leave room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit margin above your minimum."
