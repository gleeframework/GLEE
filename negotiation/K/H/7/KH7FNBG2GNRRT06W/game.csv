"I appreciate your time, Alice. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth around $12,500 to me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $12,500 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? It's still a good deal for both of us.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,750 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $12,750 is still a little below my minimum. Let's split the difference again - I'll accept $13,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll get great value from the product.",13000.0,Alice,5,
