"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm proposing a starting price of $15,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I've done some research and I believe the product is worth around that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer matches John's offer.  There's no point in continuing negotiations with Bob since my minimum acceptable price is $12,000. I can secure the sale immediately with John."
