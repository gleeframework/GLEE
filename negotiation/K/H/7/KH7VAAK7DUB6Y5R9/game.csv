"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for it, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. Let me know what you think!",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?  This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let me know what you think!",11750.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think!",11200.0,Bob,4,
