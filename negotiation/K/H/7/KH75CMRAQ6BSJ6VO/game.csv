"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm prepared to offer you $1,250,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,250,000. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
