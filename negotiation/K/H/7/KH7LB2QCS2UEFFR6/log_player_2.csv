Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $750,000 is too low, I'm willing to move a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see that we're getting closer on the price. While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is higher.  Would you consider $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,100,000.  You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
