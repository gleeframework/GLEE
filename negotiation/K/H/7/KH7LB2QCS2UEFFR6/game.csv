"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $1,500,000 is too high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $750,000.  What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $750,000 is too low, I'm willing to move a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $900,000? ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see that we're getting closer on the price. While $900,000 is a tempting offer, I believe the true value of this product is higher.  Would you consider $1,100,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
