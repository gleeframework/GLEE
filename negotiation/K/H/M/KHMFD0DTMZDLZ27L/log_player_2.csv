Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $155 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $110, but I can see that you're serious about the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $155, so I'll offer it to you for $132.50. It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Explanation:  While Alice is coming down on the price, she's still significantly above your $120 limit. It's unlikely she'll reach a price you find acceptable within the remaining rounds. John offers a guaranteed price that meets your needs."
