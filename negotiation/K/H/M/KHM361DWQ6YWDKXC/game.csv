"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I believe I can offer you a fair price that respects both our interests.

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $16000 price point. Considering the product's value to me is at least $15000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $18500. This is a fair compromise that still respects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your budget and potential value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18500.0,Alice,3,

This is a final compromise that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to both of us.
