Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, which means aiming for a price closer to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation. However, being too aggressive could make Bob reject the offer.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:**  The message is clear and highlights the product's value to Bob.
* **Strong but Justifiable Price:** $1,400,000 leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal ($100,000 below his valuation) while giving you a substantial profit margin.
* **Confidence:** By stating you believe it's a fair deal, you project confidence in your offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,375,000) to allow room for negotiation. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a strong relationship with Bob is paramount, a slightly less aggressive offer might be preferable.

**Remember:**  This is just one offer strategy. You can adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob and your risk tolerance."
