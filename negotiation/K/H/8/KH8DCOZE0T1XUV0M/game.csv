"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a price closer to $750,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Alice,5,
