"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I've set the price at $14,000, reflecting its significant value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $14,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a lower price range. $12,000 is well below Alice's asking price, but still above her minimum value. This sets the stage for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $12,000 is a significant undervaluation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a better deal than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's desired price range. By rejecting, Bob can continue negotiating and try to get closer to his target price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $13,000 is closer,  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to pay $12,500. Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a small concession, moving up from $12,000 to $12,500. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while staying firm in his price range. This also puts the ball back in Alice's court, allowing her to decide if she wants to accept or counter."
