"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the product's performance. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's true value to you, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is now offering the product for $825,000.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $1,500,000.

Alice's offer is significantly lower than John's price and still within Bob's budget.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $675,000 compared to buying from John.  While there is still some room for negotiation, the potential savings from accepting the offer outweigh the risk of rejecting and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
