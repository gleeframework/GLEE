"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for countering. I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $7,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $8,200. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
