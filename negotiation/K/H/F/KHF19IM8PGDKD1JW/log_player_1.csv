Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's appealing to Bob (so he accepts) but also maximizes your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be a bit bolder.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I believe this represents a fair offer for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message frames the offer as valuable and exclusive.
* **High Anchor:**  $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It's closer to your minimum but leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight discount if he negotiates.
* **Justification:** While brief, mentioning ""fairness"" provides a basis for the price.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,350,000).
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a less aggressive starting point might be preferable.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to negotiate further."
