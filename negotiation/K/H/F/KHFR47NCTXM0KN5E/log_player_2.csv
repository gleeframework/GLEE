"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product for $9000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's better than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's room for negotiation, as Alice likely wants to sell the product and her value ($8,000) is lower than your maximum. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** By rejecting, you signal your willingness to negotiate and can potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8750. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice's counteroffer of $8,750 is a good compromise, splitting the difference between your previous offer and her original price. 
* **Saving Money:** This price is significantly lower than John's offer, saving you $1,250.
* **Limited Downward Potential:** There's not much room for further negotiation;  you're already at a price close to Alice's minimum."
