"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $120.  It's worth every penny and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. The product is only worth $100 to me, so I'll try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a strong starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but still gives room for negotiation.  It also signals that I'm serious about buying the product if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? That would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

Alice has met my maximum price. There's no point in negotiating further or risking losing the deal to John."
