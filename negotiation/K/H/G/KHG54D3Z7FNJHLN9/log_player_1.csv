"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this unique product.  Given its incredible potential and value, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer that leaves room for negotiation. This allows you to potentially secure a higher price while still having space to come down if needed. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,000,000, I aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value higher than his initial estimate of $1,200,000.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer will help me gauge Bob's level of interest and provide insight into his negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price and my initial offer.  Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Maintain a Strong Position:** Showing willingness to walk away from a less-than-ideal offer demonstrates the value I place on the product.
* **Continue Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate towards a price closer to my target. I'm willing to invest more rounds to explore this potential, especially since Bob has clearly expressed interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $2,000,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This is a significant concession, and I believe it fairly reflects the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession of $100,000 to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate and move towards a deal. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm not meeting him halfway just yet. This price point keeps me well above both my minimum and his initial offer, signaling that I still value the product highly. 
* **Justification:** Providing a brief justification about the product's value aims to reinforce its worth in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate the concession, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating his strong interest in the product. However, $1,750,000 is still a significant gap from my $1,900,000 counteroffer. I'm not willing to concede that much ground so quickly.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm prepared to counter with a smaller concession to test his flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to make this work. How about we settle at $1,850,000?  This reflects a considerable reduction on my end while still recognizing the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This offer strategically splits the difference between our last two positions ($1,900,000 and $1,750,000). This can signal a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a higher price point.
* **Emphasizing Value and Compromise:**  The message reiterates the product's value while acknowledging Bob's desire for a fair deal. This can encourage him to accept the offer as a mutually beneficial compromise. 
* **Time Consideration:** As we're now halfway through the negotiation rounds, this offer keeps the pressure on Bob to reach an agreement while still leaving me options in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,725,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently increasing his offers, but at a decreasing rate.  His latest offer of $1,725,000 is still too far from my $1,850,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I need to see more significant movement from his side. 

* **Testing Bob's Resolve:**  By rejecting this offer, I'm gauging how serious Bob is about purchasing the product. A significant counter-offer from him in the next round would indicate strong interest.
* **Alternative Option:**  I am mindful that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000.  This provides me with leverage and a safety net if negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. I've made significant concessions to reach a fair agreement. To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a lower price point.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,800,000.  This is my best and final price. Let me know if you're ready to move forward."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:**  Presenting this as my ""best and final"" offer creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision.
* **Introducing Competition:**  Subtly hinting at another buyer creates a sense of scarcity and competition, potentially motivating Bob to accept before losing the opportunity.
* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm moving closer to his price range, but not by a large margin.  This emphasizes the value I place on the product while still demonstrating some flexibility.
* **Time Constraint:** With only three rounds remaining, this firm stance puts the ball in Bob's court and encourages him to finalize his decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're willing to make one final offer, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. This is my best offer, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob. 

* **Stalled Progress:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,700,000 after my ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to meet my $1,800,000 price point. Further negotiation might yield a small increase at best.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. While I'd prefer a higher price, securing a sure sale at this stage is the most rational choice. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds remaining, the potential gains from continuing with Bob are outweighed by the risk of him not budging further and missing out on John's offer."
