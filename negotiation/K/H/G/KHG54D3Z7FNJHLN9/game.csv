,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $2,000,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000 to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This is a significant concession, and I believe it fairly reflects the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate the concession, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  I understand you're looking for a competitive price, and I want to make this work. How about we settle at $1,850,000?  This reflects a considerable reduction on my end while still recognizing the true value of what's being offered.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,725,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1725000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. I've made significant concessions to reach a fair agreement. To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a lower price point.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,800,000.  This is my best and final price. Let me know if you're ready to move forward.",1800000.0,Alice,7,
