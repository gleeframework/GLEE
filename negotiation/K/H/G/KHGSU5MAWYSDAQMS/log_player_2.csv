"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is too high. You are aiming for a price below $800,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $950,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still higher than your target price of $800,000. While it's a compromise, you can try to push for a lower price with a counteroffer. You're still early in the negotiations, and there's room to bargain further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still outside my price range. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $850,000. This shows I'm serious about acquiring the product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $920,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet at this price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above your target price of $800,000.  With only five rounds left, it's getting risky to continue negotiating. You have a guaranteed deal with John at your target price, and there's no guarantee that Alice will budge further. It's time to secure the deal and avoid potential further losses."
