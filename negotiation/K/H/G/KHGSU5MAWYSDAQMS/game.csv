"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $950,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $950,000 is still outside my price range. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $850,000. This shows I'm serious about acquiring the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $920,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can meet at this price point.",920000.0,Alice,5,
