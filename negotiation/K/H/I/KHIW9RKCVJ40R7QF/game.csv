"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit low for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value to you, while also being reasonable considering my minimum price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
