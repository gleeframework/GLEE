# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit low for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price.
