"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. Let's start with a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is high-quality, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we start the negotiations at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the quality it offers. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $13,500 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly settle on $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to meet you at $12,800, which is a compromise that's closer to my target price. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the quality it offers. What do you think?",12800.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter-offer.  To be completely honest, I'm finding a similar product elsewhere for $12,000. If you're able to come down to that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you've found a similar product elsewhere, but I'm confident that this product has unique features that set it apart. I'm willing to meet you at $12,200, but that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,7,
