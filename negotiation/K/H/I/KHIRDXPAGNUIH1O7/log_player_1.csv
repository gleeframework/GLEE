"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. Let's start with a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is high-quality, $15,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we start the negotiations at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $13,500 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly settle on $11,500? I think that's a fair compromise.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
