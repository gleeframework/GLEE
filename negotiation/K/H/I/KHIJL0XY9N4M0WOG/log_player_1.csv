Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and get a sale quickly,  $800,000 is too far below my minimum value. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
