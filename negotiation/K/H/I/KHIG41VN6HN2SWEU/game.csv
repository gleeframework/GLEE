"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $9,000 is a bit high for me right now.  How about we start at $8,500?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8,750 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,625.  It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",8625.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you halfway again, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,625. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,750 was my previous best offer, but I can do $8,700. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8700.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $8,700 is closer, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's try $8,650.  This is a fair middle ground and would allow us to close the deal.",8650.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,650. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750 was my previous best offer, but I can do $8,725. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8725.0,Alice,7,
