"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $9000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $7500 for the product.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to counter with an offer of $8200. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's worth while being more in line with your budget.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still looking to keep my costs down. Would you consider lowering the price to $8000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to keep costs down, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8000. I've already compromised by offering $8200 earlier, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Considering the product's value to you, I'd like to counter with an offer of $8400. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",8400.0,Alice,5,
