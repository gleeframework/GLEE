Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit above your minimum. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited-time offer"" adds a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** If Bob counters, be prepared to negotiate. You know your walk-away price is $15,000."
