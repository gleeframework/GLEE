"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $17,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested, but I'd need to see it closer to $14,000. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $15,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,250?  I'm confident we can make this work if we're both willing to compromise a bit.",15250.0,Bob,4,
