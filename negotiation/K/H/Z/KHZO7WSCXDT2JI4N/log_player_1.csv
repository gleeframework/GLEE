Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $100. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $80, so $100 is still attractive to him.
* **It's below your minimum:** You value the product at $120, so you're already making a concession. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still lower the price slightly to reach a compromise. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $60. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $60 is better than nothing, it's far below your minimum value of $120 and even below Bob's initial assessment of $80.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to a price that's more favorable for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to at least get $85 for it.  Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer Higher Than Bob's:**  $85 is still below what you initially offered, showing flexibility, but it's significantly higher than Bob's last offer.
* **Reasoning Provided:**  The message justifies the counteroffer, making it less likely Bob will feel like you're just being stubborn.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends by explicitly saying you're open to further discussion, keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $70 is closer to your minimum, it's still not a great deal for you, considering your minimum is $120. Additionally, it's a bit below Bob's initial assessment of $80, which means you might be able to squeeze a bit more out of him.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we meet in the middle at $75? It's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:**  $75 is exactly halfway between your previous offer of $85 and Bob's current offer of $70. This demonstrates your willingness to compromise and reach a middle ground.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message focuses on the positive aspects of the deal: fairness for both parties and keeping the deal moving forward.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  The ending question encourages Bob to respond and keeps the negotiation active."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $72. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $72
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $72 is a slightly better offer than the previous rounds, it's still significantly below your minimum value of $120 and  even below Bob's initial assessment of $80. At this point, continuing to negotiate with Bob will likely only waste time and energy.  It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John and move on."
