"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $10,000, which is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport and increase the chances of a deal. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm not being too aggressive, leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer.

**Important Note:** I'm aiming for a good compromise, but I'm also aware of John's offer. If negotiations stall or Bob's counteroffers are too low, I'll switch to John to ensure I get at least my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I have several rounds left to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to find a middle ground.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you showing interest. While $6,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $8,500?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving towards Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum.  $8,500 is a reasonable middle ground.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Open to further negotiation:**  I'm using language that indicates I'm open to continue negotiating if necessary.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where Bob is willing to pay a price that's good for me while still allowing for potential future concessions if needed. I'm keeping John's offer in mind, and I'm prepared to walk away if Bob's offers don't get close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $7,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **More negotiation time:** I have several more rounds to try and reach a more favorable price. Rejecting allows me to counter and potentially close the gap.
* **John's offer is secure:** I can always sell to John for $12,000, so I'm not pressured to accept a deal that's too low for me. 

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to counter with a price that's closer to my desired range, but I'm prepared to walk away if Bob's offers don't improve significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm reducing my price to $8,000, showing I'm willing to compromise. This is a good compromise, as it's still within my minimum acceptable range.
* **Emphasis on fair price and compromise:** I'm highlighting that this price is fair and beneficial for both parties, increasing the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Enthusiastic tone:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to close the deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a quick and mutually agreeable deal. If Bob rejects this offer, I might be willing to come down to $7,500 in the next round but will likely switch to John if the deal doesn't move forward."
