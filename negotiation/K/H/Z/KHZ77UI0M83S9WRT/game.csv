"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a special price of $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and a significant savings from what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 just isn't viable for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  I need to get at least $1,000,000 for this.  It's still a significant savings for you, and it allows us to both walk away satisfied.  Let's make this happen!",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which represents a substantial saving for you and a fair price for me.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product, but I'm still unable to accept $900,000.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This represents a significant savings for you, and allows us to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Let's work together to finalize this deal!",950000.0,Alice,5,
