Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $850,000 is far too low, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a higher offer in the next round."

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer. I want to see if I can push him a little higher before selling to John."
