"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $180. Let me know what you think!",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go up to $60.  Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately far below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $120. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's the highest I can go.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, I'm afraid $100 is still beyond my budget. If you're able to meet my final offer of $80, I'm ready to buy. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",80.0,Bob,6,
