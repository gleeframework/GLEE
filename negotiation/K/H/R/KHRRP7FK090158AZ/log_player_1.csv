"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $180. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only go up to $60.  Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far too low, and I'm not willing to accept it. I will try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately far below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $120. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $150. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, I'm afraid $100 is still beyond my budget. If you're able to meet my final offer of $80, I'm ready to buy. Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold, and we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation.  I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  John is a guaranteed buyer at a price I'm comfortable with."
