While we could continue negotiating, Bob is now getting very close to our desired price point. Accepting his offer of $1,950,000 ensures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds.  It's always possible to get a bit more, but the certainty of this deal makes it the most logical choice now."
