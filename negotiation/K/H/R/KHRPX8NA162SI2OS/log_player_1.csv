Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is a starting point.  I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  However, I'm also aware that Bob might not be willing to pay that much.  I'll be ready to adjust my offer based on his response and my assessment of his perceived value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's potential for a higher price.  I'll counteroffer to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to try to split the difference with Bob.  $12,000 is a good compromise, and I'm hoping he'll see the value in my product and accept."
