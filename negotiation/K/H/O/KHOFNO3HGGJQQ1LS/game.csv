"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? This would still allow me to make a fair profit and I believe it's a reasonable price for the value this product offers.",17500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $17500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $16000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Bob,4,
