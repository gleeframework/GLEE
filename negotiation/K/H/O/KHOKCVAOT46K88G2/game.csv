Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. What do you think?,180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $120. Would you be willing to come down to $130? ",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. How about we meet in the middle at $155? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $155 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably spend.  How about $140?  That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my budget.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $145? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to sweeten the pot. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
