Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you have room to start higher with Bob.  
* **Justification:** The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth a premium.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $20,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and open tone encourages a positive response and negotiation."
