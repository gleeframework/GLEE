"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $1250000. This is the highest price I'm willing to pay for the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, but I need to get closer to the value the product holds for you. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.
