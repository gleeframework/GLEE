"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $8,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,4,
