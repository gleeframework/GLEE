"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $16500, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $16500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15500. It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal!",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway! However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $15500. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you $16000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $15500.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it. ",15500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer of $15500, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer you $16200. It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16200.0,Alice,7,
