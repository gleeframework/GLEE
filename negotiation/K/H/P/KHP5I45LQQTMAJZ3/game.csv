"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within your budget, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down to $10,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it. It's a good deal for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down again.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,750.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",9750.0,Bob,6,
