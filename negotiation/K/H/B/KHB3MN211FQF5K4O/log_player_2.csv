Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit on the price, but $60 just doesn't work for me.  I understand your budget, but the product is worth a lot more.  How about we meet in the middle at $100?  That's still a good deal for you, and it lets me make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $75 is still too low for me. It's clear we're both trying to find a fair price, so how about we compromise at $90?  That's a good middle ground, and it gives us both something to work with. What do you say?

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll reach my $80 limit. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed deal from John."
