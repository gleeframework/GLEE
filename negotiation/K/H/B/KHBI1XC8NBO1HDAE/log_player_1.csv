"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,800,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows us both to make a good deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. However,  $1,400,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential for your business. I'm confident that it can generate much more value for you in the long run. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,700,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant investment for me and demonstrates my interest in acquiring the product. Let's find a way to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""

``` 

While I could hold out for a higher price, Bob reaching $1,500,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.  It's a fair deal at this point and avoids the risk of further negotiation or him walking away."
