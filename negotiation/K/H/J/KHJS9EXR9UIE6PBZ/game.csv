"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000 for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise that still gives me a good profit, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to reach a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down in price.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Let's split the difference and go with $1,000,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a price of $1,025,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise that still gives me a good profit, but also shows I'm willing to work with you to reach a deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
