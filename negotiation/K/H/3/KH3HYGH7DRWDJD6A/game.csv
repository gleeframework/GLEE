"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $180 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only do $140 right now. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,160.0
"I understand that $140 is a bit tight for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $160, which is a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to go up to $150. This is my final offer.",150.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"I'm glad you're willing to go up to $150, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. I think the product is worth more than that. I can meet you at $155, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,,
