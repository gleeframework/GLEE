"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is better than my minimum, I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob. I'm rejecting his offer and will counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum of $800,000.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. While I'd love to get more, Bob's offer is my minimum and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation. Accepting ensures I get my minimum and avoids risking further negotiation."
