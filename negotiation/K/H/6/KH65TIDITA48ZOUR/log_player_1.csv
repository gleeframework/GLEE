I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counters.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum value of $1,500,000 as possible while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still above my minimum value. I hope this price is enticing enough for Bob to consider while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low, but I'm getting closer to my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and try one more counteroffer before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm going to counter at $1,600,000. This is a further concession from my previous offer, and it's just above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it.  If he doesn't, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but I'm running out of time and negotiation room. I'm better off selling to John at this point and securing my minimum value."
