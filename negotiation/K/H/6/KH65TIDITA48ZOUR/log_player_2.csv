"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some flexibility by lowering her price from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000.  This suggests that further negotiation is possible.  Offering $1,250,000  is a reasonable compromise that still keeps you within your budget. This counteroffer is likely to be more appealing to Alice than your previous offer of $1,000,000,  while still offering a significant discount from her current offer."
