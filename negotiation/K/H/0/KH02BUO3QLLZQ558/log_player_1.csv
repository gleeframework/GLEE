{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate if necessary. I'm also being friendly and optimistic to encourage a positive response. If Bob rejects, I'll then analyze his counteroffer and decide if I want to continue negotiating or simply sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000).  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low price.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,250? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12250}
