{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe is very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $130.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum ($100), but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to maximize my profits, but also want to ensure Bob feels the deal is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $130. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is more than my minimum, it's still below what I'd like to get. I'm willing to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $125, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $122 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $122
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $122 is close to my desired range and still significantly more than selling to John.  It's time to close the deal."
