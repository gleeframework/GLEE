"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I really appreciate the enthusiasm, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to consider a price closer to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $13,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $10,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm not comfortable meeting you halfway at $10,500. I can do $11,500, which is still a good compromise for both of us. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
