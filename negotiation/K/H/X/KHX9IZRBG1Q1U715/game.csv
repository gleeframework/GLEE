"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay closer to my original price.  How about $1,100,000? That's still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a profit.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,050,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
