"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering the product for $1,050,000.  This would still allow you to gain significant value from the product, and it's a fair price given its unique capabilities.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
