"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount of money, and I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth that much more than what I'm offering.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I still believe the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1600000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good investment.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $1500000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
