"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's too early to accept this offer.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows you to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $12,000 is higher than I'm comfortable paying.  Considering its value to me, I'm willing to offer $8,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price, reflecting my budget and the fact that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reasoning:** My message emphasizes that the price is high for me while also showing interest in the product. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  $8,500 leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Alice will counter with a price closer to my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this product. I'm going to counter with $10,500. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $10,500 is still higher than my budget of $8,000.  While it shows some willingness to compromise, it's still too high for me to accept. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $9,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's try to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm increasing my offer by $500, showing that I'm willing to move closer to Alice's position.
* **Fairness:** My message emphasizes that $9,000 is a fair price, considering both my budget and the value of the product.
* **Bridging the Gap:** I explicitly call for bridging the gap, signaling my desire to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm going to counter with $10,000. It's a fair price, and I think it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Even though Alice is moving closer to my price, $10,000 is still higher than my budget of $8,000. 
* **Opportunity for Compromise:** I believe there is still room for Alice to come down further, especially since she's indicating a desire for a compromise.
* **John's Offer:**  I am aware of John's offer of $8,000, which gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Alice fail.  However, I'm still willing to try to get a better deal with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $9,500.  This represents a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given our both our needs.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** I'm increasing my offer to $9,500, which is very close to my maximum budget.  This shows that I'm serious about closing the deal.
* **Emphasis on Compromise:**  I'm highlighting my willingness to compromise and stating that this offer is fair considering both our needs.
* **Finality:**  I'm using language like ""finalize the deal"" to put pressure on Alice to accept."
