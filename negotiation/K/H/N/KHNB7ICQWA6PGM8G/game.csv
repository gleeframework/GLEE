"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $10,500? That leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,500.  Would that be feasible?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $10,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,
