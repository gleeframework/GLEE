"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit below my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110? I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $110 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $120 for it. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at this price?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

I'm still trying to get a price closer to my minimum, but I'm showing flexibility by lowering my offer. Hopefully, this will convince Bob to come up a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $120 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but I'm still interested in the product. Would you be willing to consider a price of $115? I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm not ready to give up on getting closer to my desired price and will continue negotiating. I'll counter Bob's offer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $115 is still below my minimum. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell it to you for $117.50.  This is my final offer.  If you don't accept, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 117.50} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still above my minimum. This is a clear signal that I'm nearing my limit, but still open to a deal. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to accept, as it's a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to split the difference, but $117.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $112 for the product. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where I'm not comfortable going any lower than my minimum.  Bob's offer is still too low for me, and I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles.  It's time to move on to a more promising buyer.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so selling to him is the best option at this point."
