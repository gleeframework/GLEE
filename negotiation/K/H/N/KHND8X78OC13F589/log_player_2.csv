"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $150 to you, and John is offering it at that price, it's the most logical choice. There's no reason to engage in negotiation with Alice when you can get the product at your maximum price point immediately."
