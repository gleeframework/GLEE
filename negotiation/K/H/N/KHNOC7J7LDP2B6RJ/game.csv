"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, the $600,000 price point is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while still allowing for a profitable outcome for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm able to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I feel this is a fair offer considering the market and the product's benefits.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's benefits.  However, $1,200,000 is still too far below my bottom line. I could consider a price of $1,550,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the true value of what's being offered.  Let me know if this works for you.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further and offer you $1,300,000. This is a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product. Let me know if this proposal works for you. ",1300000.0,Bob,6,
