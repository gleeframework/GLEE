"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** My initial offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price and even below my maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:** While I'm aiming to pay much less, my offer shows I'm serious about purchasing the product.
* **Respectful Tone:**  Maintaining a positive and respectful tone is important for a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I appreciate your offer, the $600,000 price point is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while still allowing for a profitable outcome for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  $1,800,000 is far above my maximum budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice came down significantly from her initial offer, indicating she's willing to negotiate. There's still potential to reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm able to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I feel this is a fair offer considering the market and the product's benefits."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting a price exactly between our previous offers, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find common ground. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer (""market and the product's benefits""), which could encourage Alice to consider it more seriously. 
* **Still Below Max:**  Importantly, this offer keeps me well below my maximum budget, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's benefits.  However, $1,200,000 is still too far below my bottom line. I could consider a price of $1,550,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the true value of what's being offered.  Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:** Alice is slowly approaching a more reasonable range, but $1,550,000 is still above my absolute limit.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could potentially negotiate a bit further, the gains are becoming smaller and the risk of Alice ending the negotiation is increasing. It might be time to seriously consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility.  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further and offer you $1,300,000. This is a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product. Let me know if this proposal works for you. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** I'm making one more substantial move towards Alice's price to see if we can close the deal. 
* **Justification:** I'm re-emphasizing the significance of this purchase for me and my belief in the product's value. 
* **Near the Limit:**  This offer is getting very close to my absolute maximum budget. If Alice rejects it, I'll likely purchase from John."
