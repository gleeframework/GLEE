"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, however, $650,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I could consider $975,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $975,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  Could you meet me in the middle at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but $800,000 is  below the minimum I can accept. I'm willing to make one final concession at $900,000. This is my best and final offer, as I have another interested buyer.",900000.0,Alice,5,
