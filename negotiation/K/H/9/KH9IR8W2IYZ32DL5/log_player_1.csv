Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob.
* **Testing the waters:**  This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  The high price leaves space for negotiation if Bob counters.  I can gradually lower the price, aiming for the highest possible profit above my minimum acceptable price.

**Important:** This strategy assumes I have the ability to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower the price if he initially rejects the offer."
