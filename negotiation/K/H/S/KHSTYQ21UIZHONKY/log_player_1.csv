{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be really valuable to you.  I'm asking $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a bit lower than my minimum price of $15,000, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate and incentivizes him to make a counteroffer.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000 and is also far less than the $12,000 I offered initially.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to accept such a low price.  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $11,000 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000, but I'm still holding firm on my minimum price. I'm hoping this counteroffer will encourage Bob to come up a bit more, but I'm prepared to go back and forth a few more times if necessary. I'm also mindful of the fact that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if this negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, so how about $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $10,000, which is closer to my desired price than his previous offer. While it's still less than my minimum of $15,000, it's a good compromise that allows me to make a sale without having to risk losing a buyer entirely.  I'll accept his offer."
