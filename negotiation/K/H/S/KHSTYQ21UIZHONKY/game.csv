"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be really valuable to you.  I'm asking $12,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I think that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to $11,000 to make this work.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000, so how about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
