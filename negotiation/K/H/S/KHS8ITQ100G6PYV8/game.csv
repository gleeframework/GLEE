"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is outside my budget. Given my research and the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its potential and my  limit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the true value and potential  this product offers.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably pay.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. I believe it's a fair price for both of us, given the potential of the product and my financial constraints.",850000.0,Bob,4,
