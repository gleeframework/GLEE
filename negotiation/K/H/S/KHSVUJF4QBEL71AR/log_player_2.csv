"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm looking for $120 for it. Would you like to make it yours? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Since Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, there's no benefit to accepting it.  You can get the same product from John for the same price.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to potentially negotiate a lower price with her or find a better deal elsewhere."
