"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's initial offer is the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
* There's no immediate reason to buy from John as I haven't explored Alice's willingness to negotiate. 
* I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for your product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 25% reduction. 
* This should make Alice realize that I'm serious about buying but am also price-conscious.
* By providing a specific price, I'm opening a clear negotiation point and avoiding a back-and-forth of vague offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find some middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is still too high, but at least she's showing some flexibility.
* I'm still hoping to get a lower price, so I'll reject and try to push her down further. 
* There's no reason to jump to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 is still above my budget.  How about $8,250? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm gradually increasing my offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* $8,250 is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still within my budget.
* I'm emphasizing ""fair compromise"" and ""closing the deal"" to encourage Alice to accept."
