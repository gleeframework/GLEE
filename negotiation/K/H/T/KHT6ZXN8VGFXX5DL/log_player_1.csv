Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be highly valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($150) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While $140 is our initial offer, there's a chance Bob might try to negotiate down a bit. 
* **Secure a Good Deal:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $140 is significantly better than our alternative of selling to John for $120."
