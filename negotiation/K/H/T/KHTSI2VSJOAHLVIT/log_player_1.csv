Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm afraid $130 is still pushing my budget.  I could do $110 as my final offer. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to go above his last offer of $110.  It's clear that further negotiation with him won't bridge the gap between his budget and my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price and avoids wasting further time on a negotiation that's unlikely to succeed."
