"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's worth and my financial capacity.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still significantly below its worth to you. This compromise demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
