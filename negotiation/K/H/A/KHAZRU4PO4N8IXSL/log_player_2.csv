Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is closer, it's still above my maximum price. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is limited.  Let's meet in the middle at $110.  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet at $115? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a decent profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $115 is still too high for me, and I've only got 5 rounds left. At this point, it's better to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $80. I can save money and get the product I want."
