Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 

I'm confident that I can get a better price than John's offer of $1,200,000 if Bob is truly interested in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly less than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value I place on the product. I believe this price is fair and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm not willing to accept his offer yet. I'm going to counter with a price that's more aligned with my expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price of $925,000. This is a slight reduction from my previous offer, but still reflects the value I place on the product. I believe this price is fair and demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $910,000 is very close to my desired price range. While I'd prefer to get a bit more, it's getting late in the negotiation and I'm not sure how much more we can go back and forth. I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer and having to sell to John for a lower price."
