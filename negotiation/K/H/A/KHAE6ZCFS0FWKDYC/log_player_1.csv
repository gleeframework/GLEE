Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** This anchors the negotiation closer to Bob's perceived value than your minimum. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** The offer provides space for Bob to counteroffer and feel like he's getting a ""deal"" while still ensuring you remain significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""potential worth"" and ""expertise,"" the offer subtly  appeals to Bob's business acumen, potentially making him more receptive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe the product has value, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly below his perceived value. Rejecting this offer signals that you know the product's worth and are willing to negotiate for a better price. There's still room to bargain before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both agree this product has significant value. To find a mutually beneficial point, I'm proposing $1,110,000. This reflects my understanding of its worth while acknowledging your perspective."", ""product_price"": 1110000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer meets Bob slightly closer to the middle of the previous gap, showing a willingness to compromise but not conceding too much ground.
* **Reaffirming Value:** Reiterating the ""significant value"" keeps the focus on the product's worth, subtly reminding Bob of its potential.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still well above your minimum and allows for further negotiation if Bob counters again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,080,000.  I believe that's a fair price that recognizes the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is a significant amount above your minimum ($1,000,000) and provides a substantial profit. Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or reaching an impasse. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids potentially losing out on the sale altogether."
