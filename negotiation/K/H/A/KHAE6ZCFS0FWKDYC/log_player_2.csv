"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is pretty close to your maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I believe the product has value, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:**  This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, but it's still a reasonable profit margin for her. This shows you're serious about buying but also expect a good deal. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This offer leaves room for further negotiation. Alice might counter, giving you a chance to move closer to her desired price while still staying within your budget. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** Don't forget, you can always buy from John for $1,200,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It seems we both agree this product has significant value. To find a mutually beneficial point, I'm proposing $1,110,000. This reflects my understanding of its worth while acknowledging your perspective. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to your range, but there's still room for negotiation.  She decreased her price by $40,000, so countering with a smaller increase shows you're willing to meet in the middle but still want a better deal. Let's see if we can push a bit further before considering accepting or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,080,000.  I believe that's a fair price that recognizes the product's value."",
""product_price"": 1080000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer and Alice's current price. It shows willingness to compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This price is a good balance between getting a favorable deal and potentially closing the deal quickly. 
* **Time Consideration:**  Every round of negotiation takes time. Offering a price closer to Alice's may lead to a faster agreement."
