"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay something closer to $6,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  To move this forward, I can come down to $11,500.  This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you be open to something around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $7,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to consider $9,500 to find a solution that works for both of us. This is my final offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
