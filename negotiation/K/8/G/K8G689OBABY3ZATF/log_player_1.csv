Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's room for negotiation above that price. Starting high allows for potential profit above your minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning a limited-time offer and the possibility of listing it publicly, you create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a price agreeable to both parties.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your negotiation style and how much you want to prioritize a deal with Bob over the guaranteed sale to John, you might adjust your initial offer."
