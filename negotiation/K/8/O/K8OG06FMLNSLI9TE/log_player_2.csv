Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to secure a price closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.
