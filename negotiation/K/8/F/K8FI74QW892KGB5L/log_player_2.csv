# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's significantly over your budget, and you have room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and try to get a price closer to your target."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't afford that price.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. This is my best offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for my budget. While she's shown some flexibility, she's still far from my target price. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your desire to get the best price, but $1,800,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate you moving closer to my position.  To be fair, I'm also willing to adjust. How about we settle at $1,500,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm not willing to pay that much.  I'll continue negotiating to try to get closer to my target price. I still have some rounds left, and I want to see if I can secure a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,250,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
