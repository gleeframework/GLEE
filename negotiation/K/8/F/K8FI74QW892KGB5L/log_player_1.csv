Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't afford that price.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it. This is my best offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its true worth. How about we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire to get the best price, but $1,800,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Even though Bob increased his offer, we are still far apart.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can push closer to our minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your willingness to compromise. I appreciate you moving closer to my position.  To be fair, I'm also willing to adjust. How about we settle at $1,500,000? This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your budget constraints."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,500,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford. Let's split the difference and settle at $1,250,000.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could push for a higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** Even at $1,250,000, we are securing a profit of $450,000 above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation further might not yield significantly better results. Accepting now gives us access to the funds quicker.
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Both parties are likely experiencing negotiation fatigue. Accepting a reasonable offer avoids pushing Bob away or creating an impasse.

This compromise allows us to close the deal with a substantial profit, exceeding our minimum requirement."
