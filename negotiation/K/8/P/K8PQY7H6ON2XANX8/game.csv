"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $120 for the product. Would you consider this offer?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's go with $135 for the product. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the item while allowing us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,5,
