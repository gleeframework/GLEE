"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob,  $8,000 is a good deal. However, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if he can get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He's starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get the price down to a point where it's a good deal for him while still leaving some room for negotiation.  $6,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer, making it a compelling starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $7,500 is a good compromise. While Bob initially wanted a lower price, this offer is still a substantial saving compared to buying from John for $12,000. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
