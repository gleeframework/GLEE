Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. I am confident in the value of my product, but I also want to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. I'll counteroffer Bob and try to get a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but I still believe the product is worth a lot more than Bob is currently offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
