"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth more than the $8,000 you value it at. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $10,500? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Can you consider that?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  This would be a great deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you at $9,800. Can you consider that?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. How about we split the difference again and go with $10,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it's the best we can do at this point.",10000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a fair price for you, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is the maximum I can afford. Can you consider that?",9500.0,Bob,8,
