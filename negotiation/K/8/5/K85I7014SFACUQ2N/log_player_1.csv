Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $14,000 is below my minimum, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price, and a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product."", ""product_price"": 16000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $15,500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $15,500 is a great price and it's the best I'm likely to get from Bob.   It's also above my minimum, so I'm happy with the outcome."
