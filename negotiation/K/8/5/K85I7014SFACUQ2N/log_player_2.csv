"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price, and a great opportunity for you to own this valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his maximum budget, he can still try to negotiate further or buy from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $16,000 is still above my limit. I'm willing to go up to $15,500, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 15500}
