"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but still above your maximum.** You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is asking for $1,400,000. 
* **You have room to negotiate.** You can reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price from her or potentially even get a better deal from John if you're willing to push further."
