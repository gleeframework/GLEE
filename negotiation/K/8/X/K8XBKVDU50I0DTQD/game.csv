"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product, which is what I believe it's worth. Let me know if you're interested in this price.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't sell the product for less than $130. It's high quality and worth the price. What do you say?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $115? That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
