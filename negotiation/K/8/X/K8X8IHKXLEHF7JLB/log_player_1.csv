"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for your product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives me some room to work with.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $1,200,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll keep John's offer as a backup option in case things don't work out."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,100,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,075,000? This would still give you a good deal, and it gets me closer to my target. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1075000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1060000. This is a fair compromise, and it shows my commitment to closing this deal.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,060,000 is getting closer to my target, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm confident that with a few more rounds of negotiation, I can reach an agreement that's more favorable to me. However, I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be closer to $1,100,000 to make this deal work for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,080,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1080000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1065000 for your product.  This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a deal we can both agree on. Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,065,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,065,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,065,000 is a tempting offer, I'm going to reject it and try to push for a higher price. I'm still within my 10 rounds of negotiation, and I think I can secure a deal closer to my desired $1,200,000.  I'll keep John's offer in the back of my mind as a safety net, but I'm not giving up on getting a better deal with Bob just yet."
