"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you be willing to go down to $100?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  $100 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's a good price for both of us, and I think it's fair for the quality of this product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $115? It's a good compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that.",115.0,Bob,4,
