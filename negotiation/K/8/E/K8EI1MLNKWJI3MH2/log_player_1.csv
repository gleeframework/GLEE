Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't justify spending $14,000 on it. I am willing to pay up to $10,000 for it.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly below what I can accept. Let's find a middle ground - how about $12,500? This reflects a considerable discount while still valuing the product fairly."", ""product_price"": 12500}"
