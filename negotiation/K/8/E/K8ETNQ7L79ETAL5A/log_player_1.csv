Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're making a compromise here, and I appreciate that.  To be frank, $1,000,000 is the absolute highest I can go.  It's a significant investment for me, but I believe the product is worth it at that price.  Let me know if this works for you.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to come up to $1,000,000.  However, I'm still a bit short of where I need to be. To make this deal work, I need to be at $1,150,000.  This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a significant discount on the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
