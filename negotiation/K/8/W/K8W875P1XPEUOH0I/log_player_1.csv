"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price.  $1,200,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $1,350,000? It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and still leaves you with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,275,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,275,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I can't accept $1,275,000. It's still significantly below my minimum.  To make this work, I need to be at $1,325,000. This is a small increase from your last offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still trying to get the best deal I can. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a fair compromise and gets me closer to my minimum goal.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and having to start over with John."
