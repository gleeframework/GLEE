"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a significant discount, as I'm confident in its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great:** You're getting a $1,000 discount from your maximum price, but you can potentially do better.
* **John's offer is your fallback:** If you reject Alice, you have a guaranteed alternative for $15,000. 
* **Negotiation:** By rejecting, you can potentially push Alice to lower her price further to stay competitive. 

By rejecting, you maintain leverage and could potentially get a better deal."
