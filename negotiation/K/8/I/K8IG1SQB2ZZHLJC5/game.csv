"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get this deal done.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to consider the product's value to me as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a substantial increase from my initial offer and a fair price for both of us. I believe this is a good compromise that allows us to both walk away happy with the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me at this price point.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, I still need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to offer $975,000 for the product. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us to both walk away satisfied with the deal. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",975000.0,Bob,6,
