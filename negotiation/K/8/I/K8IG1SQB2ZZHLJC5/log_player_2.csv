# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a compromise to get this deal done.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to consider the product's value to me as well.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me.

While Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is lower than her previous offers, it's still higher than Bob's target price of $800,000. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a better price.  He could counteroffer with a price closer to his target, or he could even start to consider buying from John if it seems like Alice is unwilling to budge significantly."
