Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,250,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,200,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

While we could try to push for more, accepting at $1,200,000 is a solid win.  Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:** We're still making a $200,000 profit over our minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now is better than risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer, or worse yet, having Bob walk away.  
* **Bird in Hand:** John's offer is a safety net, but Bob is offering more. It's generally better to secure a good deal now."
