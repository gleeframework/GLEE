"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $650,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $650,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $650,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. That's still a good deal for you, considering what the product is worth to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 800000}
