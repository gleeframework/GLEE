Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, and it reflects the high value I place on the product. I'm confident in my product's worth, and I'm aiming to get the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more. I'm going to try and counteroffer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,750,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping that this is a price that both of us can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,600,000 is still a good deal and much better than selling to John for $1,500,000.  It's worth securing the sale and moving forward."
