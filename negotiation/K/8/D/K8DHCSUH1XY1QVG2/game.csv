"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is a tempting offer, I'm confident this product will yield significantly more value than that for you.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I'm trying to find a balance between value and budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
