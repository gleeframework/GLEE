"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,500. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While the product is worth $10,000 to Bob, Alice is asking for $10,500.  Since Bob can get the product from John for $10,000, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John instead."
