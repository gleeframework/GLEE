"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, as you're getting the product for less than its full value to you. Let's find a middle ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $10,500 is a good price, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",9800.0,Bob,4,
