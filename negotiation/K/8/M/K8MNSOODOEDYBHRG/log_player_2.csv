Bob should reject the offer.  $1,750,000 is more than Bob's maximum budget, and there's still room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,500,000? This price still gives you a significant value, and it's a good starting point for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is within Bob's budget. While it's not the lowest possible price, it's a good deal considering the value of the product and the limited time remaining.  It's a good idea to accept this offer before the opportunity is lost."
