Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this great product for $175. It's a steal at this price, considering its value! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$175:** This is a starting price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** It's friendly and emphasizes the value of the product while leaving the door open for discussion.

This strategy aims to:

* **Get a high starting price:** This maximizes your potential earnings.
* **Maintain flexibility:** You can adjust the price based on Bob's reaction.
* **Don't reveal your minimum:** You haven't mentioned your $150 floor price yet, giving you more room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price.**  You've stated your product is worth no less than $150 to you, and Bob has offered that amount.
* **Selling to John wouldn't yield a higher profit.**  While selling to John would also net you $150, there's no benefit to that path in this scenario.
* **Accepting the offer is the most efficient choice.** It avoids further negotiation and secures your minimum desired price."
