Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $9,500. "",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing his maximum valuation is $10,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer or feel like he's getting a slightly better deal even if he accepts the initial price.
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $9,500 still yields a much higher profit than selling to John for $8,000.

This strategy aims to balance ambition with a realistic chance of securing the best possible deal with Bob."
