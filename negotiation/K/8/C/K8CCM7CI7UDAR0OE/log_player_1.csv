Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value in this product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm happy to start our negotiations with an offer of $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
