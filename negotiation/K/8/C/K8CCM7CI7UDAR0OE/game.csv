"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you reaching out. While I see the value in this product, $1,800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'm happy to start our negotiations with an offer of $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is my best offer, as I believe it reflects the product's worth while leaving room for a profitable partnership for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us.  If you can't meet me there, we might have to move on to other options.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
