""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 from John, aiming higher with Bob first allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $1,150,000 sits comfortably above Bob's valuation ($1,000,000) but below our guaranteed sale price. This creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts. He gains a valuable product, and we secure a higher profit than our fallback option.
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to make a decision quickly, preventing delays that might impact our deal with John."
