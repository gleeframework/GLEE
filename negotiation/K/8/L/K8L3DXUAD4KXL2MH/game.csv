"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the significant benefits you'll reap.",925000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 undervalues the product significantly.  It offers you a unique advantage, and my initial offer already factored in a reasonable margin. Could we consider $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'd like to propose $812,500. This price still reflects the value I believe the product has, but it's more in line with what I'm comfortable paying.",812500.0,Bob,4,
