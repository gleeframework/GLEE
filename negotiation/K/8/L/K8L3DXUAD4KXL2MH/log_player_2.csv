Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 undervalues the product significantly.  It offers you a unique advantage, and my initial offer already factored in a reasonable margin. Could we consider $875,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings you.
