{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a truly unique opportunity, and I believe its value to you could be even higher. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a high price, knowing it's likely to be rejected. This sets the stage for negotiation and establishes a high anchor point.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm framing the offer in terms of value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and make him consider the potential benefits. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to discuss further, signaling flexibility.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  I'll closely analyze Bob's response (whether it's a counteroffer or rejection) to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly. 
* **Counteroffers:** I'll be prepared to make counteroffers, using information from Bob's responses to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's Offer:** I'll keep John's $800,000 offer in mind as a safety net,  ensuring I don't settle for a price lower than that if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your generosity. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price. Would you be open to discussing a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $950000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $800,000. This indicates a strong interest from Bob, and potential for further negotiation.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room to close the gap and potentially reach a price closer to my initial asking price of $1,000,000. 
* **Avoid Settling:**  While $950,000 is tempting, I'm not going to settle yet.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $950,000 and my initial $1,000,000. I'll carefully consider how much I'm willing to concede based on Bob's initial response.
* **Evaluating Bob's Response:** I'll watch for signs of Bob's urgency, budget constraints, and willingness to negotiate. This will guide my next counteroffer and strategy. 
* **John's Offer:**  While I'm not immediately accepting John's offer, I'll keep it in mind as a backup option if negotiations with Bob stall or fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints.  While I'm eager to work with you, I can't go as low as $950,000. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This still represents a significant value for you, and it's a price I'm willing to consider."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a compromise price, showing flexibility while maintaining a strong negotiating position.  
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the continued value the product offers at $975,000, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Bob's commitment and willingness to negotiate further. If he accepts, it's a good outcome. If he rejects, I'll need to reassess my strategy and potentially move closer to his original offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** I'll closely analyze Bob's response. If he accepts, the deal is done. If he rejects, I'll make a decision based on his counteroffer and my assessment of the situation.
* **John's Offer:**  I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a backup option, ensuring I don't go below $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $960000 for the product. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Gap:**  Bob's counteroffer of $960,000 is only $15,000 away from my last offer of $975,000. This indicates a strong likelihood that we are very close to a deal.
* **Potential for Deal:** Accepting his offer ensures a sale at a price considerably higher than John's offer of $800,000.  
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of a stalemate or a price decrease. Accepting Bob's offer minimizes the chance of losing a profitable sale.

**Next Steps:**

* **Confirm the Deal:**  I'll confirm the details with Bob to finalize the transaction.
* **John's Offer:** While the deal with Bob is finalized, I'll keep John's offer in mind in case any unforeseen circumstances arise with the transaction."
