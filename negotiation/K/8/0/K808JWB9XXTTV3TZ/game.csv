"I understand you're looking to spend closer to $1,000,000, but I have to ensure I get a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that price?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,025,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1,075,000 for the product. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
