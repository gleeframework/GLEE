"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is too high. It's still above your desired price point of $1,000,000. 
* You have 10 rounds, so there's room to negotiate further and try to lower the price. 
*  It's not a good idea to buy from John immediately, as you can potentially save money by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above your target price.
* You have time to continue negotiating, so there's no immediate need to accept her offer.
* It's still too early to consider buying from John, as you can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to me is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is now within your budget of $1,000,000.
*  While it's still higher than your initial counteroffer, it's a good compromise.
* You have several rounds remaining, but there's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further. It's better to secure the product at a price that's acceptable to you than to risk losing it to John or continuing to negotiate without certainty."
