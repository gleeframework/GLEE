Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Aiming high initially leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a price closer to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the product's value subtly reminds Bob of its worth, making the high price seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is polite and invites Bob's input, signaling willingness to negotiate.

This strategy balances ambition with the flexibility to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to its worth for both of us. Would you consider $750,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $750,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and his perceived value ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would leave a substantial amount of potential profit on the table. 

While selling to John for $800,000 is an option, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal.  A counter-offer is necessary to guide the negotiation towards a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value. To be fair to both of us, I can go as low as $900,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** While acknowledging Bob's counteroffer, the message clearly states that $750,000 is too low. 
* **Strategic Concession:** Reducing the price to $900,000 shows flexibility but maintains a strong position above both your minimum and John's offer.
* **Finality:**  Stating ""this is my final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to seriously consider the deal without dragging out negotiations unnecessarily.

This strategy aims to secure a price close to your initial offer while keeping the option to sell to John if Bob remains unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose a price closer to what I am comfortable with. Could we agree on $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Profitable:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and John's offer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  It indicates Bob is willing to move closer to your desired price range. 
* **Avoiding Risk:** Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob backing out entirely, in which case you'd be left with John's lower offer.

Accepting this offer secures a strong profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether."
