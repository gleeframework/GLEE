You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Buying from Alice for $1,200,000 saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **You value the product higher than Alice:**  Since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is willing to sell for less than that, there's room for negotiation.  
* **Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice:** It allows you to get the product for a price you're happy with and still saves you money."
