Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value and I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire it!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting at your desired price ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer but ensures you don't sell for less than your guaranteed amount. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and positions the offer as an ""opportunity"" for Bob. 

**Important Note:** While you could try for a price higher than $10,000, it's less likely Bob will accept knowing the product is only worth $8,000 to him. This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal while minimizing the risk of losing the sale to Bob."
