"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product offers is truly significant, and $950,000 undervalues its potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but I think that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price?",980000.0,Bob,4,
