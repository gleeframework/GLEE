Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which both you and Bob would agree exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.  

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other interested parties. Considering its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and opportunity can encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **High but Negotiable:** $1,450,000 gives you room to negotiate down while still staying above your minimum.
* **Value-Focused:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition,"" subtly reminding Bob why he's interested.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go. Remember, your fallback option of John guarantees you a strong position."
