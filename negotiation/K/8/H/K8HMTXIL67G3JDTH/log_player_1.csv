Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a new offer of $9,500. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's clear he's unlikely to reach $10,000. It's more profitable for me to sell to John at my desired price than to potentially continue haggling with Bob."
