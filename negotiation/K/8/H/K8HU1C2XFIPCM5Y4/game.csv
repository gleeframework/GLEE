"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $680000, but no lower. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider purchasing the product from John for $1500000. I'm confident that's a better deal for me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement.",680000.0,Bob,10,
