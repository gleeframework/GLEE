"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above what I'm willing to pay.  I'm only interested in paying $8,000 for this product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me.  While $8,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm still a bit higher than where I want to be.  How about we meet at $11,000? I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
