Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal is beneficial for both parties.  The ZOPA exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Opening:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message highlights the product's value and positions the price as justified.
* **Sense of Urgency (Implied):** By mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you subtly imply that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Negotiation Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly lower within the ZOPA. 
* **Relationship Value:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, you might adjust your approach accordingly.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially adjust your price based on Bob's response."
