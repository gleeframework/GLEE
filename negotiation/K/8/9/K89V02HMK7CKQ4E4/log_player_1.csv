{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. This is a great deal for a product worth at least $12,000 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $11,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's worth to me, making it seem like a good deal for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I invite Bob to respond, showing I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $12,000, so I can walk away if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9500. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I still have room to negotiate with Bob. While I don't want to risk losing him entirely, I can likely get a better price than his initial offer.
* **John as a Backup:** Having John as a backup option gives me the flexibility to walk away if the negotiation stalls or if Bob's counteroffers remain too low. 

**Next Steps:** I will counter with a price closer to my desired value, leaving some room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a great deal on a valuable product. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I reiterate the product's worth to emphasize the deal I'm offering.
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I phrase it as ""finding common ground"", leaving the door open for further negotiation.
* **John is Still an Option:** I haven't forgotten about John, so if Bob doesn't come up, I can always go with the guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9800? I think that's a fair price for a great product like this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  $9,800 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not ready to settle for a price that undervalues my product.
* **Negotiation Continues:** There's still a gap between our positions, and I believe there's room for further negotiation to get a better price.
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.

**Next Steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a slightly lower price, hopefully finding a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,200, which is a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Smaller Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility, but still maintaining a price that is closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I emphasize ""fair price"" and ""value"" to reiterate the product's worth and justify my stance.
* **Seeking a Solution:**  I focus on finding a solution that works for both of us, demonstrating my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is Still an Option:** If Bob rejects this offer, I still have the option of selling to John for $12,000.

**Strategy:** By making a smaller concession and highlighting the value of the product, I hope to entice Bob to accept this counteroffer and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
