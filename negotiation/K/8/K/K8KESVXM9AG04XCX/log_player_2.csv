"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in paying $12000 for it?  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than the $15,000 she values it at, Bob can get the product for $10,000 from John. It's always better to get a lower price, even if it means a slightly longer search."
