Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $102. I'll offer it to you for $108. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you!

```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference between her offer and your ideal price is getting smaller. It's better to accept the deal at $108 rather than risk the negotiations failing and having to buy from John for $150."
