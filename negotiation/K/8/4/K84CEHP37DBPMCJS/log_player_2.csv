Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $810,000, which is a compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer. What do you think?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $810,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer you a price of $795,000, which is a slight increase from your last offer. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $795,000 is very close to your maximum budget of $800,000.  While you could continue negotiating, it's likely that Alice won't budge much further, and you risk losing the deal.  At this point, it's better to accept the offer and secure the product, rather than potentially getting nothing."
