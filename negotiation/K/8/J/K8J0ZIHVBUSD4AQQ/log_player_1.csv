Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $115."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100 from the sale. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** By offering the product at $115, you're aiming for a price that's:
    *  Lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay, making it likely he'll accept.
    *  Significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, maximizing your potential profit.

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit than selling to John."
