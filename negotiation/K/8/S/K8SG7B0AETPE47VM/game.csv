"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go above $700,000. Can you consider my offer?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see something closer to my original offer. How about $850,000? This still represents a great value for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
