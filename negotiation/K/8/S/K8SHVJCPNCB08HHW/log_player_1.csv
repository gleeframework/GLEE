Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1150000. I believe that's a more reasonable price given the product's value to me.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still need to make a reasonable profit. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $1,150,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Let's split the difference.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1100000. That's my final offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm getting closer to my minimum, $1,100,000 still isn't enough. I'll see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but this product is truly exceptional and I'm not sure we can reach a mutually agreeable price at this point. I'm going to have to decline your offer, but I'm willing to offer one final counteroffer at $1,175,000. I'm not willing to go lower than this.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product to you."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $1100000. I've already gone as high as I can. I'm willing to meet you at $1100000, but no more. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm selling the product to John for $1,200,000.  Bob seems determined to stay below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price or failing to close a deal at all."
