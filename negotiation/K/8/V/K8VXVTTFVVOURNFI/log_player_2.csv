# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you're willing to pay up to $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $8500 is tempting, I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. How about $9250? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still respecting your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250.

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows me to try for a lower price."
