"Alice, thanks for the offer. $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you consider $8500? I'm very interested in your product, but I need to stay within my budget.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $8500 is tempting, I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. How about $9250? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still respecting your budget.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9250 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us. How about $9000?  I'm very serious about buying this product, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
