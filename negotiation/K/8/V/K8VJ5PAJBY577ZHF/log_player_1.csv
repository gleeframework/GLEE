Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $18,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price, but I'm open to discussing if you have a different perspective."", ""product_price"": 18000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down while still achieving a potentially profitable outcome.
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** The $18,000 offer is a starting point to see how interested Bob is and to get him to counter. His response will give me valuable information about his perceived value of the product. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at $12,000, so I won't go below that price in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $18,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is far below both my minimum ($12,000) and his stated value of the product.  Accepting this offer would be a significant loss. It's clear we're far apart in our valuations.  I will counter, but I'm also keeping John in mind as a viable alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $8,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $15,000.  This reflects a more realistic market value."", ""product_price"": 15000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility, but Holding Ground:** I want to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate by dropping from $18,000, but the $15,000 price point keeps me in a profitable range.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""market value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob that this is a desirable item with potential demand beyond just his offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counter-offer puts me in a stronger position. If Bob accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects and goes much lower, I can comfortably walk away and sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $8,000 is low, but $15,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I could try to negotiate for a bit more, it's unlikely Bob will be willing to go much higher, especially since he's already increased his initial offer.  

Accepting $11,000 ensures a profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away from the deal entirely."
