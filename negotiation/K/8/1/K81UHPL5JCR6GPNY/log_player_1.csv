Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value, especially considering its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** You know Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Maximizing profit:**  Offering it at $14,000 gives Bob a $1,000 incentive to buy from you instead of exploring other options. This price also earns you a $2,000 profit above your minimum.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the offer is firm, the friendly tone leaves a slight opening for Bob to counter-offer if he's very price-sensitive."
