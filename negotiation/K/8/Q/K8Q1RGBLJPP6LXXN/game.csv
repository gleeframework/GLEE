"Alice, I appreciate your offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for this exceptional item.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while staying within my budget. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
