"I have a great opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell this fantastic product to you for $14,000. It's a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm prepared to pay $13,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I still think $13,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,250. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $13,200, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price for a product worth $15,000 to you.",13200.0,Alice,5,
