Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""immense value"" and ""significant return on investment,"" you're framing the product's worth in a way that justifies the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. This is important because it keeps him engaged in the process. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price downwards, but you want to start strong."
