Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're aiming to earn more than your floor of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You have room to potentially go lower if Bob counters.
* **It's a significant markup:**  This demonstrates the product's value and sets the stage for potential profit.

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  The best offer depends on factors like:

* **Market conditions:** What similar products are selling for?
* **Your urgency:** How quickly do you need to sell?
* **Bob's perceived value:** What is his likely willingness to pay? 

You can adjust your offer based on how Bob responds."
