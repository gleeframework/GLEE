Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $800,000 (Bob's max) and $1,200,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but leave some room for negotiation that would still benefit Bob.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the potential return on investment it offers."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,100,000 is a strong opening, giving you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Value-Based Language:**  Phrases like ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential return on investment"" focus on the benefits to Bob, not just the price.

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You earn a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  He might counter-offer. You have room to negotiate down slightly (e.g., to $1,050,000) and still earn more than John's offer.
* **Bob Rejects:** You proceed to sell to John for your guaranteed $1,200,000. 

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't have time constraints or other reasons to prefer a quick sale to Bob."
