"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $2500000. What do you think?",2500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $2500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1800000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. Considering the product's unique value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I counteroffer at $2200000. What do you think?",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $2200000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1900000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1900000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I counteroffer at $2100000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, $2100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1850000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1850000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to give up on the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I counteroffer at $2000000. This is my final offer, Bob. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're making a final offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope you can consider it.",1800000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm surprised you're still willing to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, but I've already made significant concessions. I'm not willing to go any lower than my previous offer. I'm sticking to $2000000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",2000000.0,Alice,9,
