"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $150 is your maximum budget, it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price. There's no downside to rejecting the first offer and exploring further options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $120, aiming to get a good discount. This demonstrates my serious interest while also leaving room for potential negotiation. I'm aiming to split the difference between my budget and Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price. Accepting her offer at $140 allows me to get a decent discount and still stay within my budget.  Further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John, or Alice becoming more firm, is too high."
