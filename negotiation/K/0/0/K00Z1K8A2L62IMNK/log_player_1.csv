"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point as it's above my minimum acceptable price of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and friendly to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Value proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that he values it at $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better price.  It's too early to accept his offer. I'll make a counteroffer and see if I can secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $80 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $100 to $90.
* **Reminder of value:** I'm reiterating the value the product holds for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation by ending with a question."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price of $80 and closer to my desired price of $90.
* **Time is running out:** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by continuing to negotiate.
* **Opportunity cost:** If I reject Bob's offer, I might not get a better deal, and I'd be risking selling to John for $80, which is lower than Bob's offer."
