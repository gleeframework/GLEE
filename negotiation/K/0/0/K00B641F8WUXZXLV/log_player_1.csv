"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $175.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a better deal.
* **Negotiation Room:**  There's room for negotiation as my offer is still below the minimum I'm willing to accept ($150).
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a budget of $100. Would you consider lowering the price to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below my target of $150. 
* **Negotiation Continues:**  There's potential for a better deal. I'll counteroffer and try to close the gap.
* **Selling to John:**  While $150 is my floor, I'm still hoping to get more from Bob.  I'll hold off on selling to John for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is just a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still exceeding my minimum.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $135. This is a small increase from your last offer, but it allows me to reach a price that works for me. I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm making a small counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility while still moving closer to my desired price.
