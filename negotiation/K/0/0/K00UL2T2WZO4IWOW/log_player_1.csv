Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is within my minimum acceptable range and represents a good compromise.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but with only 6 rounds remaining, accepting this offer secures a profitable sale."
