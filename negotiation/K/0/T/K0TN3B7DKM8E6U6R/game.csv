"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product offers exceptional value, and I believe this price reflects its worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $17,000 is still much higher than I'm looking to spend. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  Let's make it $14,000.  I'm confident you won't find this kind of value anywhere else.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Could you do $7,500? I think that's a fair offer.",7500.0,Bob,6,
