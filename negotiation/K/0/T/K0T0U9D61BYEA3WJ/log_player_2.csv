"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $12,000. The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's likely Alice would be willing to negotiate further, knowing she can get $8,000 for the product from you or $15,000 from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above your desired price range.  You can likely get a lower price with another counteroffer. The key is to keep negotiating and slowly move towards a price that's both acceptable to you and profitable for Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still trying to secure a good price. It's likely Alice will accept this offer as it's closer to her desired price than what she could get from John."
