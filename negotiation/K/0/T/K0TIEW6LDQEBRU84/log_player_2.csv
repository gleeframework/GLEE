Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $18000. This still leaves room for us to find a mutually agreeable price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $18,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $15,000.  This is my final offer, and it's the maximum I can spend."", ""product_price"": 15000}
