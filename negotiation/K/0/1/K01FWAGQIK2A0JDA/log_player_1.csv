I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum price of $100, giving me room to negotiate if needed. I'm curious to see what Bob's reaction will be!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go that low. I'll reject his offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm counteroffering with $120.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob while still leaving me with a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to earn more, I'm happy to accept this offer and avoid further negotiations. It's a good deal for both of us!"
