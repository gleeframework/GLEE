Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,250 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000. It's not worth risking another round of negotiation as I could potentially end up paying more than I'm comfortable with. It's better to stick to my original plan and buy the product from John for $10,000."
