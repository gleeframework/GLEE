"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you working with me. However, $12000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11500. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11500 is still slightly above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $11000? I'm confident this would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to close the deal. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $11250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
