"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a special price of $1,200,000. It's a significant value for you, considering the worth it holds for you. I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to Bob, it's still higher than the price John is offering.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to secure the product for $1,000,000 from John, resulting in a larger savings."
