Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate upwards.  I'm also aware that I have a backup buyer in John, giving me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable, I believe I can get a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can negotiate higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $17,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still leaves some room for profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer, and while it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal. I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product to him."
