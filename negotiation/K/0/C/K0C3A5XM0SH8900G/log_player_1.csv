"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer, but I'm always willing to walk away and sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is still a good price, I want to see if I can get closer to my ideal price.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $12,500.  This is a fair price considering both our valuations, and I'm hoping he'll accept it.  If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John for $12,000 since we are already at the halfway point of our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'll counter again to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12200}
```

I'm offering $12,200, which is just a little higher than Bob's last offer.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're getting close to a deal, but it's taking too long.  I've already had several rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure if we'll be able to reach a price that satisfies both of us.  To avoid risking a further decrease in price, I'm going to sell to John for $12,000. It's a guaranteed deal and it's the best option for me at this point."
