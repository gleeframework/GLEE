Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" aims to subtly anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth above his initial valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone suggests willingness to discuss the price, encouraging Bob to counter-offer rather than simply reject the initial proposal.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000, so there's no risk of selling below your minimum.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while maintaining a professional and persuasive approach with Bob."
