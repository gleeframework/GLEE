"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still looking for something closer to my original price.  How about $9,500? That's a significant discount, and it's still a fair price for the value you'll get.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,4,
