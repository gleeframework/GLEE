"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm on a tight budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that budget constraints can be a challenge. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This price still reflects the product's exceptional value, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, so I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this exceptional product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid $1050000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make a final offer of $925000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
