"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $140. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $160 is still a little higher than my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $150? It's a fair price for both of us.",150.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a good price for you, but I'm not sure I want to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but not much. How about $165?",165.0,Alice,5,
