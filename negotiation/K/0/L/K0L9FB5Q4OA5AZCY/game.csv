"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $1,300,000 is simply out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is the maximum I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product holds substantial value, and I'm confident it can bring you significant benefits.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to let it go for $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my seriousness in acquiring this product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
