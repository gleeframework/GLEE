{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still getting more than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **It leaves room for a counteroffer:** This allows for a natural progression of the negotiation. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I want for the product, and it's also lower than the value he perceives it to have. While I need to be careful not to push him away, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject his counteroffer and send a new one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $850,000? This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value you place on this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm offering $850,000, which is:

* **Above Bob's offer:** This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a huge loss for myself.
* **Below my initial offer:** This keeps the negotiation moving forward and shows flexibility.
* **Still above my minimum:** This ensures I'm not accepting a price that's below my acceptable limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, and I appreciate the discount you're offering. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is a good compromise.  It's close enough to my desired price that it's worth closing the deal, especially considering that selling to John would only net me $175,000 more.  It's also likely that further negotiation would lead to a lower price, so I'm content with this outcome."
