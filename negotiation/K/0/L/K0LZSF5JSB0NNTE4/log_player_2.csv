Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $850,000? This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value you place on this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.
