"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $850,000? This is a significant discount from my initial price, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value you place on this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, and I appreciate the discount you're offering. However, $850,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is the highest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
