Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is below Bob's value but above my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive message:** I'm emphasizing the product's value and how it's a good fit for Bob. This can encourage him to make a deal.
* **Flexibility:**  If Bob rejects, I can always go down to $13,000 or even $12,000 if needed, but starting high gives me the best chance of getting a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $12,500 is better than selling to John for $12,000, it's still below my minimum desired price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I can counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Negotiation:** It's likely Bob will be willing to negotiate slightly higher, especially since he's expressed interest in the product.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the negotiation open and have the opportunity to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher than $12,500.  How about $13,500?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's higher than his offer but lower than my original offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the good deal he's getting at this price, reminding him that the product is worth $15,000 to him.
* **Open communication:** I'm asking for his thoughts, showing that I'm open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a fair price. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is my absolute minimum. I'm not willing to go lower.
* **No further negotiation:**  While I might be able to get a slightly higher price with more negotiation, it's unlikely that Bob will budge further.  
* **Time is money:**  Continued negotiation could drag on, and I risk losing time and potentially losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  

Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get my minimum price, and I can move on to other opportunities."
