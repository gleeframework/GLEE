"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price than Alice's offer ($900,000) since it's worth $800,000 to her. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Buying from John is a last resort, as it's the most expensive option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point for negotiation. It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. By offering a price closer to Alice's value, there's a higher chance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is still higher than the product's value to her. While it's closer to my desired price, I can still try to negotiate further.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as there's still potential for a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise. It's still below her desired price, but closer to her value. This approach could encourage Alice to accept and avoid further negotiation rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is very close to my maximum budget.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a high chance we won't reach an agreement that's satisfactory for both of us.  At this point, buying from John is the most practical option. It guarantees I get the product, even if it's at a higher price than I initially hoped for."
