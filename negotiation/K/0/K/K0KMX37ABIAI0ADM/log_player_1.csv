Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $16,000. I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's a fair offer:**  It's above your minimum price but not too far from Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It opens the door for dialogue:** The message encourages Bob to respond and potentially start a negotiation. 

It's important to be flexible and ready to adjust your offer based on Bob's responses, always keeping in mind your goal of maximizing your earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a decent amount, it's significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.  I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $12,000, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to go down to $14,000. This is a good product and we're both looking for a fair deal, right?  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I'm working with a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffer of $13,000 is still above my minimum price of $15,000.  It's a reasonable compromise and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by pushing for more."
