"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $900,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a good price, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
