,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can we meet in the middle at $14000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we split the difference and go with $16000?  This would give us both a good deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $14500. Can we meet at that price?",14500.0,Bob,4,
