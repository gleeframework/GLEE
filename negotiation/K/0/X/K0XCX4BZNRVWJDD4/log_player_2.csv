(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're looking to pay no more than $120. 
* Alice's offer of $115 is too high.
* It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

*  You want to pay as little as possible, and your maximum is $120.
* A counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable starting point, giving Alice some room to negotiate while still leaving you room to pay less than your maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

*  You're still looking to pay less than $110. 
* Alice's offer is closer to your target, but there's still room for negotiation. 
* You want to try to get the price down further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved from $115 to $110, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* You're willing to pay up to $120, so a counteroffer of $108 leaves room for compromise and is a reasonable step towards meeting in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down significantly, and her current offer of $109 is just $1 below your maximum acceptable price of $120.
* While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might not budge or you might lose too much time in further rounds. 
* It's best to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that's still within your budget."
