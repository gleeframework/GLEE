"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,100,000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to find a deal that works for both of us, $950,000 is a significant gap from where I see the product's value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
