"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given my assessment of the product, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,000,000 is certainly a significant sum, the true value of this product is considerably higher, especially given the benefits you've acknowledged. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its worth.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value you see in this product, but $1,200,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer. I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still giving us both a positive outcome. Let's make this happen.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
