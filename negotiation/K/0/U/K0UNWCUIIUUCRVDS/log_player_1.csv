I'm starting with a price of $14,000.  This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate and hopefully leads to a successful deal.  If he rejects this, I'll consider his counteroffer and my options before making a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm offering $13,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this price is fair, given that Bob clearly sees value in the product and is willing to pay more than his initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm worried that further negotiation might result in a lower price.  It's time to secure a deal that meets my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John ensures I get my desired amount."
