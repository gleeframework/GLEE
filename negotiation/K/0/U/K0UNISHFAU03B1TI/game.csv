"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking $11,250 is a fair price for this product. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,250 is still a little steep for me.  I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,750? That's a fair price for me, and hopefully, it allows you to still make a profit.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much. How about $11,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",11000.0,Alice,5,
