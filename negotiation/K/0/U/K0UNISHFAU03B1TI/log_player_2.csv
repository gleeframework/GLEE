"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating.  He has 10 rounds, so there's time to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's still above Alice's minimum, but significantly lower than her initial offer. This shows he's serious about buying but is also willing to negotiate.  The $500 difference leaves room for further bargaining without risking a complete breakdown."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking $11,250 is a fair price for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still a bit higher than Bob's desired price point, but it does demonstrate her willingness to negotiate. Bob has a few more rounds to try and bring the price down further. By rejecting, he can explore if Alice is willing to go lower than $11,250."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,250 is still a little steep for me.  I'm really hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,750? That's a fair price for me, and hopefully, it allows you to still make a profit."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of making small incremental counteroffers.  He's shown willingness to negotiate and is offering a price that's closer to his desired range.  The offer is still above Alice's minimum, indicating Bob is serious about buying. He's also using positive language to keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving away too much. How about $11,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering the same price as her initial offer but is adding ""extras"" to sweeten the deal. This is a good sign that she is motivated to close the deal. While Bob ideally wants to pay less, the ""extras"" could be valuable and the price is close to his maximum.  Accepting here ensures he gets the product and avoids potentially paying the full $12,000 to John."
