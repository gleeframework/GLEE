"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,200,000).** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a better alternative with John at $1,500,000.** This sets a clear upper limit on what you're willing to pay. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price.**

By rejecting the offer, you can try to lower the price and save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My counteroffer is lower than Alice's initial offer but higher than the product's worth to her.** This suggests a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.
* **It leaves a margin for Alice to consider.** A lower price than her initial offer, but not drastically low, potentially making it more attractive to her than rejecting and counteroffering again.
* **It remains within my budget and provides a decent saving compared to John's price.**

By starting at a lower price, I aim to see if Alice will accept and save the most money possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now higher than my initial budget limit ($1,500,000).**  There's no point in continuing the negotiation.
* **Buying from John is still a better option than accepting Alice's offer.** It provides me with the product at the same price as my initial budget constraint.
* **There's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further.** She may counter with even higher prices.

By buying from John, I secure the product within my budget and avoid the risk of further negotiations leading to a higher price."
