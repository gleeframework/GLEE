"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great investment for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still quite high.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that should be more comfortable for both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still significantly higher than my preferred price point and leaves less room for negotiation. It's worth rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my target of $900,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're willing to go up to $950,000, Bob. However, I'm still not sure if that's enough for me to feel comfortable with the sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my target.  It's also significantly lower than the $1,500,000 I would pay John.  At this point, it's worth accepting the offer and closing the deal.  Further negotiation could be time-consuming and may not result in a lower price."
