"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,350,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,000,000
* **Your Maximum:** $1,000,000

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what John is offering.  While Alice might be open to negotiation, there's no guarantee she'll go as low as John's price. You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and securing the product from John at your target price."
