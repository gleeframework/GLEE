"I understand that $18000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to consider my own costs and value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, but I'm still interested in selling to you. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'll counteroffer at $15500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15000 and the value to you is $10000. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
