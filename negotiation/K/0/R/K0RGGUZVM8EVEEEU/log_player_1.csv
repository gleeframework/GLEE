Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Bob's offer:

While I could continue negotiating with Bob, it's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price of $100. It makes more sense to take the sure profit than risk a lower outcome with Bob."
