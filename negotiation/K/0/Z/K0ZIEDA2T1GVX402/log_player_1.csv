Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation.  I'll be flexible, but I'm not willing to go below my minimum value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum value, but it's closer than his initial rejection. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I've already lowered my price twice. While I'm not getting my ideal price, selling to John for $150 ensures I meet my minimum goal. Further negotiation with Bob risks wasting time and potentially getting a lower price."
