Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $11,500 is a strong starting point, it allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Higher than John's Offer:** This price ensures that even if Bob negotiates a bit, you'll still earn more than selling to John. 

This offer strikes a balance between being attractive to Bob while still maximizing potential profit for Alice."
