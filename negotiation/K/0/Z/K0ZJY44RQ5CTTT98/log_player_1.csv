"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","I'll start by making an offer that is slightly above my minimum value of $100, but not too high. Let's say I'll offer Bob the product for:

This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate from here."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better price for the product."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's last offer was $105, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. Let's say I'll offer Bob the product for:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
