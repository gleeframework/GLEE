"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. I believe it's a great value for you, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is your maximum budget, there's no reason to rush into buying at the initial offer.  Rejecting allows you to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  It's also a chance to learn more about the product's value and determine if it's actually worth that much to you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  $15,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  Would you be willing to consider $12,000?  I'm genuinely interested in this product, but I need to stay within a specific budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, but her offer is still above my target. It's better to continue exploring if we can get closer to my desired price point.  Rejecting allows for another round of counteroffers and potentially a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $13,500 is still a bit high, but I'm getting closer to my budget.  Would you consider $13,000?  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
