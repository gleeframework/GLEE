"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get a better deal than $13,000.  Reject the offer and see if Alice will come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is already a significant discount.  I could meet you halfway at $11,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $11,500 is more than you hoped for, it's still a good deal compared to John's price and you've already rejected Alice's previous offer.  Accepting at this point is a good move."
