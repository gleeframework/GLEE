Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I aim for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) without exceeding it.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $14,000 still yields a profit of $4,000, which is significantly better than John's offer of $10,000. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes no further information about Bob's negotiation tactics or risk tolerance.  A different approach might be necessary with additional insights into Bob's behavior."
