"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95.  I think it's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $85 just isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $90?  That's still a great deal for you, as you'd be getting it for $10 less than it's worth to you.  What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. Can you meet me halfway and accept this price?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you.  $87.50 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet at $89? That's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",89.0,Alice,5,

"I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about we meet at $88? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",88.0,Bob,6,
