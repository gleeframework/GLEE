"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000 for it, based on its value to me. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $1,150,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value and your needs.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a little higher than my ideal price point. I'm willing to offer $1,225,000, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1225000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I've got to consider my own needs and the product's value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
