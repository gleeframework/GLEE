"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to get a little frustrated here.  We've been going back and forth, and I'm still not seeing a price that works for me.  If you're serious about this deal, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,150,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept, I'm going to have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
