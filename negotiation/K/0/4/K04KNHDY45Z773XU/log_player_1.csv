{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. By expressing openness to discussion, I aim to engage Bob and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $12,000 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $13,500? I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is only $500 below my last offer. I've already lowered my price significantly, and it's getting closer to my minimum value. Accepting his offer ensures a sale, and I'm confident I can get a better price by selling to John in the future if I need to."
