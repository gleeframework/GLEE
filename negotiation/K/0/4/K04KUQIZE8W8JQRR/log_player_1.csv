{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to counter his offer or walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything less than $14,000.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob, or at least convince him to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $12,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we split the difference and I sell it to you for $13,250? That way we both get a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's getting closer.  It's also a bit higher than my last counteroffer of $13,250. Considering the risk of him walking away, and the fact that John is willing to pay $15,000, accepting this offer is the best choice right now."
