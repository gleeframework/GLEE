"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below the value this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This feels like a fair price considering its benefits.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $19,000 is still too high for my budget.  I could consider going up to $9,500.  Do you think we could make something work around there?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's meet in the middle. How about $17,000? This reflects my bottom line while acknowledging your interest.",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down, but that's still a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $10,000, but that's really the most I can do.  It's a fair offer considering my budget.",10000.0,Bob,6,
