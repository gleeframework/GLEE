"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,000 is just too low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500? This still leaves you a good margin for profit, and it's fair for me as well.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,000? I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
