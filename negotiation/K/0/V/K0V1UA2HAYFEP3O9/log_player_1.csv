Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price closer to Bob's maximum perceived value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that the price is justified.
* **Time Pressure:**  Telling Bob you have other options (listing publicly) creates a sense of urgency and might encourage him to act quickly.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message implies willingness to negotiate,  giving Bob a chance to counter-offer.

Even if Bob rejects the initial offer of $20,000, there's a chance he'll counter with a price above your minimum of $15,000. You have nothing to lose by starting high, as you have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price."
