"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. It's important to remember that my minimum value is $12,000, so I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't come close to that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. It's well below my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm going to counter Bob with a price of $13,000.  This is still above my minimum value but closer to Bob's offer. This allows for some room for negotiation while still keeping my potential profit high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not comfortable selling the product for that price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $11,000.  This is closer to Bob's latest offer, but still above my minimum value. We're getting closer to an agreement, but I'm still not ready to sell at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to reject this offer and see if he's willing to go higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,500. This is a small increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal."
