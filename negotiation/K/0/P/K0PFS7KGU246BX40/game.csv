"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is a bit high for me. I'm thinking closer to  $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Bob.  However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,000,000 doesn't quite reflect that.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,900,000. This takes into account your feedback while acknowledging the product's worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  That said, $1,900,000 is still a bit steep for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant investment for you, but I truly believe the product's value will prove itself in the long run.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
