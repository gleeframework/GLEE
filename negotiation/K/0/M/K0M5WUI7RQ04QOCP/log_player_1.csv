Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $11,500 is a much better outcome than accepting John's offer of $10,000."
