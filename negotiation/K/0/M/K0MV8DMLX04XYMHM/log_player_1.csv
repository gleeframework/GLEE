Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a reasonable starting point as it's above my minimum price and leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to get close to the $10,000 value Bob places on the product, but I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}

I'm counteroffering with $10,500.  This is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also trying to secure a price closer to my desired value."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure of potentially losing the deal, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll counteroffer again."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product for $10,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm hoping Bob will accept. We're nearing the halfway point in negotiations, and I want to ensure I don't miss out on a good deal with John."
