"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $95 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
You can get the product for a better price than $95 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price. $85 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.

While $90 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it is still more than what you are willing to pay.  You can still try to negotiate a lower price or purchase from John for $100."
