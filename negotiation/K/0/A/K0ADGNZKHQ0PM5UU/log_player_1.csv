Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is quite limited. I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While your proposed price is below my initial expectations, I recognize the value this product holds for you. I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,275,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000. I hope this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and has now offered $1,200,000 twice.  While it's tempting to accept, there's still room for negotiation. We're aiming higher, and with several rounds left, a firm but flexible approach makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the value of this product goes beyond the current offer. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a final price of $1,230,000. This reflects my best offer, and I believe it's a compelling deal for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1230000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to a point where holding out for a significantly higher price might backfire.  This offer sends a signal that we're serious about closing the deal but still leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit further. The ""final offer"" language adds weight."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts in adjusting the price. However, based on my financial situation, I am unable to meet a price higher than $1,200,000. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now offered $1,200,000 three times and explicitly stated he can't go higher. While a higher price might be ideal, the risk of losing the deal and ending up with John's $800,000 offer is too significant. Accepting secures a healthy profit and avoids potentially costly further negotiation."
