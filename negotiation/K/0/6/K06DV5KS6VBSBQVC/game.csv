"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1200000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This still allows for a significant profit margin for you while reflecting the true value of the product. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
