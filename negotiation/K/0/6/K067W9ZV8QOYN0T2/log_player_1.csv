"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $95. Could you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While I could push for a bit more, accepting $95 from Bob is a good compromise. It's more than his initial offer and still a decent profit over John's guaranteed $100."
