"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $8,000 to you. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given that the product is only worth $8,000 to me, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $9,000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. Given the product's true value, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my valuation. I would like to counter with a price of $9,200. This is still above the $8,000 threshold I set, but it's as close as I can go while staying within my budget constraints.",9200.0,Bob,4,
