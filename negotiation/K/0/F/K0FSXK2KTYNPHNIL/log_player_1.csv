You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is offering my absolute minimum acceptable price. There is no room for negotiation to get a better price from him. I'll take the guaranteed $120 from John."
