Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $135. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm going for a price that's slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also being friendly and encouraging to make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find the product at a lower price. Would you consider selling it for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $120 is just too low for me. How about $125?  That's still a great price for such a great product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we both can agree on."
