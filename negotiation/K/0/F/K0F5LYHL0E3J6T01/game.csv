"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $16,000 for the product. It's still a good deal for you, considering you value it at $15,000.  What do you say?",16000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $16,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $17,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $16,500? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm sure we can finalize this quickly.",16500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $16,500 is still a bit higher than your target price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",16750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $16,750 is still a little higher than I'd like to go. Let's split the difference and go with $16,625. That way we both get a fair deal, and I can finally get this product.",16625.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that $16,625 is still a bit higher than your target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,7,
