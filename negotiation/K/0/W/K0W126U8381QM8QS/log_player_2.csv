"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than her true value, it's still higher than Bob's maximum. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $1,050,000, which is still more than Bob wants to pay. 
* However, this is only $50,000 more than buying from John. 
* Since there are only 7 rounds left, it's a good strategy to accept this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation. 
* The potential savings of $50,000 aren't worth the potential risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice, especially with John's offer as a safety net."
