"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for my budget right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
