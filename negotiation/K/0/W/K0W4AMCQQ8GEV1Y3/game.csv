"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but $800,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $850,000. Would that be agreeable to you?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to get closer to $850,000, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, this is getting close. I can appreciate the compromises we've both made to reach this point.  How about $880,000 and we have a deal?",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. $880,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $900,000? I think we can meet in the middle at this price.",900000.0,Alice,7,
