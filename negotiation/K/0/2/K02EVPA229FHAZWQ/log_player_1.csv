"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be very valuable to you.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value, but not too far off to be immediately rejected. This allows for negotiation space. 
* **Friendly tone:** A positive message sets the stage for a potentially mutually beneficial exchange.
* **Leaving the door open:** I don't want to sound too aggressive. This initial offer is a starting point for discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I have 9 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and there's a strong chance I can get closer to my target. Selling to John now would be the most lucrative option, but I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a bit more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is tempting, I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Moving closer:** I'm coming down from my initial offer but still remaining above Bob's offer.  
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and hopeful tone keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Suggesting compromise:**  I'm implicitly proposing a middle ground, hoping to encourage Bob to come up slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is getting closer to my target, it's still quite a bit below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'm confident I can get closer to that with more negotiation.  There are still 6 rounds left, and the risk of selling to John for $15,000 is always there.  I'm going to see if I can get Bob to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I respect that.  However, $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows me to cover my costs while ensuring you get a valuable product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's perspective:** I'm showing empathy for Bob's situation to maintain a positive negotiating environment.
* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a higher price than his last offer.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to motivate him to raise his offer.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit above my target price.  I'm willing to offer $9,750 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to both close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,750 is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I have 4 more rounds to negotiate with Bob. I'm going to see if I can get him to go higher by offering a counter-offer. I want to make sure I get as much as possible for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I see we're getting closer.  $9,750 is still a bit low for me, though.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Positive reinforcement:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's effort and progress, keeping the tone positive.
* **Splitting the difference:** I'm offering a compromise by proposing the midpoint between our last offers.
* **Closing the deal:**  I'm emphasizing the desire to reach an agreement and move forward. 
* **Fairness appeal:**  I'm reiterating the fairness of my offer for both parties."
