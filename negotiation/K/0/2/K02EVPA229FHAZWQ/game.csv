"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think will be very valuable to you.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is tempting, I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value we both see in this product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I respect that.  However, $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows me to cover my costs while ensuring you get a valuable product.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit above my target price.  I'm willing to offer $9,750 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to both close this deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I see we're getting closer.  $9,750 is still a bit low for me, though.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,7,
