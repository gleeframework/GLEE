Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $9,000 is tempting, I need to make sure I get a price that reflects the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to offer $9,500 for the product. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value we both see in this product."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I respect that.  However, $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows me to cover my costs while ensuring you get a valuable product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $10,000 is getting closer to his price point, he should keep pushing for a lower price.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000, but I'm still a bit above my target price.  I'm willing to offer $9,750 for the product.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us to both close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I see we're getting closer.  $9,750 is still a bit low for me, though.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000.  He has already gone through six rounds of negotiation, and Alice is only willing to come down to $10,000.  This is still higher than Bob's target price of $8,000.  Since Bob has the option to buy the product from John for $8,000, it's a better option to avoid further negotiation and just buy the product from John."
