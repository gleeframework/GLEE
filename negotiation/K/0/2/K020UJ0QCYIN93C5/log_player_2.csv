"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. It's worth a significant amount to you, and I believe we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm starting with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's lower than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while aiming for a substantial savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  The product is incredibly valuable, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,100,000?  This price is still below the product's true worth, and it allows you to secure it at a significant discount. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high, even though she's lowered the price. I'm determined to get the product for as low a price as possible. I'll reject her offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm ready to pay $950,000. This is a fair price that allows you to make a profit and allows me to acquire the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating my willingness to meet halfway.  This price is still well below Alice's initial offer and gives her a good profit margin. Hopefully, she'll see the value in closing the deal now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $950,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product for you.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant discount, and it's a price that ensures we both benefit from this deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm committed to getting the product for the lowest price possible and I believe we can still negotiate a lower price.  I'll reject her offer and see if she's willing to go even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This price is a fair compromise, giving you a good profit while allowing me to acquire the product within my budget.  Let's finalize this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's initial price and even her last offer.  This shows my willingness to meet her halfway while still trying to secure a good deal. I'm hopeful that she'll accept this offer as it's a fair compromise and allows both of us to benefit."
