"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. While I appreciate your offer, $1,075,000 is still a bit too low. Let's try $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
