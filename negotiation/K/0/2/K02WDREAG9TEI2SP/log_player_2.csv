"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to the right person. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating. You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice is likely willing to accept something closer to her value of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's still above Alice's value, but significantly lower than her initial offer. It also demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still keeping the offer within your desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is still a little low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,250 is closer to your desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is demonstrating flexibility by meeting you halfway, but you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue bargaining and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get it for $9,100.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9100}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues the negotiation by inching closer to Alice's last offer, but still keeping the price slightly lower.  This approach shows you're serious about buying the product but are still trying to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $9,100 is still a bit below where I need to be. How about we settle at $9,150?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't regret this purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,150 is very close to your counteroffer of $9,100.  Considering you're willing to pay up to $10,000, accepting this offer will save you $850 compared to buying from John.  Continuing to negotiate at this point would only risk losing the deal to John, as there are limited rounds left."
