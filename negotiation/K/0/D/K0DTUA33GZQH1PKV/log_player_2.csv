"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $950,000 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's no harm in rejecting the first offer and seeing if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000.  This would still give you a good profit, and it aligns better with my budget.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's a significant step down from Alice's initial offer. This is intended to show Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating a lower price. The message also highlights the potential profit for Alice and frames the offer as being within Bob's budget. This should encourage Alice to consider a counter-counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $900000. This price still allows for a significant profit for me, and it's closer to your offer.  Let's find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $850,000. While Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to reduce her price further. There's no need to rush into a deal at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering a price that's exactly halfway between his last offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise but also demonstrates that he's still aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial asking price. This should encourage Alice to consider the offer, as it provides a reasonable middle ground."
