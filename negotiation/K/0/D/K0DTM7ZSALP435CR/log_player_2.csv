"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its intrinsic value and the benefits it offers, I understand its worth to you might be perceived at $1,200,000. My offer to you is to consider this remarkable item for a purchase price of $1,000,000. This represents a significant investment on your part, but I assure you, the return on this investment will far exceed the cost. I am confident that you will find immense value in this product, just as many others have before you. Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if you need any additional information to make a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. Rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a better price or simply proceed with buying from John and saving $200,000."
