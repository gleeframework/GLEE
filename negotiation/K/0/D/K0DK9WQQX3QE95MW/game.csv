"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is a significant step down from my initial proposal.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe $1,225,000 is a more reasonable compromise.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't go as low as $1,175,000. How about we settle on $1,200,000? This reflects my desire to reach a deal while still acknowledging the product's true worth.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not convinced. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1,150,000? I'm getting close to walking away, but I still think this product has potential.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
