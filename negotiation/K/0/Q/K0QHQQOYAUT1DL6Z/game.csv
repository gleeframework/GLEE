"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10200. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price point. I'd be willing to go up to $9800, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $12000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's my final offer. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",9500.0,Bob,6,
