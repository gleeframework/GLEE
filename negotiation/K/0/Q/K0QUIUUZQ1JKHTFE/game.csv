"Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm very interested, but $1500000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to consider $1200000? I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still very confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1350000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1350000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1250000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1300000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
