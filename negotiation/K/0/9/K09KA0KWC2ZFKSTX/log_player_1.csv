"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to close the deal quickly, $850,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects the value this product holds for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $900,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I believe there's room for more negotiation, and I'm determined to get as close to my desired price as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $900,000 still isn't quite meeting my needs.  How about we split the difference at $925,000? This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it reflects the value this product holds for you."", ""product_price"": 925000}
