"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I think it's worth $100 to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point considering Bob values the product at $120. 
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By stating that I ""think"" it's worth $100, I'm implying that I'm open to a lower price if Bob makes a compelling counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not ideal:** While $90 is better than my minimum of $80, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **More room for negotiation:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding John:**  Selling to John for $80 is the last resort, and I'm not desperate yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $95 is my lowest price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offer with justification:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and justifying my counter-offer with a reason (willing to come down a bit).
* **Meeting halfway:**  $95 is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer.
* **Staying firm:** I'm making it clear that $95 is my bottom line for now."

Round 4

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is close to my minimum:**  While $85 is only $5 above my minimum of $80, I still want to see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for higher counter-offer:**  I believe I can convince Bob to go slightly higher with another counter-offer. 
* **Avoiding John for now:**  I'm not desperate to sell to John yet, as I have several rounds left to negotiate with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's position:** Showing I'm listening to his concerns.
* **Compromise:**  Offering a middle ground between my previous offer and his current offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $87.50 is very close to my minimum of $80, I still want to see if I can get a slightly better price.
* **Potential for a small increase:** There's a chance Bob might be willing to go up just a bit more, especially since we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Avoid selling to John:** With only 4 rounds left, I'm not willing to settle for John's offer yet.  I want to see if I can close the deal with Bob at a slightly higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Explanation:**

* **Final compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a small increase from Bob's last offer, indicating I'm willing to make one final compromise.
* **Clear statement:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Highlighting the value:**  While I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, I'm still emphasizing the value of the product.

With only 3 rounds left, I'm aiming to finalize the deal with Bob at a price slightly above my minimum.  The pressure is on Bob to accept or risk losing the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me one last time, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $86. Would that be the final price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision. 
* **Close to my minimum:**  $86 is only $6 above my minimum of $80, so it's a good deal considering the limited time.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** There's a high risk that Bob might not accept another counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer of $80. 

I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure a sale at a price that's still profitable for me, even though it's not my ideal outcome."
