"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$12,000 is still too high for Bob.  It's worth exploring a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price down as much as possible.  Offering $9,000 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price while still leaving some room for negotiation. This should make Alice consider the offer seriously, especially considering the product is only worth $8,000 to her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, Bob can still do better. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Alice's offer is getting closer, but Bob is still hoping to get a better price. A counteroffer of $9,500 is a compromise that shows Bob is willing to negotiate, but still aims for a price that is closer to his ideal range."
