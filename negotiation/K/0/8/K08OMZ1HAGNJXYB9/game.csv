"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it offers.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,500,000 is out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand your position, but the product's value is truly significant.  I could come down to $1,350,000. I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
