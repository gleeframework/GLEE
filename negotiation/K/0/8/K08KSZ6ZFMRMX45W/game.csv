"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider your offer. However, I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. Therefore, I propose we settle on $107 for the product. This would allow us both to be satisfied with the transaction.",107.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $107 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on $105.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it will make us both happy with the transaction.",105.0,Bob,4,
