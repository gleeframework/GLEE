``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation to reach a price closer to Bob's value of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your product has value, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $15000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $12000? I appreciate your understanding. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer. $12,000 is still a bit lower than my desired price point, and I believe I can get closer to my ideal price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're working within a budget. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it ensures we both get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12500}
