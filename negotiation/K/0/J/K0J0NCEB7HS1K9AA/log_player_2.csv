{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way over your budget. You should reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  You're willing to pay up to $1,000,000, but you don't want to pay that much yet. You want to see if you can get a better deal from Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not going to pay a price that's unreasonable for me."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget. Although I'm close to my limit, I'm not willing to go over it. I've already made a significant counteroffer and Alice is still unwilling to budge much. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John and avoid further negotiations."
