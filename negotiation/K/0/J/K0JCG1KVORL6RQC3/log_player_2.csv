"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer you a great deal on it. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for less from John, so there's no reason to accept a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target, he can still get the product for cheaper from John.  There's no need to rush into a deal that's not the best possible outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? It's a good compromise and allows us to both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product holds for me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice has come down in price, but she's still above Bob's target price of $8,000. John is offering the product for exactly what Bob wants to pay, so there's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice."
