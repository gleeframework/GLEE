Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $900,000. This gives me a potential $100,000 profit over selling it to John. 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Minimizing risk:** While I want to maximize profit, I also want to minimize the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. A $900,000 offer is likely attractive to him, but not so high that it becomes unreasonable.
* **Information asymmetry:** I don't know Bob's valuation of the product, so I'm taking a calculated risk with this offer. 
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing John's offer of $800,000 gives me a floor price, ensuring I won't settle for less. 

By offering $900,000, I aim to balance maximizing potential gains with the possibility of a successful sale to Bob."
