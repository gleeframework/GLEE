Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I can still try to get closer to my target price of $100.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I can always sell to John if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
I'm offering $95. It's a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price, and it gives us both room to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is getting closer to my lower limit of $100, I still believe I can get a better price. There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm sticking to my guns and offering $90 again. This time, Bob's offer was even lower, so hopefully, he'll realize it's worth negotiating a bit closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  Bob's offers are getting progressively lower, and it's clear he's not willing to budge much.  I'm not willing to go lower than $90, and with only four rounds left, it's not worth risking getting stuck with a lower price.  John is a sure bet for $100, which is my minimum acceptable price."
