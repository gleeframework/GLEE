Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my profit.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer to $18,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but still keeps me above my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is better than selling to John for $15,000.  I'm accepting his offer to secure the sale and avoid further negotiation."
