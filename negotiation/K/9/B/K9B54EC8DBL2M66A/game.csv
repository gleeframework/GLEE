"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for $1800000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1800000 is way out of my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 for it.  Let me know if that's a number that works for you.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1000000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $1400000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1400000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000, but that's my absolute maximum.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
