"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $92.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product.",92.5,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  How about we settle right at $90? That's a fair deal for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to sell it to you for $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $91. It's a small compromise, but I think it's worth it for the value you'll get from this product.",91.0,Alice,5,
