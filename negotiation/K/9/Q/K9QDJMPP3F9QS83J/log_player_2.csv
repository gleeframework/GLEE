"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for it. This is a special offer tailored just for you, considering its worth to you is $100. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Alice's offer is $95, which is still above your ideal price point. You can get the product from John for $100, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John will save you $5."
