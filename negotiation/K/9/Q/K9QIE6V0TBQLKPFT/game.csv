"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm getting closer to your offer, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $1,250,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think about other opportunities, though...",1250000.0,Alice,5,
