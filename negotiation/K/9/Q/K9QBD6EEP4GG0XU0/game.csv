"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $110. I'm willing to consider it, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. It's a great product, and I think it's worth a bit more than that. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $125, so I'll offer you $127.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",127.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the compromise. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125 again? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,6,
