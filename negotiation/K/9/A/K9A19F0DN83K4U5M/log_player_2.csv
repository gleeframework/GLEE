Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to the price you're willing to pay, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'll give you a slight discount, and I'll offer it to you for $87.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

While we could continue to negotiate, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $87.50. Accepting this offer gets us the product at a price significantly lower than John's $120."
