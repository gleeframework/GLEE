"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $8000, which would be $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll meet you halfway from $10500, which would be $10250. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's my final offer. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $9500, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'll make one more compromise. I'll meet you halfway from $10500, which would be $10250. I'm willing to accept $10250 as my final offer. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but I'm not going any higher. If you're not willing to sell it to me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to look elsewhere. Is there any wiggle room at all?",9500.0,Bob,8,
