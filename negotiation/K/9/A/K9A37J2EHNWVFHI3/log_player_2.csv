"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price of $9,000. This is a one-time opportunity to acquire a valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product.
* Alice's offer is $9,000, which is less than your maximum but still higher than what it's worth to her ($8,000). 
* You can get the product from John for $10,000.
* Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $10,000 will save you money."
