"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is a bit high for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $650,000. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However,  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $725,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and offer it to you for $775,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000 to get this done.  Do you think that would work?",750000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to make one more adjustment, and offer it to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,7,
