{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $11,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you're willing to be flexible. If Bob rejects it, I'll be ready to analyze his counteroffer and make a decision based on how much I'm willing to drop to close the deal. Remember, I can always go to John for $12,000!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000 and also below my initial offer.  It's worth exploring if we can meet somewhere in the middle. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, but still acknowledging Bob's interest.  I'll keep John as a backup option in case negotiations fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work.  Let me know if you're interested in this price. "", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $11,000. I'm still a bit hesitant, so I'd like to make a new offer of $10,800. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, his offer is still below my desired price.  I'll counter again to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable number. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I still believe a deal with Bob is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go down to $11,200. This is a fair price considering the value of this product, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new offer of $10,900. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum threshold, and I've already made several concessions.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob,  my goal is to get the best possible price, and John offers a guaranteed $12,000.  It's time to move on and secure a more favorable deal."
