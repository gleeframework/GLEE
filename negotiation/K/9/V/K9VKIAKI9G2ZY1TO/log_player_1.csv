Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd make:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The ""Zone of Possible Agreement"" (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal can happen are between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you're in a strong position.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair offer for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but within reason:**  This price is significantly above Bob's perceived value, but the message frames it as a premium product.
* **Confident Language:**  The message is assertive without being aggressive. It highlights the product's value.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While you have a strong alternative, starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob counters.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or reject it outright. You can then decide if you want to negotiate or proceed with John."
