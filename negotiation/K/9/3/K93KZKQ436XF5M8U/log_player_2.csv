"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about $85? I think that would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $87.50. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $87.50 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than your ideal price.  You have several rounds left, and there's still room to negotiate.  It's worth trying for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $87.50 is closer, I'm still hoping to find a price that works better for my budget. How about $86? I think that's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 86}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to work with you, Bob! I can offer the product to you for $88. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product at this price. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, $88 is still a bit high. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if you can get closer to your ideal price. You still have several rounds left and John is always an option if you can't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. I'm still hoping for a price that's closer to my budget. Would you consider $87? I think this is a reasonable price, and we can both close the deal."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go all the way down to $87, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $89? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $89, which is only $9 above your ideal price. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away, or you running out of rounds.  Buying from John for $100 is also a possibility, but it's a much worse deal than accepting Alice's offer at this point.  Accepting $89 is the most sensible option."
