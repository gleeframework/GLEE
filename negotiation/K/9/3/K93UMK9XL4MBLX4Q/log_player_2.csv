"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to let it go for $100.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to get a good deal, Bob. I can do $92, but that's as low as I can go.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I can meet you at $90, but I think you'll really like the product, and I'm willing to go a bit higher if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $90 secures a good price and avoids the risk of the deal falling through."
