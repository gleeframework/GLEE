```

* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's worth to me to build its perceived value for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm leaving the door open for discussion, indicating flexibility. 
* **Setting the Stage:** This first offer establishes a clear starting point for negotiations."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While I'm open to negotiation, $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Room for Compromise:**  I believe there's still room to reach a deal closer to my desired price.
* **Staying Strong:**  Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm serious about getting a fair price and won't settle for anything less than what the product is worth to me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. The product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price, but still shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a clear reason for my counteroffer, referencing the value of the product and the need for a fair deal.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:** I'm stating that this offer represents a compromise and a win-win scenario.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is only $50,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is Money:**  We are already in the 4th round, and negotiating further could risk losing the deal entirely or running out of rounds.
* **Potential for Future Deals:**  Accepting this offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise, which could potentially lead to future deals with Bob. 
* **John's Offer:** While John is offering a higher price, I don't want to risk losing a potential buyer and a possible future relationship with Bob."
