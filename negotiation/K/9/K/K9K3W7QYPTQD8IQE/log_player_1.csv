Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're positioned to gain."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Strong Initial Offer:** A strong initial offer shows I value the product and understand its worth.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob is highly motivated as the product is worth significantly more to him than my minimum price.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  I have a safety net with John, ensuring I won't be forced to accept an offer below $800,000."
