"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product considering its value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I can offer the product to you for $10500. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",10500.0,Alice,7,
