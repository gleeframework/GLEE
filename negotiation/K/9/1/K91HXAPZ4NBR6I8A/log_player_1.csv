Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we settle right in the middle at $1,175,000?  That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is getting close to John's standing offer, we still have four rounds of negotiation.  Bob is clearly motivated and seems to be moving closer to our desired price range.  A firm rejection now might encourage him to come up higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting very close. $1,175,000 is a tempting offer, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. To make this work, I'd need a final offer at $1,220,000."",
""product_price"": 1220000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're down to the final rounds of negotiation, so increasing the pressure on Bob is key.
* **Small Concession:** We've only come down $5,000, signaling that we're near our limit.
* **""Final Offer"" Language:** By framing this as a ""final offer,"" we're adding weight to our position and encouraging Bob to make a serious decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer, take it or leave it.  $1,190,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,190,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could push Bob further in the remaining rounds, his ""final offer"" language and the fact that his offer is only $10,000 below John's makes accepting the deal the safest option.
* **Profitable Outcome:** $1,190,000 is still a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and allows us to use the funds sooner."
