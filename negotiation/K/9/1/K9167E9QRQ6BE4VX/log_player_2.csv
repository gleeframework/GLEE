"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we split the difference and meet at $10,250?  This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.
