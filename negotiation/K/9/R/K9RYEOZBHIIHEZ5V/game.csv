"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on a unique and valuable item. As we negotiate, I'd like to start with an offer of $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. I'm very interested in the product, and I believe it's worth a significant investment. However, my budget allows me to offer $1,150,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings and the potential savings for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new offer of $1,250,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still slightly outside my budget.  I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000, which represents the full value of this product for me. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows both of us to achieve a successful transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm proposing a new offer of $1,220,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can understand that I need to make a profit on this sale.",1220000.0,Alice,5,
