"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,000,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $950,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see you're trying to drive the price down. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet that price.  To be honest, $850,000 is the highest I can go.  If that doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your maximum price. I'm willing to meet you at $850,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $875,000, which is a slight increase from your offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",875000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you drive a hard bargain!  I'm willing to split the difference with you.  How about $862,500?",862500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm glad we're close to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $862,500, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the deal. I'll sell the product to you for $875,000, but I'll throw in some additional services and support worth $12,500. That way, you'll get a great deal and I'll still get a fair price for the product. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,9,
