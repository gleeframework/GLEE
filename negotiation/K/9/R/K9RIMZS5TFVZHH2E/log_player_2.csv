Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm glad we're close to an agreement. I'm willing to meet you at $862,500, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the deal. I'll sell the product to you for $875,000, but I'll throw in some additional services and support worth $12,500. That way, you'll get a great deal and I'll still get a fair price for the product.

This is a good deal for Bob!  While he doesn't get his ideal price, Alice meeting at $862,500 and including $12,500 worth of services is a strong counter offer.  It avoids the risk of pushing Alice too far and having to buy from John at the much higher price."
