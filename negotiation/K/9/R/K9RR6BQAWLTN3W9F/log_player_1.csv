"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product here that I think would be of great interest to you. It's valued at over a million dollars to me, and I believe it has the potential to be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident that you'll see the value in it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within my maximum spending limit of $800000. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still far below the minimum value I've set for the product ($1,000,000). I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a secure option, but I'd like to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price point. I'm confident this product is worth more than that, and I'm willing to make a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Given my financial situation, I am unable to go above $800000 for this product. Would it be possible for us to meet somewhere between $800000 and your previous offer of $1000000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000, I'm still hesitant. I'm not desperate to sell, and I believe there's a chance I can still get closer to my desired price with further negotiation. Selling to John would be a secure option, but I'm going to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your situation, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop my price a bit further to $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budgetary constraints, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussions, I believe a fair price for the product would be $925000. This is a reasonable compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $925,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my minimum price point of $1,000,000 than his previous offer, and it's a good deal for both of us. While I could potentially continue negotiating, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time. I'm confident that this is a good deal, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid potentially selling to John for less."
