"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than Alice's perceived value of $12,000.  There's room for negotiation, and Bob can try to get a lower price by rejecting the initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's value of $12,000. A counteroffer of $13,000 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, leaving potential for further compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is now closer to Bob's target.  It's still a bit more than Alice's perceived value, but it's within a reasonable range. Continuing to negotiate might get a slightly lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will get more stubborn or that Bob might lose the deal altogether. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price, saving him $1,500 compared to buying from John."
