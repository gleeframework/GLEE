Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing [product name] that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $200 for it, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $150 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While I would be happy to sell the product to Bob for $150, I believe it's worth more than that.  I will try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I also need to ensure I get a fair price for this product. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget, so I can only go up to $160. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $160 is still lower than what I'd prefer, it's getting closer to my desired price, and it's better than selling to John for $150.  It's also a good price for Bob, and I want to close the deal."
