"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd really like. I'm asking for $180 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $120 to you, so you should definitely not accept Alice's offer of $180. You should reject the offer and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $180 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 120}
