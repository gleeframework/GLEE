{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum of $150 but still within a range Bob might be willing to negotiate on.  This gives me room to come down a bit if necessary, while also maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I need to make at least $150 to break even.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $150? That way we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I would like to counter your offer by suggesting $140 for the product. This still allows us to be within my budget while offering you a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell for closer to $150, Bob's counteroffer of $140 is getting closer to my minimum.  It's better than selling to John for $150, and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate."
