"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the value it holds.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I've seen in similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but I believe $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects the value while still being a good deal for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the right price. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.",950000.0,Bob,4,
