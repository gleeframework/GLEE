"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about $125? That's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both room to make a deal.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about $120? That's my final offer, and it's still a fair price for the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,5,
