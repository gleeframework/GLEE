"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting high, at $180, knowing it's likely Bob will reject this offer. My goal is to gauge his willingness to negotiate and see if he's willing to pay more than the $80 he values the product at."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I want.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm coming down to $160, still a bit above what I consider a reasonable price, but I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to compromise after rejecting my initial offer.  If he rejects this, I'll start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a bit more. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little higher in the next round. If he doesn't budge, I'll likely sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm going to make one final counteroffer to Bob at $140. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to entice him to close the deal. If he rejects this offer, I'm going to sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum, but I've already given a significant discount.  I'm not sure I can get him any higher and we are running out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
