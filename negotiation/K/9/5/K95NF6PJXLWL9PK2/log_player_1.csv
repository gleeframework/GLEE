Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price, as I know John is willing to pay that. This sets a clear baseline for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm eager to sell, $90 is significantly below my minimum.  I'll counteroffer to try and find a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering $110, which is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. While $95 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offers, it's still below my target. John is offering my minimum, so I'll secure that sale."
