Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price higher than John's offer ($15,000) but low enough to entice Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob counters. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message aims to gauge Bob's interest and encourage a response. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit from Bob while having the security of John's offer."
