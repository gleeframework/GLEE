"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this incredible product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not there yet.  Let's split the difference:  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a unique product, and I believe it's worth every penny.",1020000.0,Alice,5,
