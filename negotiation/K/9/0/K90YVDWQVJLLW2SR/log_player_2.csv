"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's within your budget, but you can likely get a better price.  There's no need to rush into a deal, especially since you have a backup option with John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this incredible product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm determined to get the best possible deal.  I'm confident I can negotiate a lower price with more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not there yet.  Let's split the difference:  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This feels like a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a unique product, and I believe it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and is now only $20,000 above my ideal price. This is a good deal for me, considering I still have some wiggle room before hitting my budget limit. It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal, especially since I have a backup option with John. Accepting the offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price without having to go through more rounds of negotiation."
