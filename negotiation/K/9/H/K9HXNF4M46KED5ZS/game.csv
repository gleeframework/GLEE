"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking to receive while still allowing me to acquire the product within my financial limits.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $750,000 is significantly below my minimum.  To make this work, I'd need to see it closer to my initial ask. How about we meet halfway and settle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
