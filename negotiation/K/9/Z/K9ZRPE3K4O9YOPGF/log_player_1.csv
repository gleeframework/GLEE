Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, selling to Bob at a slightly lower price could still yield a significant profit.
* **Finding a Balance:**  The price of $1,350,000 is chosen strategically. It's substantially higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Creating Urgency:** The message implies that Bob has a limited-time advantage before the offer goes to someone else, potentially motivating him to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk that Bob might reject this offer, leading me to sell to John at the guaranteed price. However, the potential for earning an extra $150,000 by selling to Bob makes this calculated risk worthwhile."
