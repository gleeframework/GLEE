I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. I believe it's a strong starting point that shows I value the product while also being open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter-offer. While his offer meets my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price."

I'm lowering my price to $1,400,000. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further lowering my price and potentially ending up with a worse deal than John's offer is too high.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000 to ensure I get at least my minimum."
