Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,850,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you have significant leverage to aim high. Starting at $1,850,000 leaves room for negotiation while potentially securing a much higher profit.
* **Scarcity tactic:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency and competition, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
* **Value Emphasis:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message emphasizes the product's worth and potential, subtly justifying the high price.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is potentially open to paying a premium for exclusivity and a high-value product. 
* **Negotiation skills:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have room to go down while still making a significant profit over your guaranteed offer."
