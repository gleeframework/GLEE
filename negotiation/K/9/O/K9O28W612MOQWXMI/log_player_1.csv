"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for $900,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This initial offer is aggressive, aiming for a good profit. However, it leaves room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers.  I'm also being friendly and open to discussion, which can build rapport and help secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my desired price, it's not drastically unreasonable. I'm willing to negotiate further, as I have 8 rounds left. Selling to John now would guarantee $800,000, but I believe I can potentially get a higher price by continuing negotiations.  

In the next round, I'll counter with a price closer to his offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position. While $750,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm happy to accept $825,000 for the product.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** This counteroffer shows flexibility while still aiming for a good profit. It's a significant compromise from my initial offer but remains above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).  
* **Messaging:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's position, indicating willingness to negotiate, and emphasizing my compromise to highlight the fairness of the offer. This can encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Maintaining Negotiation Power:**  I still have 7 rounds left. If Bob rejects this offer, I have room to adjust my price again, but I want to get closer to a deal this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm prepared to pay $800,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  Although I had hoped for a higher price, there are only 6 rounds left, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. 

Accepting this offer guarantees me the minimum I'm willing to sell for, securing a successful sale."
