"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $15,000 would be a fair price for this product. Could we possibly meet at this amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reason: Bob is firmly set on $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result. Accepting John's offer avoids further haggling and guarantees the sale at my minimum."
