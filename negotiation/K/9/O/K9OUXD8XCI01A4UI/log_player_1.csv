{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $175. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and still potentially make a profit. I'm also trying to frame the offer as a win-win situation to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $120 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am still unable to meet the price of $140. I am willing to pay up to $130 for it. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $150, I'm choosing to sell to John to ensure I get my minimum desired profit."
