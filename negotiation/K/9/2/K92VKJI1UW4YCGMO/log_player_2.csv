"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is higher than my maximum valuation and significantly higher than what John offers. I should try to negotiate a better price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** I'm aiming to pay as little as possible, so I'm starting with an offer closer to Alice's valuation.
* **Polite and reasonable:** While low, the offer isn't insulting and acknowledges Alice's initial price. This sets a collaborative tone for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I've left space to increase my offer in subsequent rounds if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $100 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is negotiating, which is good. While $115 is better than her initial offer, it's still above my ideal price. I have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Alice's price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $110 positions me well. It's a significant jump from my previous offer, suggesting I'm serious, but still leaves me room to negotiate up to $115 if needed.
* **Simplicity:** A clean, round number like $110 can sometimes make an offer more appealing."
