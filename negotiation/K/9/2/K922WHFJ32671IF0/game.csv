"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate further.  How about $1,350,000? This price still allows you a good profit margin, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
