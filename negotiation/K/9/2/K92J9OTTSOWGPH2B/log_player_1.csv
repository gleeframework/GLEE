Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and leaves potential for a good profit while still being within the realm of reason. If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest based on his counteroffer and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my starting price and falls below my minimum acceptable value.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $900,000. This is still above my minimum value, and is a significant compromise from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a higher price, his counteroffer is still below my minimum acceptable value.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $800,000. This guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
