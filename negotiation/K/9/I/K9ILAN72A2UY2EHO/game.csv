"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $15500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fair price for such a unique item. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,3,
