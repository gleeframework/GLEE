This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than my minimum value, leaving room for potential bargaining. I've also included a friendly message to encourage a positive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $1,400,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  I'm proposing $1,750,000 as a compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $1750000 is a compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider $1600000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I believe this is a reasonable compromise and I'm willing to accept it."
