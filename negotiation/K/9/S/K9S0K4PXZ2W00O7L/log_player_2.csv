"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,500.** This is a better price than John's offer of $10,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save money.** Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John.
* **Even though the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, this is irrelevant to Bob's decision.**  Bob's only concern is getting the best price possible within his budget."
