"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential for your business, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true value. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, the price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 to start negotiations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognize your perspective on the initial price. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product will bring to your business.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,800,000 is still too far from what I had in mind. To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to the $1,000,000 mark. If you can make a more significant adjustment, I'm happy to continue discussing.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  To demonstrate that, I'm proposing a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant move on my part and reflects my genuine desire to do business with you.  Do you think we can work with this?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement, but I'm afraid we're at an impasse. My budget is firm, and to be completely transparent, I have another offer for $1,000,000. I'm willing to walk away from that and close with you right now for that same price.  If that's not possible, I'll need to pursue the other opportunity.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
