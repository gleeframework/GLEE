{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

With only 3 rounds left, I'm getting closer to my minimum. This offer is still above my minimum, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping that with fewer rounds remaining, Bob will be more likely to accept."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,600.

With only two rounds left, the chances of getting a better offer from Bob are getting slim. It's not worth the risk of losing more time and potentially ending up with a lower price.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees I meet my minimum and avoid further risk."
