"Alice, your offer is a great starting point, but I'm looking to invest in a product with a higher return. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in this product and is a fair deal for both of us. Let's make this happen.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, we're not willing to go as high as $1,100,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value we believe the product holds, but we're willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my potential purchase from John. Let's work together to reach a deal that benefits both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We're still not willing to go as high as $1,075,000. However, we're willing to make one more compromise. We're willing to offer $1,062,500. This is the highest price we're willing to consider, and we believe it's still a fair deal considering the value of the product.",1062500.0,Alice,5,
