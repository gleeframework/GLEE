Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you at a special price of $11,500.  This is a limited-time offer, so let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, getting Bob to buy it for a slightly lower price still yields a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $11,500 is a strong starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Time Pressure:** Creating a sense of urgency with a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Value Highlighting:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value and potential demand, subtly justifying the high price."
