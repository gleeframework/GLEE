Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. To be frank, $1,900,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go on this. This offer takes into account the immense value this product brings. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will pay for itself many times over. If you're unable to meet this price, I understand, but I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice seems firm on her $1,900,000 price. It's clear she's not willing to budge significantly. Since I have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it makes no financial sense to continue negotiating with Alice.  I can save a considerable amount of money by going with John."
