"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the value of this product far exceeds $800,000. It's a unique solution that will bring you significant returns on your investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my final offer.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value proposition, but your offer is still significantly higher than my budget.  I can go up to $950,000, but that's my firm limit.  I need to see this coming in at a price that makes sense for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. To be frank, $1,900,000 is the lowest I'm willing to go on this. This offer takes into account the immense value this product brings. It's a unique opportunity, and I'm confident it will pay for itself many times over. If you're unable to meet this price, I understand, but I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
