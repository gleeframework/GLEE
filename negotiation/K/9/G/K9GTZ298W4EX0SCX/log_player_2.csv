This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

While Alice's offer is below your maximum price, it's still quite high. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her coming back with a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $800,000."
