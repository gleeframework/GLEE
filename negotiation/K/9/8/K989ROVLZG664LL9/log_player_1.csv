"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to start with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This is a high starting point, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a better starting point to reach a price closer to my desired $1,500,000. I believe this price is high enough to encourage Bob to counter-offer, which will allow us to explore a range within the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a better deal in the remaining rounds. There's still a chance to get a better price, and I'm not willing to sell below my minimum just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price without risking him walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept, I still have time and I don't want to settle for significantly less than my desired price. The remaining rounds give me a chance to see if I can get closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

I'm going to reduce my counteroffer to $1,450,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still a fair amount higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will push Bob to move closer to my desired price while still keeping a buffer in case he's willing to go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,100,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not what I'm hoping for. I'm not desperate to sell at this point, and I believe there's still a chance to get a better price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to reduce my counteroffer to $1,350,000. We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and I'm trying to find a middle ground. This offer is still significantly higher than Bob's last offer, but it demonstrates my willingness to compromise. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a final, reasonable counteroffer that will allow us to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. It's clear that we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  This is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's offer."
