"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($1,050,000) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is closer to my walk-away price ($1,200,000 from John) while still leaving room for negotiation with Alice. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first counteroffer will help gauge Alice's flexibility and willingness to negotiate a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice's counteroffer of $1,300,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my walk-away price.
* **Leveraging John's Offer:**  Knowing I can get the product for $1,200,000 from John gives me bargaining power.
* **Aiming for a Better Deal:** I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Alice, closer to my $1,200,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $1,150,000.  Would that be workable for you?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This counteroffer aims to meet Alice halfway between her last offer ($1,300,000) and my previous offer ($1,050,000).
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm showing a willingness to move closer to her price, but I'm still a significant amount below her initial offer.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** I'm keeping the negotiation active and leaving room for a final agreement that's favorable to me."
