``` 

This offer is above Bob's valuation but still allows for potential negotiation and a profitable outcome for me. If he rejects, I'm prepared to counter his offer or walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,050,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $1,150,000.  Would that be workable for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, he's still significantly below my desired range.  The negotiation is taking longer than I'd like, and I'm confident that John will buy the product for a much better price.  I'll take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
