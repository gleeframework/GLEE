"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product brings, which is why I'm proposing $2,100,000. This price reflects its true worth and potential.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise for both of us.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I still think $2,100,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,050,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",2050000.0,Bob,4,
