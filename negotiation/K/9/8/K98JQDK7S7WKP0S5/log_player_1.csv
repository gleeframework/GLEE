Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your confidence in the product's value, but I still think $2,100,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $2,050,000. I believe this is a reasonable price considering the value it brings, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate and has now offered a price significantly above my minimum. Accepting this offer secures a great profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
