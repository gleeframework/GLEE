Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning he has a potential profit margin of $200,000.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer, which gives you leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that maximizes your profit while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept.  Going too high risks Bob rejecting the offer.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will far exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  The message starts by emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity, framing it as a desirable opportunity. 
* **Strategic Price:** $1,150,000 gives you a significant profit ($150,000) over your minimum and leaves Bob with a $50,000 profit margin. This price point makes it more likely Bob will accept rather than risk losing out entirely.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might try to negotiate further. Be prepared to adjust your price slightly, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum."
