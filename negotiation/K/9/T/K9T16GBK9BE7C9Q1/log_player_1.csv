This offer is above Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This allows for negotiation and a potential compromise. It also leaves me room to potentially make a counteroffer if Bob rejects this offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose an alternative at $1350000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome. I want to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired outcome.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get him to meet my price. If he rejects, I'm going to sell to John."
