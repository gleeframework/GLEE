"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $105. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best price, but $106 isn't quite there yet for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $107.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can make this deal work.",107.0,Alice,7,
