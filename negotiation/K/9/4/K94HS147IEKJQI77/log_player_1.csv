"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a higher price closer to $1 million, and I have 8 rounds left to explore that possibility. Selling to John now would guarantee $1 million, but I'm not willing to give up on the potential to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1 million. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. This is my final offer before considering other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Considering that I have only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate. Accepting this offer secures a sale that is within my acceptable range.  It's also possible that Bob is being sincere about considering other options if I reject this offer, which could lead to a worse outcome."
