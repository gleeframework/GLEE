Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's valuation will maximize your profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $120 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between a price attractive to Bob and maximizing your potential earnings."
