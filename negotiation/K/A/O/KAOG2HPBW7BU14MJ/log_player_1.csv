Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to go down to $12,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go to $12,500.  This is a fair price considering what I know about the product and what it's worth to you.
