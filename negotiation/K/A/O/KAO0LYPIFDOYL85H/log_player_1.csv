Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial offer. I'll counter and see if we can meet in the middle."

Bob's offer is close enough to my minimum that I'm comfortable accepting. While selling to John would guarantee me $1,000,000, I think I can get slightly more from Bob with this offer."
