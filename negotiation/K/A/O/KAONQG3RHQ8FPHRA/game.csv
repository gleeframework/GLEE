"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can we meet in the middle at $11500?",11500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $11500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, so I'll counteroffer at $12800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12800.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12000, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at $12000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
