"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of a price more around $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $110? I think that's a fair compromise.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $95? I'm really interested in the product and want to make a deal work.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to take a small step back, though. How about we try $105? I think that's a fair compromise.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we try $103? I think that's as low as I can go.",103.0,Alice,9,
