"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. Given its features and value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I believe it's a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product is worth significantly more to me. I could go down to $17,000.  Let me know if that works for you.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway.  However,  $15,000 is my absolute lowest price.  I have another buyer ready at that price, but I wanted to give you a chance first. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is unlikely to go below $15,000.  
* Your maximum value for the product is $10,000.
* John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000.

Continuing to negotiate with Alice is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay. Buying from John secures the product at your target price."
