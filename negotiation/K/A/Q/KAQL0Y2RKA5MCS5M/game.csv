"I understand you're interested in the product, but I was thinking it's worth a bit more than $90. I can do $110, but that's as low as I can go.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $100, which is the price I mentioned earlier that I was willing to sell it to John for. I think it's a fair price, considering the product's value.",100.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to meet you at $97.50, Bob. I think I've been flexible enough. I'm willing to sell it to you for $99, which is still a good compromise, but I'm not going any lower.",99.0,Alice,9,
