Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers excellent value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice's goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible, while still exceeding her minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer. This keeps the conversation going and gives Alice a chance to understand Bob's perspective.
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale with John at $12,000, ensuring she doesn't lose out."
