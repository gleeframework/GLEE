"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, but needs to be realistic.  Offering $10,500 is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to get a lower price. It's important for Bob to remember that John is always an option if the negotiation with Alice fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob and leaves room for Alice to profit, potentially leading to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than Bob wants to pay. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and it's possible to get a better price. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going, allowing Bob to continue trying to get a lower price.  It's important to note that buying from John is always a possibility, so Bob doesn't have to settle for an unsatisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer again, demonstrating his willingness to meet Alice halfway.  $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob, and it's closer to Alice's last offer. This strategy aims to push Alice towards accepting a price closer to Bob's desired range.  It's a calculated risk, as Alice could reject the offer, but the likelihood of reaching an agreement is increasing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob. While it's closer to his budget, there's still room for negotiation. There are only three rounds remaining, so Bob needs to be strategic. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to continue pushing for a lower price.  If Alice rejects his next counteroffer, Bob can still buy from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is Bob's final push to reach an agreement. $12,000 is a significant compromise for Bob, but it's still a good deal, and it shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product. With only two rounds remaining, Bob is taking a calculated risk. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will likely have to buy from John, which is not his preferred outcome. However, there's a good chance Alice will accept this offer, as it's closer to her desired price and she's likely tired of negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

There's only one round remaining.  Alice's last offer is still too high for Bob.  While he could try to counteroffer again, it's unlikely that Alice will budge in the final round. Buying from John ensures Bob gets the product within his budget, even though it's not the ideal price.  It's a strategic decision to avoid further negotiation and secure the product."
