Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and straightforward, emphasizing the potential value to Bob.
* **Strategy:** My goal is to start negotiations at a price that is appealing to Bob while still leaving room for further bargaining. This strategy aims to:
    *  Get Bob to consider the offer seriously.
    *  Avoid immediately triggering a rejection and entering a protracted negotiation.
    *  Keep the option open to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I want to maximize my profit, selling to John for $1,500,000 is always a viable option. Therefore, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. The product holds significant value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects a reasonable compromise and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm countering with $1,100,000. This price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product while demonstrating flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to:
    * Gauge Bob's willingness to compromise.
    * Keep the negotiation moving forward while maintaining a profitable selling price.
    * Position myself for further negotiation if Bob rejects again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $950,000? That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a step closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low. I'm unwilling to compromise that much, especially given the guarantee of $1,500,000 from John. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price, but $950,000 is still below what I can accept.  Given the value of the product, how about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $1,025,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,100,000 and Bob's current offer of $950,000. This demonstrates my willingness to meet him halfway. 
* **Message:** I emphasize ""fair compromise"" and ""finalizing the deal"" to show I'm ready to close the deal if he accepts.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer aims to:
    *  Signal a strong commitment to reaching an agreement.
    *  Make a price that's a strong compromise without sacrificing too much. 
    *  Put the pressure on Bob to either accept or risk losing the deal."
