"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. The product holds significant value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects a reasonable compromise and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about $950,000? That's a significant move on my part.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price, but $950,000 is still below what I can accept.  Given the value of the product, how about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to finalize the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
