Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. The product holds significant value. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This price reflects a reasonable compromise and allows both of us to benefit from the transaction.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move on the price, but $950,000 is still below what I can accept.  Given the value of the product, how about we split the difference and settle on $1,025,000?  This would be a fair compromise and allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

**Reasoning:** While Alice is trying to meet in the middle, it's clear she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,025,000.  John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000.  At this point, the potential savings of another round of negotiation with Alice are outweighed by the certainty of getting a good deal from John."
