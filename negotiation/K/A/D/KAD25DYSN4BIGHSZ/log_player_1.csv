Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $14,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility:** I'm open to counteroffers, but I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $13,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Higher:** While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price.
* **Negotiation Room:** I believe I can still get closer to my goal of $14,000 or even higher.
* **John as Leverage:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives me the power to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down to $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500? It's still a great deal for you and gets us closer to a deal. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by coming down from $14,000 to $13,500.
* **Motivating Factor:** The ""halfway"" approach makes it seem like a fair offer.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the positive aspects for Bob (still a good deal) and focusing on a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $13,200. This brings us closer to my budget while still providing a good value for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $13,200 is only $300 below my initial offer of $13,500 and within the range of my acceptable prices.
* **Time Efficiency:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to more back and forth, potentially taking longer and potentially lowering the price further.
* **Risk of John:**  If I keep rejecting offers, there's a chance Bob might walk away, and I might end up selling to John at a lower price than my initial counteroffer."
