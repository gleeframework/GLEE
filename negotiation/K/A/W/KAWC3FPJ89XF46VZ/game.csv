"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $11,000? This gives us both a fair deal, and I'm sure you'll still find the product valuable at that price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll still be very happy with the product at that price.",11500.0,Alice,5,
