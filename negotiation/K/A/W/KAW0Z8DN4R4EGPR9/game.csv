"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is still a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1350000. This is the best price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1450000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
