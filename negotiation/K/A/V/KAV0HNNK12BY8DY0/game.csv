"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm looking to sell it to you for $20000. I believe it's a great investment and I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product, but my budget is limited.  I'm willing to pay $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and features. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $18000, but that's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $15000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $15000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15000 and $18000, which would be $16500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still hesitant to go above $15000. Let's split the difference and agree on $15750. This would be a fair compromise, and I'd be ready to purchase the product immediately.",15750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as high as $15750. I'm still thinking of a price of $17000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and features, and I'm willing to sell it to you at this price. Let's finalize the deal at this point.",17000.0,Alice,7,
