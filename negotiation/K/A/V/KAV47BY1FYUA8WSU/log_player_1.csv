{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is above my minimum value of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  I believe it's a good starting point that acknowledges Bob's perceived value while giving me a strong chance to secure a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm prepared to pay $10000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is more than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves me with a smaller profit margin. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's a fair price that gives you a great deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
