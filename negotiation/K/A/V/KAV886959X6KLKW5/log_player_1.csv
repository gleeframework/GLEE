Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in your product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $17000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $17,000 is more than my minimum, I want to try and get closer to my initial asking price. Rejecting Bob's offer will allow me to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
