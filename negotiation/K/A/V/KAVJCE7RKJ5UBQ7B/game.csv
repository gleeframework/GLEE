"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for this product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to meet you at $750,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is the best I can do for now.",850000.0,Alice,5,
