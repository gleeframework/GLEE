{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $1,200,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a potential profit of $200,000 for Bob, making it a tempting offer. This price also secures a $200,000 profit for you, which is a significant gain compared to John's offer.

By starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's maximum valuation, you increase the chances of closing the deal quickly and for a higher profit than your fallback option."
