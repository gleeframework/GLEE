"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-end item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $25000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $25000 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $18000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $22000. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $22000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go to $20000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",20000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $20000. I can offer it to you for $21000. This is my best compromise so far, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",21000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm still interested, $21000 is a bit more than I can afford.  Let's split the difference and I'll go to $20500. This is a fair price, and I believe it will work for both of us.",20500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $20500. I can offer it to you for $20000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product.",20000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm genuinely interested in the product, but $20000 is still slightly out of my reach.  I'm willing to go to $19500, which is a very fair price for both of us.  I'm ready to close the deal at this price, but if we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to consider other options.",19500.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $19000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",19000.0,Alice,9,
