Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but it leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise. 

I'm aiming to maximize my profits while still keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation. If he rejects this offer, I can then gauge his interest and willingness to negotiate further before potentially moving to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. While selling to John for $1,200,000 is tempting, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation with Bob. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,000,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it demonstrates a willingness to compromise.  I believe it's a fair price that might incentivize Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm confident that I can get closer to my goal by continuing to negotiate. I'll reject his offer and try to reach a more favorable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm offering $950,000. This represents a compromise from my previous offer, but it still ensures a good profit for me. This is a strong offer that's likely to incentivize Bob to accept, especially considering he's already indicated a willingness to increase his offer."
