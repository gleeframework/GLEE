Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 900000} 

I'm going to start with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. My goal is to maximize my profit, and starting high gives me room to negotiate down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's counteroffer is still more than what I'd get from John. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a decent profit."
