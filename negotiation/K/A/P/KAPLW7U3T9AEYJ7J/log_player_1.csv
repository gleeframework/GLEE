Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.  
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""true worth,""  you aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value at a higher point.
* **Alternative:**  Keeping John's offer ($1,500,000) in mind gives you a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I understand the value you place on the product, my budget allows me to pay no more than $800,000 for it. I hope we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While his message suggests some room for negotiation, accepting $800,000 would be a substantial loss. It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a price closer to your target before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's significantly below the market value of this product and what I'm willing to accept.  To move things forward, I can reduce the price to $1,900,000. This is my final offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction but Firm:**  The large price drop signals flexibility while still staying significantly above Bob's initial offer.  
* **Finality and Alternatives:**  By presenting it as your ""final offer"" and mentioning ""other interested buyers"" (even if John is your only other option at the moment), you create urgency and leverage. 
* **Objective in Sight:** While still above your minimum, this price point allows for potential profit if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,900,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  While $1,200,000 is below your initial target, it's still a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has considerably increased his offer from $800,000, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer.  Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the possibility of having to settle for John's offer."
