# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I know it's worth at least $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, considering the value you place on it.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
