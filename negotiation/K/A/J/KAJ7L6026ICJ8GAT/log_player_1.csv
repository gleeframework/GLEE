"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming high initially to give myself room for negotiation and to gauge Bob's eagerness. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning ""potential"" subtly hints at the product's worth to Bob without revealing my bottom line.
* **Open to Discussion:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I invite him to engage in the negotiation process. 

This strategy allows me to gather information about Bob's willingness to pay while still aiming for a price close to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is quite good, I believe there's still room for negotiation. He's already willing to pay $100,000 over my absolute bottom line, indicating strong interest. I'll counter with a price closer to his perceived value to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations. However, $1,300,000 undervalues the product's true potential. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,375,000. This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I want to maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere by showing I've considered his proposal.
* **Standing Firm:** I'm not accepting his offer outright because I know the product is worth more to him. 
* **Compromise:** Suggesting a middle ground price of $1,375,000 aims to secure a significant portion of the potential profit while signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** Re-emphasizing the ""true potential"" subtly reminds Bob of the product's value and justifies the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my budget. I propose a price of $1,325,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product.  At $1,325,000, we're getting very close to his initial offer, and further haggling might risk alienating him. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit of $125,000 above my minimum, which is a very good outcome."
