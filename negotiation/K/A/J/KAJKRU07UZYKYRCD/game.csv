,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's still a good price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's make this happen!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,800, which is the highest I can go. I hope we can come to an agreement.",11800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint, but $11,800 is still a little too low for me.  If you're serious about getting this product, how about we settle for $12,200?  That's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to my budget, but I'm not willing to go above $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if you can meet me at this price. Can you do that?",12000.0,Bob,6,
