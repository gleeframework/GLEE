Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $2,000,000 is way above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you.  Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

**Reasoning:** 

Bob has incrementally increased his offer, but it's clear he's unlikely to meet your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  John offers a guaranteed sale at your desired price. It makes the most financial sense to take the guaranteed sale with John rather than risk Bob not reaching your minimum."
