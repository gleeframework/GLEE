Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal and you'll find it very valuable."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, even if it's just a bit. 
* **Appear Reasonable:**  While aiming high, starting at $140 seems like a reasonable offer compared to your fallback of $150, potentially making Bob more likely to consider it. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing your potential profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
