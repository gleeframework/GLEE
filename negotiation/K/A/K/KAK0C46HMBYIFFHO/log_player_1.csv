Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm offering Bob the product for $9,500. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is still a good price for Bob as he values the product at $10,000, and it's a bit closer to my original offer of $9,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm concerned that further negotiation with him will just drag this out and ultimately lead to a lower price.  Selling to John for $8,000 ensures a quick and guaranteed sale, even if it's slightly lower than Bob's last offer."
