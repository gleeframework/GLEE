"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a high number ($1,600,000), we aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he rejects this initial offer, it sets a higher baseline for subsequent discussions. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message emphasizes openness to discussion, signaling to Bob that we're willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative Option:**  While we don't mention John explicitly, knowing we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives us a strong fallback position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,500,000. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is a significant jump from his initial valuation of $1,000,000, indicating he's very interested. While $1,500,000 is tempting, we have room to negotiate and aim for a price closer to our target. We're still above our guaranteed sale price with John, so we can afford to push a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your understanding of the product's value.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,500,000 is still below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,550,000?"",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and make a concession by coming down from our initial price.
* **Middle Ground:** Offering a price in the middle aims to signal fairness and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Maintaining Value:** We haven't dropped below $1.5 million, reinforcing the product's significant worth. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only a few rounds left, we need to move towards a closing price. This offer keeps us in a strong position for the remaining negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,525,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** $1,525,000 is a very good offer. It's significantly above our guaranteed sale price with John and shows that Bob is serious about purchasing the product. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate for a slightly higher price (e.g., $1,530,000 or $1,535,000) might not be worth the risk of Bob walking away. The potential gain is small compared to the risk of losing the deal.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value. Prolonging negotiations could lead to missed opportunities elsewhere.

It's better to secure a strong deal now than to risk losing it for a marginal gain."
