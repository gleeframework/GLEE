"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $600,000 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While $1,000,000 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still a bit off.  Could you do $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a deal, Bob. However, $750,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
