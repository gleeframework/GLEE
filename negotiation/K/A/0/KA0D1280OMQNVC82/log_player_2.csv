"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your maximum budget is $15,000, and Alice is offering the product at exactly that price, there's no immediate advantage to buying from her.  Rejecting her offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with John, who is your backup option."
