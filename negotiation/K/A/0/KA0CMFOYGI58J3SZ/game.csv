"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,500. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget.  However, $11,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value it holds for me, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I place on the product, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to reach a deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,750. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,250. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
