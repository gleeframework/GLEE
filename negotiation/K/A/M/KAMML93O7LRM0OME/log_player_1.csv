Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special discounted price of $9,500. I believe it will be very valuable for you, even more so at this price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing my minimum acceptable price is $10,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $9,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting me closer to my ideal outcome.
* **Highlight Value:**  By mentioning a ""special discounted price,"" I'm emphasizing that he's getting a good deal, which might make him more inclined to accept.

Let's see if Bob goes for it!"
