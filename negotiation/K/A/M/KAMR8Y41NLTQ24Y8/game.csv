Thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the uniqueness of the item. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $8500.,8500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8500 just yet. I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to increase my offer to $8700. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",8700.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm still not convinced that $8700 is a fair price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $9500. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable, considering the value you've placed on the product.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I'm still not ready to sell at $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll offer it to you for $9500 is still too high for me, so I will offer it to you for $9200. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9200.0,Alice,7,
