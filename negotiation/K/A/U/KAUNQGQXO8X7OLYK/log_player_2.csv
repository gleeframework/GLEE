"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am offering you the product for $115. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $115. You're willing to pay up to $120, so there's room to negotiate. It's worth trying to get a better price before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $105? It's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose $110 as the price. This allows for a reasonable profit for me while still being a competitive price for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $110, which is still a good deal for you, considering your maximum is $120.  It's unlikely you'll get it much lower, so accepting is the best option."
