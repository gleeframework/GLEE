"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to drop my price to $1,150,000. It's a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
