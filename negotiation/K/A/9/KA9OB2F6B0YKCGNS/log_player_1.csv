Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $12,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to get as close to Bob's valuation as possible without exceeding it.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves a small window for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Backup Option:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob."
