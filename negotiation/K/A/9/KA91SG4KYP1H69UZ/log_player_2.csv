"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $12,000. This is a high-quality item that I believe would greatly benefit you based on its value to you, which I understand is $15,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's lower than John's price, it's still above Alice's own valuation. There's room for negotiation.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to Alice's value, saving him more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. I would like to propose a price of $11,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value you see in it and my valuation of the item. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** Alice's offer of $11,500 is very close to Bob's counteroffer of $11,000. This represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.
* **Limited upside:** There's a risk of further negotiation leading to a rejected counteroffer and potentially having to buy from John at a much higher price.
* **Time and effort:** Continuing the negotiation takes time and effort, and a deal at $11,500 is a good outcome for Bob."
