"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you coming down from your initial price, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value you place on it. Let me know if you're open to that.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After considering your offer, I am willing to negotiate further. I would like to propose a price of $11,500 for the product.
