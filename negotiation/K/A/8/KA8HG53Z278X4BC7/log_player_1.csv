"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 25000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Initial Message:**  I'm focusing on the potential value of the product to Bob.  This encourages him to consider its worth.
* **Room for Compromise:**  This offer leaves room for Bob to counter without me having to immediately drop my price too much. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first round.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but my budget is limited. Would you consider selling it for $18000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is a significant drop from my initial price, but it's still above my minimum. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John guarantees $15,000, I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can secure a better price from Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above his current offer. I'll try to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $22,000, but I can't go any lower than that. It's a fair price considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 22000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm lowering my price from $25,000 to $22,000, meeting Bob halfway from his offer of $18,000. This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a better price.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to reinforce its worth.
* **Finality:**  By stating ""I can't go any lower,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency and a potential deadline for Bob.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's true interest and willingness to pay. If he accepts, I've secured a reasonable price. If he rejects, I'll have a better understanding of his limits for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Could you consider selling the product for $20000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:** Bob's offer of $20,000 is getting closer to my desired price. It's a good compromise, and accepting it ensures a sale.
* **Time Constraint:** We're already in round 4, leaving fewer rounds to negotiate. Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of losing the sale altogether.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try for a slightly higher price, the possibility of further negotiation breakdown and ending up with John's lower offer isn't worth the risk. 

**Decision:**

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $20,000. This is a good outcome, considering my minimum price of $15,000."
