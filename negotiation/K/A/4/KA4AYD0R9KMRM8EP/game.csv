"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I can do $1200000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1350000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $1150000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can see you're serious about the product, so I'm willing to make a compromise. I can meet you at $1250000. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $1250000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go to $1200000, which I believe is a fair price considering my previous offers. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
