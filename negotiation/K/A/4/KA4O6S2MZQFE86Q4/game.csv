"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This price still allows me to cover my costs and hopefully, we can both be happy with the deal. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make a new offer of $9,800. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your persistence. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to go down to $10,000. This price is still fair considering the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
