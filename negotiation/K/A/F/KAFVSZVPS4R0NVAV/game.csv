"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $14,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
