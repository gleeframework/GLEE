Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering the negotiations so far, I would like to propose an offer of $16,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500

While we're still above John's offer, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $16,500 now secures a profit and avoids the risk of him dropping his offer further in later rounds."
