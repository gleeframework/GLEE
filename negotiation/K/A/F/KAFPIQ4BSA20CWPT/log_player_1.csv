"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I am willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with him in the next round, and if not, I'll always have the option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to my desired price but still within Bob's perceived value range. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the deal to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about $92 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because I still believe I can get a higher price.  He's getting closer to my desired price, but I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I'll counter with a slightly higher price in the next round, and if that doesn't work, I'll always have the option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  $94 for the product is my final offer. It's a great deal for both of us, and I don't want to lose this opportunity to work with you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 94} 
```

I'm offering a price that's very close to Bob's last offer, but still slightly higher. I'm emphasizing the finality of this offer to put pressure on Bob to accept. I'm also trying to appeal to his sense of fairness by suggesting a ""meeting halfway"" approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $93 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $93
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm only $1 away from my last offer.  While I'd prefer $94, I'm confident I can make up for the $1 difference in other ways.  Accepting Bob's offer is the most reasonable decision at this point.  I'm also concerned that if I reject his offer again, he might walk away, and then I'll be stuck selling to John at a lower profit margin."
