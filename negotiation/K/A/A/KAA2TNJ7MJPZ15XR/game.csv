"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,750?  It's a fair price, and it allows you to get the product for a good value while still giving me a fair deal. Let me know what you think!",10750.0,Alice,3,
