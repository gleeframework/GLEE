Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's how Alice should approach this offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice; this is her ""walk-away"" price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **John's Value (Guaranteed Sale):** Alice can sell the product to John for $1,500,000 if Bob declines.

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice knows she has a guaranteed sale at her minimum price. Therefore, she should aim to get as much as possible from Bob without going over Bob's $1,200,000 valuation.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Reasoning**

* **Price:** Offering the product just below Bob's valuation ($1,190,000) maximizes the chance of acceptance while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if John is the only other one) creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially prompting Bob to act quickly.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter-offer. 
* **Risk:** There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, but Alice has a guaranteed sale with John at her desired price."
