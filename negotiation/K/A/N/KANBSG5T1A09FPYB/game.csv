"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it has tremendous value, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1200000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a price of $1100000. This is a compromise that I think reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I hope we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm thinking of a price of $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to reach your target price, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $975000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've described, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm getting close to considering other options, but I still want to try to reach an agreement with you.",975000.0,Bob,6,
