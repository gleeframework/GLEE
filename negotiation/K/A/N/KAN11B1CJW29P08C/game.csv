"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I can offer it to you for $15,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $15,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,000?  I think this would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but the value of this product is substantial.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $13,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $11,000, which is a significant compromise.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,6,
