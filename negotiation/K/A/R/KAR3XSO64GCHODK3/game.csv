"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that you've expressed interest in. I'm asking $115 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I've done some research and I'm not sure it's worth $115.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This still leaves me with some profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $97.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
