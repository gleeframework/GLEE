"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $120. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than $80, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. Let's meet in the middle. How about $110?  That's still a great price for you, and it gets me closer to what I need. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $110. How about we meet at $95? I'm willing to pay that for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $95 is a decent price, it's still a bit too far from what I want. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $105. That's still a great deal for you considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your last offer, but I still think $105 is a bit high. How about we meet at $90? I'm willing to pay that for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is tempting, I believe I can still push for a higher price.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer to see if we can finally reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm getting a little frustrated with this back and forth.  I'm willing to come down to $100.  That's a fair price for both of us. Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but $100 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet at $85? I'm willing to pay that for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would like to get closer to my initial goal, I'm running out of time and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting Bob's offers, he might walk away entirely. Accepting $85 is still better than selling to John for $80."
