Round 4

We're getting closer, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  We'll see what happens in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your persistence. I've considered your offers and am willing to pay $17,000 for the product. This aligns more closely with my budget while still allowing me to acquire something valuable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,000

Bob is unlikely to go any higher, and $17,000 is a respectable profit. It's better to take this offer than risk him walking away in later rounds."
