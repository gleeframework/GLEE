# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll love it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

You can get the product from John for $100, which is lower than Alice's offer of $110.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John to save money."
