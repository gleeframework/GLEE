"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $950,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,075,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to my desired price point. Let's try to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I've reviewed your latest offer and while I appreciate your flexibility, I'm still not able to meet at $1,075,000.
