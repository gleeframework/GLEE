Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny of my asking price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage. Starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000) allows room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price. 
* **Exclusivity:** By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" it might make Bob more inclined to accept before you offer it to someone else. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is potentially receptive to a higher price if the perceived value is there.  
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a risk Bob will outright reject the offer, and you'll have to settle for John's $1,200,000. If you're risk-averse, a smaller initial markup might be wiser."
