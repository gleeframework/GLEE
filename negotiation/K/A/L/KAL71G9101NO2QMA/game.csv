"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe it would be a great addition to your operations.  My initial price is $1,400,000, reflecting its unique value and benefits.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $1,100,000 is unfortunately below the value I need to achieve. To bridge the gap and demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,250,000. I believe this offer is fair and reflects the product's value while remaining within a reasonable range for you. Let's keep the conversation going and see if we can finalize a deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget constraints. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, but I need a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm proposing $1,300,000.  This reflects the value I'm placing on the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.  Let's see if we can come to a final agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I propose $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget constraints. If this doesn't work, I may need to consider buying from John for $1,000,000.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
