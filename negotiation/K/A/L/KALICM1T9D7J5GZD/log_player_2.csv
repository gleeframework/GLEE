"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. I know it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is a significant discount and a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Alice's offer is a good deal. While you could reject hoping for a lower price, there's a risk she'll sell it to the other buyer. Accepting the $1,250,000 offer saves you $250,000 compared to John's price."
