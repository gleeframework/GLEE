Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what I would accept from John. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a $100 limit. Would you be willing to consider $150 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I would prefer to sell for more, Bob's offer is the minimum I am willing to accept. Selling to John for the same price would be pointless, as I would gain nothing from the negotiation process."
