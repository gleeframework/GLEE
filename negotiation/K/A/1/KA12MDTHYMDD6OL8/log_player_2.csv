"Round 1

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but her offer is already at $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation is worth trying.** There's a chance you can get a better price by making a counteroffer.  
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  John's offer is your upper limit, but you're better off trying to get a better deal with Alice first."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:** A $100,000 reduction from Alice's initial offer shows you're serious about negotiating.
* **Stay within your budget:** $900,000 is still within your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** Alice is likely to counter again, giving you another chance to find a middle ground."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Testing the waters:** By offering $1,000,000, you're seeing if Alice is willing to meet you halfway. If she rejects this offer, you'll likely buy from John.

* **John's offer is a safe bet:** Buying from John guarantees you'll get the product within your budget, even if it's not the absolute best deal.  Since there's no guarantee that you'll be able to reach an agreement with Alice in the final round, it's safer to purchase from John at this point."
