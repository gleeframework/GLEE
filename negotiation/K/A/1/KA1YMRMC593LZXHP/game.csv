"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140 to see if we can find common ground.  This is still a great value for you, and it gives me some room to work with. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $130 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about $135? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to close the deal. What do you say?",135.0,Alice,5,
