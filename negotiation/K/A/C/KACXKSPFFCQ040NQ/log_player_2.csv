Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.
