"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you our amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $100. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your desired price.**  You want to pay no more than $120, and Alice is asking for $100.
* **You have room to negotiate.**  Since you're willing to pay up to $120, there's a range for potential counteroffers.
* **It's early in the negotiation.** You have 10 rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting with a reasonable counteroffer:**  $90 is a significant decrease from Alice's $100, showing you're serious about negotiating. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This counteroffer still leaves some room for Alice to meet you halfway.
* **Being polite:**  Maintaining a friendly tone can help keep the negotiation going smoothly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your ideal price.**  You're aiming for $120, and she's offering $95.
* **There's still room to negotiate.** You've already gotten Alice to lower her price by $5, indicating she's willing to compromise.
* **It's still early in the negotiation.** You have 7 rounds left to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining your previous offer:** You've already shown a willingness to compromise, and staying firm with your counteroffer demonstrates your resolve.
* **Reinforcing your desired price:** By repeating your $90 offer, you emphasize your target price point. 
* **Keeping the communication friendly:**  Maintaining a polite tone can help keep the negotiation open and positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $90, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer is close to your desired price.** You want to pay no more than $120, and her offer is $92.
* **You have limited rounds left.**  You only have 5 rounds remaining, and there's a chance Alice won't budge further.
* **The risk of buying from John is higher.** While buying from John guarantees you'll get the product, you'll pay $28 more than Alice's offer. 

While you'd ideally get the product for $90, accepting Alice's final offer at $92 still saves you money compared to buying from John and allows you to secure the product with more rounds left in case you need to negotiate with another seller later."
