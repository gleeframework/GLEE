"Thank you for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $95. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $120. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $90, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $92. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",92.0,Alice,5,
