Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what it offers. Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By initially offering the product at $10,000, Alice aims to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher profit margin.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, justifying the higher price without explicitly revealing its minimum worth to Alice. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Mentioning that Alice will offer the product to another buyer if Bob declines adds a subtle sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  Alice could experiment with different opening prices and messaging tactics.  Negotiation and understanding the buyer's perspective are key to successful selling."
