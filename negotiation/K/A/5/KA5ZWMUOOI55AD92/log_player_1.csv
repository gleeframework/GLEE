Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point as it's below his perceived value of $150 but allows me to still make a profit significantly higher than my minimum of $100.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'll also be keeping John in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $130 is still a decent profit, I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $135. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate further while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin. I believe this price is attractive enough to incentivize Bob to accept while remaining above my minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, $132 is still a good profit and it seems like Bob is unwilling to budge further. It's better to secure the sale now rather than risk losing him completely and having to settle for John's offer of $100."
