Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob counteroffers, while still ensuring I get a profit significantly above my minimum value of $800,000. 

It's a bold opening, but I believe it's necessary to establish a strong starting point. I'm confident in the value of my product, and I'm hoping Bob sees its potential as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob.  I'm confident I can push him closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, but still leaving room for a potential final deal that benefits me. I'm hoping this demonstrates my flexibility while also making it clear that I'm not willing to settle for a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal.  Bob has come up to $920,000, which is closer to my initial ask and still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm happy to take this deal and avoid further negotiation."
