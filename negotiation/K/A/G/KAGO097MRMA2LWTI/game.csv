"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the maximum I can go. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $10000 is closer to where I need to be, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  How about we split the difference and go with $11000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still be getting a great deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $10500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me is $15000. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,4,
