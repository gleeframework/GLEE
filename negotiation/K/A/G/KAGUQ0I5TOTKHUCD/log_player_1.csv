Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since we know Bob values the product at $12,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, we want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting at $18,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also establishes the product's value as potentially higher in his mind.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Mentioning that we'll list the product publicly (without explicitly naming John) creates a subtle sense of urgency and competition.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
