Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product has unique qualities that justify a premium price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique qualities, but I still think $1,300,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We're willing to walk away with $1,000,000 from John, so there's room to push Bob a bit further before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,280,000. This reflects my desire to make a deal, while still acknowledging the true value of this product."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,280,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,220,000, but I need to be closer to my target price. Can we meet at $1,240,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly committed to staying below $1,300,000 and we're approaching a point of diminishing returns. Accepting his offer of $1,240,000 secures a significant profit above our guaranteed sale to John ($1,000,000) and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a worse outcome."
