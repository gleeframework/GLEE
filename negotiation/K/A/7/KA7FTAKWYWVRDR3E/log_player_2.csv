Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,080,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can make it work.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $1,070,000.  At this point, cutting your losses and buying from John for $1,500,000 is the safer bet.  You'll lose out on some potential savings, but you'll avoid the risk of Alice continuing to increase her price or reaching an impasse."
