"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I do see the value in this product, but that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider a lower offer, closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a fair compromise for me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $1,050,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! I can see you're willing to make a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000 just yet. I'm willing to go a bit lower, to $1,075,000. This is still a great price for you, and it's a small step closer to the value you place on the product.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough! I respect that. Let's make this simple: $1,060,000 and we have a deal.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about this deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,070,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. Let's shake on it!",1070000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. My final offer is $1,065,000. Take it or leave it.",1065000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,080,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can make it work.",1080000.0,Alice,9,
