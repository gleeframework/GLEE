Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its quality and features, I'm asking for $10,000.  I believe it's a fair price that reflects its true value."", ""product_price"": 10000}
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's strategic to begin with a price higher than your minimum ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's quality and features helps justify the initial high price in Bob's mind. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** By expressing belief in a ""fair price,"" you signal willingness to negotiate without appearing desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $7,000 is less than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There's still room for negotiation as Bob's offer isn't drastically far off. You can try to meet in the middle. 
* **John as Backup:** You always have the option to sell to John for your minimum price, so there's no need to settle for less than what you're willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is truly reflected in my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $8,500?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** You're acknowledging Bob's offer while standing your ground on the product's value.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  By suggesting $8,500, you're demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.  
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the price above your minimum while still offering Bob a potentially attractive deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $7,800 is only slightly below your minimum of $8,000. 
* **Minimal Gain from Further Negotiation:** It's unlikely that further negotiation will result in a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now secures the sale and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations that might not yield a much better outcome."
