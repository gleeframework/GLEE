Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you at $120, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. I'm offering the product to you for $125. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $125.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $120, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price rather than risk Alice not budging further."
