Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I earn significantly more than my minimum of $80. If Bob rejects, I can then consider his counteroffer or move on to John for the guaranteed $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired price. I'll reject his offer and send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's offer and above my minimum. It shows flexibility while ensuring I don't settle for too low a price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not worth the continued negotiation.  It's better for me to take John's guaranteed offer of $80 than risk further haggling with Bob."
