Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $149. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's really interested, but still ensures you make a significant profit.
* **Slightly Below John's Price:** Offering it just below John's price might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal, even if it's still significantly higher than his perceived value.

**Important Note:** This assumes you don't know Bob's perceived value of $80. In a real negotiation, understanding the other party's needs and wants is crucial."
