Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering a price of $1,300,000 allows for potential negotiation while staying comfortably above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** The message focuses on the product's value to entice Bob, potentially justifying the high price in his mind.

By starting high and emphasizing value, I maximize my chances of securing a deal closer to my desired outcome, knowing I have John as a safety net."
