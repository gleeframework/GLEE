"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product offers substantial value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
