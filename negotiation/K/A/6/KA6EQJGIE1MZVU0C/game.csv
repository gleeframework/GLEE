"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price, given the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $95. Can you consider my revised offer?,95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my price.  Let's settle on $98. It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal. What do you say?",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but no higher. Can you meet me at this price?",92.0,Bob,6,
