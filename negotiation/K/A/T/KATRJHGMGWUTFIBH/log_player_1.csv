Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  You know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Starting with a higher price ($12,000) allows room for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can potentially still settle at a price above your minimum while keeping him interested. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer at $8,000 provides you with a safety net, ensuring you don't have to go below your minimum."
