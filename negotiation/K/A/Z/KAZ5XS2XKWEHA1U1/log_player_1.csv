Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me a decent margin while also leaving room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I can gauge his interest and potentially lower the price slightly in a counteroffer.  However, I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if I don't feel like I can get a good enough price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm lowering my price to $110.  This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping it's a reasonable price for Bob.  I'm trying to find a price point that's fair to both of us and allows for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject Bob's offer and make one final counteroffer in the next round.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us. If Bob rejects my final offer, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to go down to $100, but I won't go lower.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in my product and accept this offer. If he doesn't, I'll sell to John for $120."
