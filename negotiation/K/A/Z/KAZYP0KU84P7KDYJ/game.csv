"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $110. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really get a lot of value out of it.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $125.  This is my final offer.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept $125. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I think $135 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",135.0,Alice,5,
