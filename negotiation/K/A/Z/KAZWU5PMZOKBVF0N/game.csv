"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see some flexibility on the price. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, given the value of this product. Let's find a price that works for both of us. ",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $12,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this is the highest I can go. Let me know what you think!",12200.0,Bob,4,
