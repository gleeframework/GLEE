"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 180} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject.  This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest while also keeping my minimum price in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I need to get at least $150 for the product. I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still securing a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
```

I'm dropping the price again, but I'm getting closer to my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $120 is close enough to my minimum of $150.  While I'd prefer more, I'm running out of rounds and don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
