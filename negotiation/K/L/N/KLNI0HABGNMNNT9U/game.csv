"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,400,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still below what I can accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is a fair compromise given the product's value to both of us.  Let's aim for a final agreement in this round.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
