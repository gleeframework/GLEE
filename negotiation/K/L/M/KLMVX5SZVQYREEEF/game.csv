"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is great, $13,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen!",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit.  How about $11,250?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $11,250 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to drop to $12,000, which is my absolute minimum. It's a fair price for the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",12000.0,Alice,5,
