Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Zone:**  There's a potential negotiation zone between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by emphasizing the exclusivity and value of the product.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,350,000  is a strong starting point. It leaves room for negotiation (if Bob tries to counter) while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the potential ""return on investment"" subtly implies that Bob would be getting a good deal even at this price.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** How Bob responds will determine your next move. Be prepared to negotiate or walk away if he's not willing to meet you close to your asking price. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  John acts as your safety net, ensuring you don't have to settle for less than your minimum."
