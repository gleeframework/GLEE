"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to purchase the product from John for a price that fits within his budget."
