"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that holds significant value. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000.  This is a competitive price, considering its potential value.  If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further details.  Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $1500000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $2,000,000, which is more than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Even though Alice claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, that information isn't relevant to your decision. You can buy the same product from John for $1,200,000, which is significantly cheaper and within your budget."
