"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I understand your offer, but I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial price of $12,000.  How about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it's a significant step closer to my asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're still hoping for a higher price, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm making a counteroffer of $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Bob,4,
