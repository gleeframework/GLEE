Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. I'm confident this would be a wise investment for you."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that aligns with my budget. Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Bob's offer is far too low. It makes more sense to counter in hopes of reaching a more agreeable price.  We're still far from a point where accepting John's offer is necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer reflects the inherent value and potential returns you'll gain from this acquisition."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,900,000 is closer to what I envisioned, it's still a bit beyond my current budget.  Would you consider $900,000?  I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate. We're still far enough away from John's guaranteed offer to justify continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, the value of this product is substantial.  Let's settle this right now - how about $1,600,000?  This is a significant reduction and a very strong offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're halfway through the rounds. Applying pressure with a ""let's settle this"" tone might encourage Bob to move closer to our desired price.
* **Strategic Concession:** A drop to $1,600,000 is a notable concession, signaling to Bob that we're willing to negotiate but still value the product highly.
* **Above John's Offer:**  While we're getting closer to John's offer, we're still aiming for a higher price with Bob. We can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations is still significant. To be candid, anything above $1,000,000 would be difficult for me to justify.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 as a final attempt to reach an agreement. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a crucial point in the negotiation. Bob has significantly increased his offer and presented it as his ""final attempt."" Let's analyze the options:

* **Accepting Bob's Offer ($1,000,000):** While significantly below your initial asking price, it's a substantial profit over Bob's initial offers. It guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of not reaching an agreement.

* **Rejecting and Countering:** You risk alienating Bob, as he stated this is his final attempt. He might walk away, leaving you with John's offer as the only option.

* **Selling to John ($1,500,000):**  This is your safety net. It guarantees the price you deem as the product's minimum worth but cuts off further negotiation with Bob.

**Decision:**

This is a tough one.  While $1,000,000 is a decent profit, Bob's ""final offer"" tactic suggests there might be room for a bit more.  

```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We'll take a calculated risk. Rejecting Bob's offer, knowing we have John's offer as backup, allows us to gauge Bob's seriousness and potentially secure a slightly higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty and your willingness to move closer to a fair price. I understand this is a significant investment for you.  To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is my final offer. It bridges the gap significantly and ensures a win-win scenario for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** By stating this is our final offer, we're conveying seriousness while still negotiating. 
* **Strategic Middle Ground:**  $1,250,000 is a significant compromise,  splitting the difference between his last offer and our previous price. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We're running out of rounds, making this counteroffer more compelling as Bob might not get a better deal. 
* **Backup Plan:** We still have John's offer if Bob rejects this, mitigating our risk."
