"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a truly valuable asset. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,200,000 is fair. I'm confident this would be a wise investment for you.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $700,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, the value of this product is substantial.  Let's settle this right now - how about $1,600,000?  This is a significant reduction and a very strong offer.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations is still significant. To be candid, anything above $1,000,000 would be difficult for me to justify.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 as a final attempt to reach an agreement. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

It's time to cut your losses. Alice has come down in price, but she's unlikely to meet your needs within the remaining rounds. She's dropped $950,000, but is still very far from your price point. You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000, which is significantly better than your current trajectory with Alice."
