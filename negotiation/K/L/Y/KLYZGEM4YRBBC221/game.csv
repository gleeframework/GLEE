"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of a price more around $700,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value you mentioned, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Alice, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offers, so I'll offer $775,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value you mentioned earlier. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,
