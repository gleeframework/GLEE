Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its worth.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  While I don't want to reveal my minimum, I'm hinting at the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed sale with John at $8,000, so I'm not desperate.  This allows me to be firm in negotiations with Bob."
