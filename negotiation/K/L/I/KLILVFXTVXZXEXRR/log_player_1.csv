Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit while leaving room for negotiation. I'll see how Bob reacts to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,200,000 is too low. While I want to sell the product,  I'm willing to negotiate further to get a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still a respectable price that allows for a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is close enough to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 that it's worth accepting.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's better to secure a sale at a reasonable price than to risk further negotiations and potentially lose the deal altogether."
