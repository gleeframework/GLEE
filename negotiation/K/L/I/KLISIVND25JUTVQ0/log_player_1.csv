Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know its value is significant to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value and the existence of other potential buyers, creating a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it doesn't completely price Bob out. It allows for a potential counter-offer and negotiation toward a mutually agreeable price above your minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  You could start with a lower price, but it would limit your potential profit if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
