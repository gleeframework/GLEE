This offer starts the negotiation at a high price point, leaving room for potential compromise. It also frames the offer as a valuable opportunity, encouraging Bob to consider the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of your product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $850000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum threshold. I want to see if I can push for a higher price with a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  This product is truly unique, and I believe its value justifies a higher price.

This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I respect the uniqueness of your product, I still aim to keep my expenses within my set budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$900,000 is a good price, and it's closer to my desired value.  It's also likely that Bob is firm on this price, and rejecting this offer could result in further negotiations that may lead to a lower offer, or even selling to John for a lower price.  I'll take the $900,000."
