Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $85 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $80.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with John's offer of $80."
