Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000, which is the minimum amount I'm willing to accept. This is because I have a guaranteed buyer, John, who is willing to pay that amount. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my profit:** I'm starting with the highest possible price, hoping Bob might be willing to pay it.
* **Minimize risk:**  I have a backup buyer, so I can afford to be firm in my initial offer. 

If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and negotiate from there.  However, I will always have the option to walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While it's tempting to accept the offer and avoid further negotiation, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price. 

I have two strong reasons to reject:

1. **Guaranteed backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000. 
2. **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's initial offer is low, there is still room for negotiation. By rejecting, I can send a counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my minimum.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $900,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer of $1,000,000, but it's still well above Bob's initial offer of $700,000.

My strategy here is to:

* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm open to finding a compromise.
* **Maintain a high price:**  I'm still aiming for a price closer to my desired $1,000,000. 
* **Gauge Bob's interest:** This counteroffer will give me a better idea of Bob's willingness to pay. 

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I will assess his next offer and decide whether to accept, make another counteroffer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price of $1,000,000. 

Here's why I'm rejecting his offer:

* **Significant gap:** There's still a $250,000 gap between his offer and my desired price. 
* **Guaranteed backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:**  I believe there is still room for negotiation. Bob might be willing to increase his offer further.

Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll aim to send a counteroffer that is closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that bridges the gap between my previous offer of $900,000 and Bob's current offer of $750,000.

This counteroffer is designed to:

* **Show flexibility:**  It demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Maintain a high price:**  It's still a substantial price that reflects the value of the product.
* **Encourage a deal:**  This offer could potentially be attractive enough for Bob to accept, allowing me to avoid selling to John at a lower price.

If Bob rejects this offer, I will reassess the situation and decide whether to make another counteroffer, accept his offer, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $780,000 is slightly higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price.  Considering that:

* **The gap is still substantial:** There's still a $220,000 difference between his offer and my desired price.
* **Negotiations are stalled:**  We've been going back and forth for several rounds without significant progress.
* **Guaranteed backup:** I have a guaranteed buyer, John, who is willing to pay $1,000,000.

It's in my best interest to avoid further negotiation and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John."
