"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make me a deal and buy it from me for $150? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay $150 for the product from John, and Alice is offering the same price, there's no incentive to accept her offer.  You might be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but you don't have enough information to know if that's possible.  Rejecting the offer keeps your options open."
