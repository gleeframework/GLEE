"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for a price of $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a great deal considering the alternative buyer I have lined up is willing to pay $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","Alice's offer is ridiculously high.  It's way more than you want to pay and even more than she values it. You have a much better option.
