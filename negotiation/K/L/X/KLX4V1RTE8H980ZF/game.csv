"I've been willing to compromise a lot, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1020000. I think that's the lowest price I can accept for this product. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other offers. I'm still open to selling it to you, but I need a serious offer.",1020000.0,Alice,9,
