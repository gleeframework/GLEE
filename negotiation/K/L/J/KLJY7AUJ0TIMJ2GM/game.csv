"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",10500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price that considers its value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, but also recognizes my minimum acceptable price.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $7,000? That's a significant price difference, but I'm hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
