"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite cover the value I see in this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll reap from owning this product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
