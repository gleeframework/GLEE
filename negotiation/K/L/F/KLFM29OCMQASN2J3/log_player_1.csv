I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start high, especially since I don't know Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to go lower than my initial offer, but not that low.  I will counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $9,000.  This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a profit above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more than $8,000, Bob's counteroffers are becoming too low.  It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk a lower price or further negotiation with Bob."
