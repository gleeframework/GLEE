"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to work with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction.  A $2,000 drop from Alice's initial offer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about purchasing the product, but is also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Bob has time to continue negotiating and potentially get an even better price.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer keeps the pressure on Alice to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing that he's willing to compromise.  This counteroffer is a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's current offer, and could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is only $3,000 above Bob's ideal price. With only 5 rounds left, it's becoming more risky to keep rejecting offers.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product for a good price while still having some negotiating leverage if he decides to try and get a lower price from John later."
