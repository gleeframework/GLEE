"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,
