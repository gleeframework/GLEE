"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to her ($1,000,000). There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $975,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to reach an agreement. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's target price, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. There's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get an even better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $937,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $962,500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the value it brings to you. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $962,500 is very close to Bob's previous offer of $937,500, and it's well below the price Bob would pay from John ($1,200,000).  At this point, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product at a good price. Further negotiation may be possible, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to pay John's higher price is not worth the potential savings."
