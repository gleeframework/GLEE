Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me to accept at this time.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll lower my price to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.
