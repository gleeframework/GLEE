Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to make the most money possible. Since I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, I need to offer Bob a price that's enticing but still significantly profitable for me.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $800,000.  Offering it for slightly above this won't be tempting enough. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer,"" I'm creating a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a higher price point and the risk of losing him as a buyer, ultimately ensuring a substantial profit for me."
