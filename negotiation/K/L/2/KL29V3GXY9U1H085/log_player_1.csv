Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** There is a significant difference between my offer and Bob's value, making a counteroffer from him likely.
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** I'm taking a calculated risk by not starting at $1,500,000. This is to potentially maximize profit if Bob is willing to pay more. However, I also have the safety net of John's offer if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts: I've successfully negotiated a deal above his perceived value.
* If Bob rejects: I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide if I want to counter him again, or if I'm better off accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  There's a chance he might be willing to increase his offer.
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I'm not in a desperate situation. I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer of $1,300,000. This will hopefully strike a balance between getting a higher price and keeping Bob at the negotiation table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer represents a compromise from my initial offer of $1,300,000. 
* **Keeping Bob Engaged:**  I believe this price point is still attractive enough to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation. 
* **Moving Closer to My Target:** I'm moving closer to my target price but leaving some room for further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob Accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a higher price than his initial counteroffer.
* **If Bob Rejects:** I will analyze his counteroffer and decide if I want to counter him again or if I'm better off taking John's offer. I'll also need to consider how many more rounds of negotiation I'm willing to go through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:** There's limited room for further negotiation. Bob is not showing much willingness to increase his offer.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price and avoids further time-consuming negotiation with Bob.

**Conclusion:**

Given the current situation, it's more prudent to accept John's offer and secure a guaranteed price for the product.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob is likely to be unproductive and time-consuming."
