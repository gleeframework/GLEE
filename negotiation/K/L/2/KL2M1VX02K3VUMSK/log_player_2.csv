Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

Round 5
