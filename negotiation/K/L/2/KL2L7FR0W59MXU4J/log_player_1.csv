Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price.  I know it's worth $120 to me, so I'm going to see if Bob is willing to pay that.  If he isn't, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my goal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $115. This is a compromise between my minimum acceptable price and Bob's offer.  Hopefully, it's a sweet spot that will entice him to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  While Bob's offer of $108 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there. I'd rather take the guaranteed $120 from John than risk further negotiation with Bob.  There's no guarantee that we'll reach a deal, and I'm confident that John will be happy to buy the product from me."
