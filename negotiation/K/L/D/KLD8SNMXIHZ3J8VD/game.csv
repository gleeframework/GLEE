"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $65 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle!",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, I have a strict budget, and $95 is still pushing it.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $75 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product, and I'm confident you won't regret it! Let's make this happen.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I can do $80, and I think that's a fair compromise. It's the most I can offer, but I'm ready to make the purchase today if you're happy with this.",80.0,Bob,6,
