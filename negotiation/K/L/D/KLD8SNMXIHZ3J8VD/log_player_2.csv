Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, I have a strict budget, and $95 is still pushing it.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",

}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason:I am increasing my offer but staying below my maximum budget.  This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm boundary."")

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $75 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of this product, and I'm confident you won't regret it! Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I can do $80, and I think that's a fair compromise. It's the most I can offer, but I'm ready to make the purchase today if you're happy with this."",

}
``` 

```tool_code
print(""Reason: I'm matching John's price. This is my final offer. It signals to Alice I'm serious and also sets a firm limit without risking the deal by going lower."")
