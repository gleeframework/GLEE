"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about $700,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $700,000 is simply too far below the product's true worth. To reflect its value and still be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000. This price offers a significant advantage to you while still ensuring a worthwhile return for me.  I'm open to discussing further adjustments but need to stay within a realistic range.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $850,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something a little more manageable.  Would you consider $750,000?  I'm serious about this product and believe this offer represents a good compromise for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but  $750,000 just isn't a number that works for me. However, I value your interest and am willing to make a final concession.  How about $825,000?  This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and is still fair considering the product's value to you. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This is a big decision for me, and I want to make sure we get it right. I'm prepared to offer $780,000.  This is a strong offer, and I'm hoping you'll see it as a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",780000.0,Bob,6,
