Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $700,000 is simply too far below the product's true worth. To reflect its value and still be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000. This price offers a significant advantage to you while still ensuring a worthwhile return for me.  I'm open to discussing further adjustments but need to stay within a realistic range.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a lower price, but  $750,000 just isn't a number that works for me. However, I value your interest and am willing to make a final concession.  How about $825,000?  This represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and is still fair considering the product's value to you. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.
