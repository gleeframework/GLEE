"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth at least that much to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, so how about we settle around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. Let's try $1,100,000. This still gives you a good value, and allows me to get closer to what I need.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,100,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm willing to budge a little more. How about $1,025,000? That's me really stretching my budget, but I do see the value in your product.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
