"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth at least that much to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a fair price, so how about we settle around $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $800,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. Let's try $1,100,000. This still gives you a good value, and allows me to get closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,100,000 is still a little high for my budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm still aiming to get closer to my $1,000,000 goal.  While $950,000 is tempting, it's still below what I consider a fair price for the product.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on this.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm willing to budge a little more. How about $1,025,000? That's me really stretching my budget, but I do see the value in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** While it's not the ideal price, $1,025,000 is very close to my minimum threshold of $1,000,000.  Since I only have 4 rounds left, it's risky to keep negotiating and risk Bob backing out completely or me having to sell to John for the lower price.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale close to my target price."
