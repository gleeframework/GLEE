"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  How about $11,500?  This is still a great price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a little bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
