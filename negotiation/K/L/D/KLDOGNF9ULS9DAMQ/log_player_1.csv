Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000 if I don't reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  While it's tempting to take $11,000, I believe I can get closer to my target price by rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a price that reflects the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident that John will buy the product for $12,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  Therefore, I'll choose to sell to John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
