{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what you're willing to pay from John.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better price from Alice through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is to gauge her willingness to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground. It's also important to remember that I have a fallback option with John, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in my initial counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my preferred price range, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not ready to accept yet as I might be able to get a better deal with further counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. However, I'm still keeping it below Alice's current offer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price range.  While I'd prefer to get it lower, I'm now at a point where it's getting close to the price I'd be willing to pay from John. It's better to secure the product at a reasonable price than risk losing the deal altogether."
