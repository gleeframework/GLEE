"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. This is a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still advantageous. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is closer to your proposal and still a fair value for the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still above Bob's ideal price but significantly closer to his budget.  It's worth accepting this offer as it's unlikely Bob will be able to negotiate a lower price, and it's better than buying from John at $1,200,000."
