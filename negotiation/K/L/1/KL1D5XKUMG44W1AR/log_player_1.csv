Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a fair price:** It's above Bob's valuation of $12,000, giving him a good incentive to buy.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's below your minimum of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation process, potentially leading to a win-win situation for both of you.

Remember, I can always sell to John for $15,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
