"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $12,500?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  $12,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,
