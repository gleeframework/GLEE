"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($110 < $120).**
* **Buying from Alice saves you $10 compared to buying from John.** 

Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice further, accepting her offer is the best option to maximize your savings in this scenario."
