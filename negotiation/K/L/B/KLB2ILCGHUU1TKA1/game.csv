"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand you're not willing to go as low as $90, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we try $95? It's still a bit lower than your original price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but $95 is still too low for me.  How about $100?  That's my minimum, and it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,5,
