Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the highest I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $1,300,000?

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $1,150,000? I'm trying to find a sweet spot where both of us can be happy with the deal.

While I'd like to keep negotiating with Bob, the offers are getting too low for me.  I'm going to take John's offer of $1,500,000. It's the best option for me at this point."
