{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,200,000, but I can compromise a bit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. What do you think?
