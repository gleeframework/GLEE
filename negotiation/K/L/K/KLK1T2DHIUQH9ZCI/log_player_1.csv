Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $150, making it an attractive offer to Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:**  This price leaves room for negotiation, allowing me to potentially reach a price that's closer to my minimum value if Bob counteroffers.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Having John as an alternative buyer at $150 ensures I won't settle for a price lower than my minimum. If negotiations with Bob stall or fail, I can easily switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While his offer is low, it shows he's interested. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more acceptable price.
* **John's Offer Provides Leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150 gives me leverage in the negotiation. I can use this knowledge to push for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his offer of $100 and my previous offer of $120. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still stand my ground.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  $110 is still above my minimum value of $150, so I'm not giving away too much.
* **Focus on Fair Deal:**  Framing it as a ""fair price for both of us"" appeals to Bob's sense of reason and fairness."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $105. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While Bob is inching closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer keeps the conversation open and allows me to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Leverage of John's Offer:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $150, I'm not under pressure to settle for a price I'm uncomfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're really keen on getting this product, and I appreciate that. While $105 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. Let's try $110 one last time. It's a fair price, and it'll allow us to finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:**  This is my final counteroffer. It's important to reiterate my willingness to compromise, but also to show that I'm sticking to my price point.
* **Appeal to Finality:**  I'm emphasizing that $110 is a ""fair price"" and that it will allow us to ""finalize"" the deal. This adds pressure on Bob to accept.
* **John's Offer as Backstop:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm ready to walk away and sell to John. This knowledge gives me the confidence to stand firm."
