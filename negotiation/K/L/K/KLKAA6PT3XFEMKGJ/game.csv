"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12000?  I'm very interested in your product, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $13500 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $13000?  I'm really serious about buying your product, and this would be a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
