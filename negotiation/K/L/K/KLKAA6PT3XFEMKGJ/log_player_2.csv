"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's initial offer is at Bob's maximum price point, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $15,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?  I'm very interested in your product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13500?  I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still some wiggle room. Bob can likely get the price down further. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can continue the negotiation and attempt to secure a lower price."

How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  I'm really serious about buying your product, and this would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
