"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, the product's value significantly exceeds $1,100,000.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to let it go for $1,300,000. This feels like a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
