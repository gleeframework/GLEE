Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows Bob that you're serious about selling the product, but you're not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is close to your minimum and still leaves you with a decent profit. It's likely he won't go any lower, so accepting his offer is the best option."
