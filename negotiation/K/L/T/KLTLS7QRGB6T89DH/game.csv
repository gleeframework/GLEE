"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're presenting, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product. Please let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 700000 is a bit lower than my initial ask, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of 820000. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product valuable.",820000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $820000 is still a bit higher than my target. I'm willing to go up to $750000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not ready to accept 750000. I'm willing to consider a price of 790000. It's a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings.",790000.0,Alice,5,
