"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product and the potential it holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $1,200,000 is still a bit of a stretch. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000. I believe that's a fair price that recognizes the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
