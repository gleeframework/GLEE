"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation theory suggests starting with a strong opening offer. While $2,000,000 is significantly above Bob's perceived value, it provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Confidence and Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value without being overly aggressive. The aim is to frame the negotiation from a position of strength and optimism. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor the negotiation:** Your initial high price sets a psychological anchor, potentially influencing Bob to make a higher counteroffer than if you started lower.
2. **Gather information:** Bob's reaction to this offer will give you insight into his willingness to pay and his negotiation style. 
 
You are prepared to negotiate down, but only to a certain point, as you always have John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches John's standing offer.  While there might be a slight chance of negotiating a higher price with Bob, it's risky.  Here's why:

* **Time Value:** Each round represents time and potential opportunity cost.  You have a guaranteed offer in hand.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob clearly stated his perceived value is $1,000,000. His offer of $1,500,000 is already a significant stretch. It's unlikely he'll go much higher.

Selling to John immediately secures the best possible outcome with minimal risk."
