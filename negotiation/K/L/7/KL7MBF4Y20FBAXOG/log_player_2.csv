``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,500 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both parties to find a price they're happy with."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $12,500.  I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay $12,500, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is still a better price than John's offer, Bob can still potentially save more money by continuing to negotiate with Alice. Alice has already moved closer to Bob's initial offer, indicating a willingness to compromise. There's still room to find a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still feeling a bit high at $14,000.  How about we split the difference and meet at $13,250? This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
