Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Negotiation often benefits from a strong opening position. By starting well above both your minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000), you leave room for negotiation while gauging his interest.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" provides a reason for the high price without revealing your own minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation process. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:** If Bob accepts, you've secured a great deal.
2. **Understand Bob's Position:** His response will reveal how interested he is and how much he values the product. 
3. **Leave Room to Negotiate:**  You can always come down in price, especially knowing John is a guaranteed backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is above his perceived value, indicating he's willing to negotiate and likely sees additional value. However, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. By rejecting and countering, you can test his flexibility further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While that price doesn't work for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects the true value of this unique product."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You've made a significant drop from your initial price, showing flexibility and willingness to make a deal. 
* **Holding Firm (for now):** You're still comfortably above both Bob's offer and your minimum, leaving space for further negotiation.
* **Reiterating Value:**  By mentioning ""true value"" you're subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth and justifying your price.

This approach aims to:

* **Encourage Bob:** The significant price drop might incentivize him to make a more aggressive counteroffer.
* **Maintain Control:**  You're dictating the pace of the negotiation and avoiding appearing desperate.
* **Option for John Remains:**  Remember, you always have John as a reliable fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Exceeds Minimum:** Bob's offer is now above your $1,000,000 minimum, securing a profit.
* **Strong Position:**  He's moved significantly from his initial offer, demonstrating strong interest. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing negotiations risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting now guarantees the sale.

While you could potentially squeeze out a bit more, the risk of Bob walking away and the guaranteed $1,050,000 make accepting the most logical choice."
