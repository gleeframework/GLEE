Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $13,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about it. How about we try $14,250? I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still open to negotiations.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're firm on $13,000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the best deal for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13,750?

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I still think this product would be a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within budget:** $13,250 is within your maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Limited time:** You only have one round left and rejecting this offer could lead to having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Good deal:** This is a good deal for you considering the product is worth $12,000 to Alice.  You are getting it for $1,250 more than her minimum price, which is reasonable. 

While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price with Alice. This offer provides a good outcome for you."
