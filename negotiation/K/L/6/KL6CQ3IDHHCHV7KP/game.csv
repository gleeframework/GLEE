"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $12,500 right now. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're a savvy negotiator, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $14,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $13,000.  This would give us both a fair deal. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, $13,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about it. How about we try $14,250? I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still open to negotiations.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to come down, and I appreciate that. However, $14,250 is still a bit outside my range. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $13,000. It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's work together to close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $13,000, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the best deal for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $13,750? It's a bit more than your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",13750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  However, $13,750 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $13,000. It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's try to close this deal before we run out of time.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I still think this product would be a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm willing to meet you at $13,250, but that's as low as I can go. If you're still interested, let's make a deal!",13250.0,Alice,9,
