Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a great price of $200. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down while still staying above your desired profit margin.
* **Gauge Interest:** This initial high price will help you understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer. This gives you leverage in negotiations, as you don't *need* to sell to Bob at a loss."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think the product is a great item, but I'm on a tight budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate, and John provides a safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $170? It's a steal for the value you're getting!"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Shows Willingness:**  By countering, you signal that you're willing to negotiate and find a price that works for both of you.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  Instead of simply rejecting Bob's offer, you're offering a price that's a significant decrease from your initial offer, but still well above your minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's value can help justify the higher price and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $120 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $140? I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:** Bob's offer of $140 is now above your minimum acceptable price and provides a reasonable profit. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether. Bob might walk away, or you might end up with a final price only slightly better than $140.
* **Bird in Hand:** It's often better to secure a good deal now than to risk it for a potentially slightly better deal later."
