"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  What do you think?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I can make a reasonable profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $15,500? This is my final offer, and it's the most I can afford.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I understand that you've made a serious effort to find a price that works for you. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $17,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $16,750. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",16750.0,Alice,5,
