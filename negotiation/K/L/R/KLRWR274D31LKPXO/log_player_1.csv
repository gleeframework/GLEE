"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Fairness:** While the price is high, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and open tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would be a huge loss.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** While Bob's offer is low, he's expressed a willingness to pay a premium. This indicates room for negotiation.
* **Time to Counter:** I have 8 rounds left, giving me ample time to counter Bob's offer and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work. This still leaves some room for us both to get a good outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer is halfway between Bob's offer and my initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain a Fair Margin:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I'm not selling myself short.
* **Emphasis on Finding Common Ground:**  I'm using language to emphasize that I'm open to continuing the negotiation and finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my ideal outcome.
* **Negotiation Continues:** There is still room for further negotiation, as Bob has shown a willingness to compromise and raise his offer. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I'm confident that with further negotiation, I can potentially secure a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Time is on My Side:** I have 6 rounds remaining, giving me ample time to continue the negotiation and explore options."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about making this deal work. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,075,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but it shows my commitment to finding a solution that benefits us both.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Compromise:** I'm demonstrating a willingness to compromise further, showing that I'm taking Bob's offer seriously.
* **Strategic Price:** $1,075,000 is a middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, signaling a clear desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Reiterating Commitment:** I emphasize my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us to keep the negotiation positive and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit further and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Negotiation Room:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired range, there's still room for further negotiation.  His increasing offers indicate that he's willing to go higher.
* **Time Advantage:**  I have 4 rounds left, which is enough time to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Risk of Selling to John:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a safe option, but I want to see if I can secure a better deal with Bob.  There's a chance that with continued negotiation, I can get a price closer to my ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $1,025,000 simply won't work for me. To bridge the gap, I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,050,000.  This reflects a further concession on my part and brings us much closer to a deal.  Let's finalize this agreement!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:**  I'm raising Bob's offer by $25,000, demonstrating a continued willingness to compromise, while keeping the price within a range that is still profitable for me.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language like ""bridge the gap"" and ""finalize this agreement"" to emphasize my desire to reach a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Limited Time:** I only have three rounds left, so I need to get closer to a final agreement. However, I'm not rushing and am still willing to negotiate. 
* **Weighing Options:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, I believe there's still a chance to get a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,025,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can work with me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  We are down to the last two rounds of negotiation.
* **Stalemate:**  Bob has repeatedly offered $1,025,000, which is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of Losing Value:** Further negotiation may not result in a significantly better offer from Bob, and I risk losing more time and potentially ending up with a worse deal.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a substantial profit and allows me to avoid the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob.

While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, the time constraint and the likelihood of a better offer from John make selling to John the most sensible option at this point."
