Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potential to go higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not satisfied with getting the bare minimum. I believe there's still room for a higher offer. I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm countering with $13,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still securing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to earn more, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum and saves time."
