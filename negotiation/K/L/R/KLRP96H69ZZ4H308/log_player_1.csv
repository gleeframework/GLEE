Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $9,500 is more than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You've left some space for Bob to counteroffer without you feeling pressured to accept a lower price.
* **It's a fair price for Bob:**  Since the product is worth $10,000 to him, he's still getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making a counteroffer, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. That's a fair price considering the value of the product for you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I have a budget in mind. How about we settle in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same amount. Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
