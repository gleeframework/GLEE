Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}

I'm starting with my target price, as I know John is willing to pay that. This will give Bob a clear understanding of my expectations and the potential for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I will make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,100,000, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his range. This shows willingness to negotiate while still keeping a reasonable margin for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum price of $1,200,000. I'll sell to John to ensure I get my target value."
