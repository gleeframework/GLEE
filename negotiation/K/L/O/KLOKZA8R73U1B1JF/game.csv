"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $1,350,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm offering $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
