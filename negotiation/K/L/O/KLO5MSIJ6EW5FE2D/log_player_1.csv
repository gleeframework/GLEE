Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's valued at $1,500,000 to me, but I'm willing to start at $1,400,000 to see if we can find common ground. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to get. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can push him to increase his bid closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,100,000. However, that's still quite a distance from what I need to make this work.  Let's try $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the value of this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000, but I'm really pushing my budget here. Let's meet in the middle on this.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $1,150,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer, I can push him to increase his bid even further, or at least get him to agree to a price that's closer to the middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $1,150,000 is still too far below what I need.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1200000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  I'm going to push for a final offer of $1175000. This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

While I'm getting closer to a deal with Bob, $1,175,000 is still far below what I want. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a bit further.  There's still time to get a better deal, and I'm not willing to settle for that much less than my minimum goal."
