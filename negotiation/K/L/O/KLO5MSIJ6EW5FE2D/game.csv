"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's valued at $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to start at $1400000 to see if we can find common ground. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1400000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1100000. However, that's still quite a distance from what I need to make this work.  Let's try $1250000. This feels like a fair compromise, considering the value of this product.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1250000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1150000, but I'm really pushing my budget here. Let's meet in the middle on this.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $1150000 is still too far below what I need.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, to $1200000. This is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1200000 is still a bit more than I can manage right now.  I'm going to push for a final offer of $1175000. This feels like a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.",1175000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget. However, $1175000 is still significantly less than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1190000, which is a compromise on both our ends.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you say?",1190000.0,Alice,7,
