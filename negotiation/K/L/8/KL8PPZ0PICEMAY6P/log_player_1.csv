Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $900000. Would you consider accepting a counteroffer of $750000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
