"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe a price of $900000 would be fair for both of us.  What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $900000. Would you consider accepting a counteroffer of $750000?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm open to negotiation, $750000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  To be fair to both of us, how about we meet in the middle at $825000? This would still provide you with a valuable product at a price that's within your budget.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I think $825000 is still slightly out of my budget. Could we possibly meet closer to my maximum price of $800000? I'm hoping for something around $800000 if possible.",800000.0,Bob,4,
