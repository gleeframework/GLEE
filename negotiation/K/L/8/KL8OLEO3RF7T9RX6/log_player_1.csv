"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a price I find acceptable, it's unlikely he'll reach $12,000.  I have a guaranteed offer from John at my minimum acceptable price, so it makes the most sense to take that offer now."
