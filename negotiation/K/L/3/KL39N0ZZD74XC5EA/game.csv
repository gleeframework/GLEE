"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $925,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. Let's meet halfway again. I'm willing to pay $887,500. I think this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",887500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $887,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $915,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me.",915000.0,Alice,5,
