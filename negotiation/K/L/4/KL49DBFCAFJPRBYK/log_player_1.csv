Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $119 allows a small buffer if Bob tries to negotiate a slightly lower price. 
* **Secure a Sale:**  While $120 is ideal, there's a risk Bob might find it too high and reject the offer entirely. $119 still secures a significant profit compared to selling to John."
