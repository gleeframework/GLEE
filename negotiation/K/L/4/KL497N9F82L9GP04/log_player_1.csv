"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's value is significantly higher than your initial offer.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still willing to hold out for a higher price from Bob. Accepting his offer now would mean leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to continue this negotiation. I've given your latest offer serious thought. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to accept $850,000 for the product. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 850000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer creates a firm stance while still offering a potential compromise that's significantly above my minimum and John's offer. It signals to Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal but not willing to go below a certain threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is now very close to my final offer and significantly above John's standing offer. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for $800,000 is too great at this point. Accepting $825,000 secures a strong profit."
