Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000. 
* I'm taking a calculated risk:
    * **If Bob accepts:** I make a profit of $500,000.
    * **If Bob rejects:** I still get $1,000,000 from John. 
* This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while ensuring I get at least my minimum desired value for the product."
