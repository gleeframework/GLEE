Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to maximize her profit. Since John acts as a guaranteed backup buyer at $1,500,000, Alice aims to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a high price of $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price without revealing Alice's true minimum.
* **Open for Negotiation:**  By asking for Bob's thoughts, Alice keeps the conversation open, allowing Bob to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer, ensuring Alice gets the best possible outcome."
