"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $110 for the product. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $115. Let me know if that works for you.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about we meet at $125? I think that's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
