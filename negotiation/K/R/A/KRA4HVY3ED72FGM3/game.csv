"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1200000, considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to ensure it's within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $1050000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to an agreement on this price. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go below $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $1025000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
