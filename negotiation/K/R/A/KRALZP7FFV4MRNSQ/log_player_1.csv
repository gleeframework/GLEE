"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $1,100,000, Alice signals flexibility and willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Confident but Not Aggressive:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value while expressing openness to discussion. This avoids appearing overly aggressive. 

Alice's strategy is to start high and slowly concede, aiming for a price significantly above her minimum ($800,000) while staying below Bob's perceived value.  She will gauge Bob's reactions and adjust her approach in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant profit, Alice knows Bob values the product at $1,200,000. She's willing to negotiate but not to settle for less than $1,000,000. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing her to counter with a price closer to her target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've given your offer careful consideration.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000.  This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your perspective.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice is making a smaller concession ($50,000) than Bob's previous reduction ($150,000). This signals her value while still moving toward a potential agreement.
* **Targeting the Middle Ground:**  By splitting the difference between their last offers, Alice aims for a compromise that could be appealing to Bob while staying above her $1,000,000 target.
* **Continuing Open Communication:**  Alice's message maintains a collaborative tone, emphasizing her effort to find a mutually beneficial solution. This encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. To find that middle ground, I'd like to offer $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met Alice's minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While she could potentially push for a slightly higher amount, there's also the risk that Bob could walk away or significantly reduce his offer in subsequent rounds.  

Accepting the $1,000,000 offer secures a substantial profit for Alice and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
