"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's above the product's value to you ($1,200,000) and leaves no room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potential for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Considering the product's value to me, I'd like to offer $950,000.  This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:** $950,000 is a good starting point that's still above Alice's minimum value ($800,000) and below your maximum value ($1,200,000).
* **Clear Communication:** The message explains the rationale for the offer, focusing on a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've given your offer careful consideration.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000.  This reflects the product's significant value while acknowledging your perspective.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget.  Continuing to negotiate will likely result in a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still above my budget. To find that middle ground, I'd like to offer $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Progressing Towards a Deal:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to meet Alice halfway.
* **Fair Compromise:**  $1,000,000 is a good compromise, still significantly less than Alice's first offer but still above her minimum value.
* **Staying Within Budget:** This price stays within Bob's maximum budget and leaves some room for further negotiation if needed."
