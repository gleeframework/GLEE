"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As the current owner, I'm looking for a price of $1,100,000. This is a competitive offer, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
