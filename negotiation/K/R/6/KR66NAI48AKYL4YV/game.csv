"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this unique item. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1,200,000 is significantly more than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my own valuation and your need to sell.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth to you, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This price is fair given the value I place on the product and your need to sell. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers, which is $987,500. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
