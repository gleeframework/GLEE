I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than what the product is worth to me, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident that Bob will be interested in buying the product, as it's worth $1,500,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it still allows me to make a profit. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,525,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,525,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, and it's more than what I'd get from John. I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
