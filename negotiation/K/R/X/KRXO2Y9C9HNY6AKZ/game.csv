"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a significant amount to me, so I'm asking for $1500000. I believe it holds immense value for the right buyer, and I think you'd be that buyer. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Can you consider that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $800000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1100000. This is a fair price considering its potential, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $1100000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point.  $900000 is still quite a bit below what I value this product at, but I'm willing to be flexible. Let's try $1000000.  This is a final compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I think I can do a bit better than $1000000. How about $950000?",950000.0,Bob,6,
