Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it to you for $120.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is a little higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counteroffers.  If he rejects, I can always fall back on John's offer of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $100.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is still a great deal for a product worth $100 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105} 
``` 
I'm going to counter with a price of $105.  This is still above my minimum price and gives Bob some room to negotiate, but also shows that I'm willing to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $100.  While I'm tempted to keep negotiating, I don't want to risk losing John's offer of $100.  I'm going to sell the product to John."
