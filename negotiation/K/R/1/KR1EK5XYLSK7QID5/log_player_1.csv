Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $18,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start high. Aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Firmness:**  The ""take-it-or-leave-it"" approach can be effective. It signals that you believe in the value of your product and are not desperate to haggle. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** You get a great deal at $18,000.
* **Bob negotiates:** You have room to lower the price and still make a profit above your minimum.
* **Bob rejects:** You sell to John for your guaranteed $12,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no urgent need to sell quickly. If you need the money immediately, offering a price closer to $12,000 might be a safer approach."
