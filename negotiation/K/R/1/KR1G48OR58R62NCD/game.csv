"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's very fair.  Let's talk about a price of $1,250,000.  This gives you a significant saving and allows me to achieve a good price for the product.  Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,
