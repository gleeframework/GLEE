{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer allows for a significant profit for me while still being potentially attractive to Bob, as he still stands to gain $200,000. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price yet. I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $880,000? That's a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $880,000 is a good compromise. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than what John would pay and still leaves me with a comfortable profit. Further negotiation may yield a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob walking away or needing to sell to John for a lower price isn't worth it."
