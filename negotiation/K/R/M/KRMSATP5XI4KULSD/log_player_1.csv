Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting with a price closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's value.
* **Justification for the price:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" subtly implies the product is worth more than Bob's perceived value.
* **Sense of urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially minimizes bargaining.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize profit:**  If Bob accepts the initial offer, you achieve a significantly higher price than his perceived value.
2. **Secure a deal quickly:** The urgency might push Bob to accept without protracted negotiations.
3. **Maintain the fallback option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can still sell to John at your desired price."
