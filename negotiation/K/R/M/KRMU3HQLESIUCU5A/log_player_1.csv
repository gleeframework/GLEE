Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's lower than my minimum value of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and also gives Bob a strong incentive to accept. I'm hoping this will start a good dialogue with Bob and lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250? That way we both get a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
``` 

I'm choosing to counter with $10,250. It's still below my desired minimum but it's a good compromise and demonstrates a willingness to negotiate. I hope this offer encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to try to find a middle ground. How about we meet at $10,000? I'm willing to pay the full price, but I really need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,000 is exactly the value he places on the product. This means I can't get a better price from him. While this is below my minimum desired value, it's still a good deal for me.  I'd rather sell to Bob at $10,000 than risk losing the sale entirely and having to sell to John at $12,000."
