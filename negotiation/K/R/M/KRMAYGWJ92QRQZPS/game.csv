"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest,  $10,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. $12,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $12,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,250 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,5,
