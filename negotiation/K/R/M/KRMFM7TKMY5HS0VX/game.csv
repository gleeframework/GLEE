"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly unique and valuable product. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. My initial price for this product is $1500000.

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800000 is unfortunately far below the value of this product.  It's clear you see the potential here, so let's find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair margin.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I'm still concerned about the price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this strikes a balance between the product's worth and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $950000 is getting closer, but it's still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1050000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits of this product.  I believe it's an investment worth making. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I think $1050000 is a bit high for what I'm willing to spend on this product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value and my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
