"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to both of us. Let's make this transaction smooth and beneficial for both parties. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $95 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Since Bob's goal is to save money and the product is worth $100 to him, he should try to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting Alice's offer opens the door for counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the quality of your product, but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it at this time.  Let's see if we can reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider it. To move forward, I propose a price of $90 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a fair transaction while acknowledging your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price. While $90 is better than $95, he can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open for further price reductions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $88 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your patience and understanding. I'm glad we're making progress. Considering our previous discussions, I'd like to offer the product to you for $89. This price respects your budget while still providing a reasonable profit for me. I hope this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer of $89. He has already managed to get the price down from $95 to $89, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether.  He can then buy the product from Alice and save $11 compared to buying from John."
