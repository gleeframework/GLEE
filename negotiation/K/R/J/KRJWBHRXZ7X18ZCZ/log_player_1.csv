"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit greater than my minimum desired value of $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum desired value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $130. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for $110. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $125.  This is my last attempt to get a higher price from Bob before I consider selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are very close to my minimum, but I don't want to risk going lower.  I've tried to negotiate with Bob, but I'm not confident I can get him to go any higher. I'm going to sell the product to John for $120 to ensure a guaranteed profit."
