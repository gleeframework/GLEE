"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering your worth and my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $10,500, which is a good middle ground for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $10,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $11,250. It's the best I can do, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
