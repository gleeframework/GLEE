"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price to give myself room for negotiation. My goal is to pay as little as possible, ideally closer to John's $1,000,000 price.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I understand this initial offer might be too low for Alice. However, it opens up the negotiation and allows us to hopefully meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind. If Alice isn't willing to come down to a price I find acceptable, I can always purchase the product from him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I can come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the potential returns you'll see from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down a bit.  While I believe the product has potential, $1,800,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. How about $1,200,000?"", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** I increased my offer by $400,000, showing Alice I'm serious about negotiating and willing to move closer to her price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counter-offer puts us in a range where further negotiation is likely. It also keeps me well below my maximum budget while exceeding the price John is offering. 
* **Testing Alice's Flexibility:** I want to see how much Alice is willing to budge. Her response will give me a better idea of her bottom line."
