Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price than $10,000.  While Bob's offer is tempting, I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This is a fair price that still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. Can we discuss this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good deal. While it's not the highest I hoped for, it's closer to my minimum of $10,000 and secures a sale."
