"Alice, your product is attractive, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My revised offer is $1,080,000. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,080,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'll offer $1,065,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1065000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,065,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. My revised offer is $1,090,000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,090,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. Let's work together to close this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go below $1,100,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. My revised offer is $1,095,000. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1095000.0,Alice,7,
