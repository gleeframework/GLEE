"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer! I think the product is worth a good price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to consider that?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  What do you say?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $115? I'm willing to make a serious offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're keen on getting this product.  Let's split the difference. How about $120?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good deal for you.",120.0,Alice,5,
