"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset with significant potential.  My initial offer is $1200000.  This price reflects its worth while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You can do much better, especially since you have a fallback option of buying from John for $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This price is fair considering its value and provides a healthy profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit low. Considering the product's value and my potential earnings, I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You want to get closer to your target of $900,000.  Rejecting the offer gives you another opportunity to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  Remember, you have a fallback option of buying from John, so there's no pressure to settle for a price you're not comfortable with."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
