"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $9,000.  Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand your position, but $9,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line.  Would you be willing to meet at $10,500? This is my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
