Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think it's a great value for $120.,120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair compromise.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference at $110? I'm really interested in this product and think this price is reasonable.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I think $112 is the lowest I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",112.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $112 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we settle at $111?  That's just a dollar more than my last offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $111 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $3. I'm willing to meet you at $113, which is still a great deal for both of us. It's the best I can do, and I think you'll really love the product.",113.0,Alice,7,
