Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening move. It's unlikely Bob will accept this right away, but it gives me a good starting point for negotiation and sets a high bar for what the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $900,000, hoping to meet Bob halfway. This shows flexibility while still keeping the price above my floor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my floor price, but I'm not willing to risk further negotiation.  John is offering the same amount, so I'll sell to him now and avoid any potential for a lower offer from Bob in the future."
