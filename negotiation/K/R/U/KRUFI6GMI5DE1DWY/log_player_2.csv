Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $12000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12500.  It's still a great price for a product worth so much, and it gives us both a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
