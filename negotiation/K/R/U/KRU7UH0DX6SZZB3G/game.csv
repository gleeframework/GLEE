"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your willingness to move on the price, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,900,000. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but $1,700,000 is a significant drop from my last offer.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe you would greatly benefit from this product.  I'm willing to make one more move and consider $1,800,000.  This is my final offer.",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to meet you at $1,800,000. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
