"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,150,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations slightly above your desired selling point. This allows room for negotiation and makes you appear serious about the product's value.
* **Targeting Mutual Benefit:**  The offered price of $1,150,000 allows Bob to gain $50,000 in perceived value while still netting you a significant profit. This aims for a win-win situation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer isn't aggressively high, signaling that you are open to negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is significantly below his known valuation of the product. While it matches your minimum acceptable price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer keeps the door open for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We're moving closer to Bob's offer to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate, but not drastically. 
* **Maintain Value:** The counteroffer is still well above your minimum and keeps the price within a range where you make a substantial profit.
* **Justification:**  The message reinforces the product's value while acknowledging Bob's position. This keeps the tone positive and solution-oriented."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, but I'm still a bit above $1,000,000. I'd be willing to go up to $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are making progress! Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, indicating he's motivated to buy.  However, there's still potential for a better deal. We are not far from our minimum and have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $1,075,000?"",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This counteroffer directly splits the difference between Bob's last offer ($1,050,000) and our previous asking price ($1,100,000). This is often seen as a fair and reasonable way to move towards an agreement.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By proposing a price that implies a quick resolution, we might encourage Bob to accept rather than risk further back-and-forth.
* **Maintaining Profit:** Even at this price, we are still securing a $75,000 profit above our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit below $1,075,000. I'd be willing to go up to $1,060,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is increasing his offers in smaller increments, suggesting we're approaching his upper limit.  Continuing to negotiate aggressively might backfire.
* **Strong Profit:** $1,060,000 is a very good offer, exceeding our minimum by $60,000.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now brings the money in sooner, which always has some value itself. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** The longer the negotiation continues, the higher the risk that something could disrupt the deal (e.g., Bob finding an alternative)."
