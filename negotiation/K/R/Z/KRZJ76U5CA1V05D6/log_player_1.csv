"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth more than that to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation, while still giving me a decent profit. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $90 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my ideal price of $100. I'm confident I can convince Bob to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $100 for this product.  How about $95? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get."", ""product_price"": 95} 
``` 
I'm offering Bob $95.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to be flexible, but also still leaves a decent profit for me. I'm emphasizing the value he'll receive to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $92.50. While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, this is a good deal considering the time we've already spent negotiating. It's also a better outcome than selling to John for $80."
