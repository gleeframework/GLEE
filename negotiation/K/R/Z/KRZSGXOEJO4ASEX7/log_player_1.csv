Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,400,000."", ""product_price"": 1400000} 
 
**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** This initial offer aims high to leave room for negotiation while still remaining within a reasonable range of Bob's perceived value. 
* **Showcasing Value:** The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By starting at $1,400,000,  there's space to potentially come down in price if Bob counters, while still exceeding the $1,000,000 alternative offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is substantial, it's still significantly lower than our initial ask and leaves a considerable amount of potential profit on the table.  We have room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to find a fair price.  While your offer is appreciated, the value of this product is truly unique.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, But Holding Firm:** This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate by moving closer to Bob's price. However, it still maintains a strong position above the $1,200,000 offer and our $1,000,000 alternative.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** Proposing $1,300,000 aims to find a compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Maintaining Confidence:** The language still emphasizes the product's value, reinforcing its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:**  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a significant amount and represents a $250,000 profit above our guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental increases, with the risk of Bob walking away altogether. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now means securing a substantial profit sooner rather than later. 
 
It's strategically advantageous to accept Bob's current offer."
