{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My starting price is $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price yet.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can reach a deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a good price. I'm willing to drop to $145.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'd really like to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $135, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  I don't want to risk going lower and losing out on a better deal. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, so it's the safer option."
