"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. ",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $95.  How about we meet in the middle?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However,  $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference: $97.50.  That's a great price for both of us. What do you say?",97.5,Alice,5,
