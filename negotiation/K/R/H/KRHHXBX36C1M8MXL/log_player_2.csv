"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a great deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $80 to you, and Alice is offering it for $110. This is too high, so you should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is closer to your value, it's still higher than what you're willing to spend. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product and I'm willing to pay $95.  How about we meet in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However,  $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference: $97.50.  That's a great price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. At this point, it's more efficient to just buy the product from John for $80 and save yourself the hassle of further negotiation."
