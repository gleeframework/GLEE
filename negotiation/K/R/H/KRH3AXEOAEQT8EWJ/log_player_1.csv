I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd benefit greatly from it.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding an arrangement that works for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2200000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $1,200,000 at this time.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider.  This product has considerable value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial benefits. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 1850000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,850,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While a deal with Bob might still be possible, his offer is creeping up too slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach $1,500,000, and John represents a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price.  It's time to move on and secure the sure thing."
