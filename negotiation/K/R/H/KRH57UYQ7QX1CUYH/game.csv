"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $780000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price if we keep working together.",780000.0,Bob,4,
