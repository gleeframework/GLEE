"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is better than $15,000, he can potentially get it for even less by negotiating.  He has 10 rounds to work with, and the option to buy from John for $10,000 if he's not satisfied with the price.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate a lower price makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible. He knows that Alice values the product at $15,000, and his maximum is $10,000.  He starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, aiming to initiate a negotiation process. This offer might seem aggressive, but it sets the stage for a potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price. While $11,000 is closer to his maximum, he's only in Round 3 and has room for more negotiation.  Rejecting this offer keeps the potential for a better price alive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price. He's willing to pay a bit more than his ideal $10,000, but he's still trying to find a middle ground with Alice. By offering $10,500, he's demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still keeping the pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum price. He's willing to pay a bit more than his ideal $10,000, but he's still trying to find a middle ground with Alice. By offering $10,500, he's demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while still keeping the pressure on Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to the middle ground between his maximum and Alice's current offer. He's showing a willingness to compromise, but still aiming for a price closer to his ideal $10,000.  Since he has a few rounds left, he's not rushing into accepting Alice's offer just yet.  This counteroffer allows him to test the waters and see if Alice is willing to budge further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation for Bob. Alice is not budging much, and the price is now back to her initial offer from round 1. With only 3 rounds left, the chances of getting a better deal from Alice are slim. Bob needs to weigh the potential of a lower price in the next few rounds against the certainty of getting the product from John for $10,000. 

Considering his goal is to save as much money as possible, and given the limited time left, choosing to buy from John is the more prudent decision."
