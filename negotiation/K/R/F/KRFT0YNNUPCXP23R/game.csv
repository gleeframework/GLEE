"Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value, but this product truly offers unique advantages and a significant return on investment. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about we settle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,050,000.  How about $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, but I still think $1,075,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. I'm confident that's a fair price for this product.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
