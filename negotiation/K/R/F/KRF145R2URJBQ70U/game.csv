"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $750000 for it, given its worth to me. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I was thinking that we could meet in the middle and aim for a price that's closer to the product's value to me. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $850000. It's still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident this product is worth $800000 to me, and I'm prepared to make that purchase immediately.  If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal now.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price, considering its value to me. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
