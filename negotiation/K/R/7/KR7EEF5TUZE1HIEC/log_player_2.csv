"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$6,000 is a good starting point, but it's likely Alice is willing to go lower. There's no harm in trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $4,000 is a substantial discount from her initial offer and is well within my budget. This move should signal my seriousness in acquiring the product while also putting pressure on Alice to consider a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $5,500 is closer to my budget, I still believe there's room for negotiation. It's important to remember that I have 10 rounds to close the deal, and I haven't exhausted all options yet.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially secure an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $5,000. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal while still staying within my budget and creating room for a potential compromise.  Alice has already moved from $6,000 to $5,500, so I believe she is willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer.  $5,200 is a fair price, and I am confident that I can't negotiate much lower. Accepting this offer allows me to purchase the product for a price that is well within my budget and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer and potentially pushing the price higher."
