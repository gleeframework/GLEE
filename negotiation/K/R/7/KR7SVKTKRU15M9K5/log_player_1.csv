Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,280,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. We are aiming for a price closer to $1,350,000, and with 6 rounds remaining, there's a chance we can still reach a more favorable agreement."

Round 6

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is getting closer to our baseline, but we still have some negotiating room.  His offer is now only slightly above John's standing offer. We can risk one more round to see if he'll come up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be sure this deal makes sense for both of us. This is my final offer, $1,275,000.  It represents a significant discount on the product's true value."",
""product_price"": 1275000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to the wire. This offer represents a final compromise, splitting the difference between his last offer and our walk-away point. It's time for Bob to show his cards.  We'll accept no less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $1,230,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unwilling to meet our minimum acceptable price. It's clear he's trying to squeeze us as close to John's offer as possible.  We're better off taking John's guaranteed $1,200,000 than wasting more time with Bob and potentially getting even less."
