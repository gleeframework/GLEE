Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target:** My goal is to maximize my profit. 
* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Value to John:**  I have a guaranteed backup offer from John for $800,000.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm offering Bob a price of $1,000,000, which is higher than my guaranteed price from John but still significantly lower than the product's value to Bob. This provides Bob with a substantial discount and incentivizes him to accept the offer. 

By offering this price, I have a good chance of getting a higher price from Bob, while still guaranteeing myself a decent profit even if he rejects the offer."
