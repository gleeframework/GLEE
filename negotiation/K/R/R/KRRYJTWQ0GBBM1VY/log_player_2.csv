"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for us to work together. I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is closer to her own valuation than yours. There's a good chance we can negotiate a better price.  We're not in a rush, so it's worth seeing if we can get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This strategy aims to understand Alice's lower bound and potentially secure a good deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $11,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is moving towards our desired price point, but we can still try to push a bit further.  We're willing to walk away with John's offer, so we hold a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,750?"",
""product_price"": 9750
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're splitting the difference between our last offer and her counteroffer.  This shows willingness to negotiate but keeps us firmly in a good bargaining position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still open to negotiating. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,250. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's moving in small increments.  We're still better off holding out for a price closer to John's offer. We'll continue to apply pressure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To move things along, I'm willing to offer $10,000 even. That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're now matching John's offer.  This puts the pressure on Alice.  She can either accept our offer, which is a fair price, or risk losing the sale altogether. By presenting it as our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and limit further back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to meet me at $10,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer you the product for $10,100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unwilling to meet our price of $10,000, and her latest concession is minimal. It's unlikely she'll go much lower. We've successfully negotiated her down, but we're at a point where the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of further negotiation.  It's time to cut our losses and take John's offer, securing the product at our target price."
