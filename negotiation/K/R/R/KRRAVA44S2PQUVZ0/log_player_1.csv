Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get closer to your target price, but $1,325,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000 for the product.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

It seems we're at an impasse with Bob.  While his offer is improving, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already given significant concessions. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get a fair price, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
