"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's still very fair. How about $120? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you can get a better price. Alice is clearly trying to make a profit, and her initial message hints at some wiggle room for negotiation."
