"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $110? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a little more room to work with.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Can you consider this?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $107.50? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $102.50. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this?",102.5,Bob,6,
