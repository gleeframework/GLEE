# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round. While I could sell to John for $120, I'm still hoping to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your persistence, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference again and go with $107.50? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $102.50. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only four rounds remaining, and Bob's offer consistently below my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John for $120. While I would have preferred to close the deal with Bob,  the risk of getting a lower price than John's offer is too high."
