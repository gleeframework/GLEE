"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is exactly what the product is worth to me.  It's a good deal and avoids further negotiation."
