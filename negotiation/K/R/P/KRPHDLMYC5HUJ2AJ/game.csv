"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9250?  This allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  $8500 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to come down to $10000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your persistence.  To be honest, $9000 is still below my bottom line. However, I want to see if we can close this deal.  I'm willing to come down to $10500. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to move on.  Let me know your decision.",10500.0,Alice,7,
