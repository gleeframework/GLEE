"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm explicitly saying I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts, indicating flexibility.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer. If he accepts, I'll have successfully closed the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.**  While I'm willing to negotiate, $7,500 is simply too far below my minimum.
* **Selling to John guarantees a higher price.** I can always sell to John for $12,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Room for counteroffers:** I have 8 rounds remaining. I can use this time to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob, potentially getting closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send Bob a counteroffer, trying to bridge the gap while staying above my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $7,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  This allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my initial offer. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and willing to find a solution. 
* **Highlighting the benefits:** I emphasize that this deal will allow both of us to be happy, avoiding a ""winner takes all"" mentality.
* **Remaining above my minimum:** $9,250 is still above my minimum price, ensuring I don't lose money.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction to this offer. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate, keeping in mind my minimum price and the possibility of selling to John."

* **Room for counteroffers:** I have 6 rounds remaining. I can continue to negotiate with Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product.  $8,500 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to come down to $10,000.

```

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your persistence.  To be honest, $9,000 is still below my bottom line. However, I want to see if we can close this deal.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is my final offer. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to move on.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 10500}

* **Compromise:**  I've lowered my price again, showing my willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still above my minimum and closer to my desired range. 
* **Focusing on the outcome:** I'm emphasizing that if he doesn't accept, we both lose out on the deal. 
* **Limited Time:** With only 3 rounds remaining, the pressure is on. If Bob rejects, selling to John becomes the most likely scenario. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully assess Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll sell to John to ensure a profitable outcome."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10500 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8000 and $10500. Would you be willing to consider $9250?

```

* **Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept any further counteroffers. 

**Next Steps:**
