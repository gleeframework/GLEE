Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for this product, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking more along the lines of $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay. He can get the same product from John for $12,000, so there's no need to accept Alice's offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $14,000 is closer, I'm still limited to $12,000. This is my final offer, as I can buy the product elsewhere for that price. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
