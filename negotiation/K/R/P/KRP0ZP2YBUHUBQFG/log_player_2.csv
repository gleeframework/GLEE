Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $200 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $175. This is a great compromise, considering the product is worth $150 to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $175 was still a bit too high for you. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $155. This is a very competitive price, considering the product is worth $150 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $155.  Since you can get the product for $150 from John, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed lower price rather than risk Alice not budging any further."
