"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. However, given my budget constraints, I can't agree to $1,400,000. I would like to propose $1,200,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  I'm proposing $1,300,000. This gives us both room to make a deal.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering your latest offer, I would like to counter with $1,250,000. I believe this strikes a balance between our positions.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
