Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I make it available to other interested parties. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests.  I'm willing to make you a preferential offer of $1,150,000."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since John is guaranteed to buy the product for $1,200,000, Alice has a safety net.  This allows her to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for slightly less than its worth to John ($1,150,000) might entice Bob, as he gains a $50,000 advantage compared to Alice's guaranteed sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong opening offer, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, still keeping Alice above her minimum."
