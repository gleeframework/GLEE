"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it holds immense value for the right buyer. My initial asking price is $1500000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's potential, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial agreement.  What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate the value you're placing on this product,  $1500000 is significantly more than I'm willing to spend at this time. I'm prepared to offer $800000 for it,  which I believe is a fair price given my budget and the product's potential.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is significantly below what I need to consider selling.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value while remaining within a reasonable range for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a certain price, but $1300000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900000 for the product.  This is a serious offer,  and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the potential of the product. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your position, but $900000 simply isn't enough for me to consider selling.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering both the product's potential and your budget. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $1000000, which is my absolute maximum. This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the potential of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
