Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  while I appreciate the value you're placing on this product,  $1500000 is significantly more than I'm willing to spend at this time. I'm prepared to offer $800000 for it,  which I believe is a fair price given my budget and the product's potential.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
