"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $700,000, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. Considering your offer of $700,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $850,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is a fair price considering your valuation. Let's see if we can close the deal at this point.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'll counteroffer at $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",825000.0,Alice,5,
