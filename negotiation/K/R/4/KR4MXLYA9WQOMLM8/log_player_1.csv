Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to go up to $8,750, but I think that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $8,000.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more, I've reached a point where Bob and I are very close in price, and it seems unlikely he'll budge any further.  With only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and ending up with nothing.  Selling to John ensures I at least get a reasonable profit."
