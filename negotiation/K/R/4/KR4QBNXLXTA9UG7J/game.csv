"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we settle at $9,500? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as high as $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to me is $15,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,5,
