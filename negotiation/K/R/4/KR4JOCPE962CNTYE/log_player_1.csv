Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price given its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming to get more than $12,000, so this price is a good starting point.
* **It's within Bob's range:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, so he's likely to consider an offer at or slightly above that.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You're not asking for the full $15,000 (the maximum you could potentially get), leaving space for Bob to counter and for you to negotiate. 

Remember, this is just the first offer. You'll need to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  Selling to John at this point would guarantee you a better outcome. However, rejecting Bob's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a higher price.  You can counter with a price closer to your initial offer, aiming for a compromise that benefits both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,250? This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me."", ""product_price"": 12250}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Reasoning:**  This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Bob's offer and your initial offer. It's a compromise that demonstrates your willingness to negotiate while still staying above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Strategy:**  By meeting Bob halfway, you show flexibility and create a sense of urgency. This might encourage Bob to accept, rather than risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Communication:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and highlights the benefits of accepting the offer for both parties.  

It's important to be aware that Bob might still reject this offer and counter again. You'll need to assess the situation and make decisions based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $11,800? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,800 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $12,000 you can get from John. The negotiation process has gone back and forth, and it's clear that finding a mutually agreeable price is proving difficult.  

**Why selling to John is the best option:**

* **Guaranteed Price:** John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is your minimum acceptable price and guarantees you won't lose money.
* **Time Savings:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag the process out further, potentially costing you more time and effort.
* **Potential for Further Lower Offers:** There's a risk that Bob could continue lowering his offer, further decreasing your profit.

It's a wise decision to end the negotiation with Bob and sell to John to secure a fair and immediate sale."
