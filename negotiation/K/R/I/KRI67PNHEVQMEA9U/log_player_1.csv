"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to try to counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me. Would you consider $13,500? This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I think I can still get a better deal. I'm going to try to counteroffer again and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $12,500 is definitely closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe you'll find this product to be a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to sell now, I think I can still get a better price.  I'll try to counteroffer Bob and see if we can bridge the gap.  I'm not quite ready to settle for $12,250 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $12,750? This is a good price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the value this product offers. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, I've already rejected his offers a few times, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  $12,500 is a good price, significantly better than selling to John.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely."
