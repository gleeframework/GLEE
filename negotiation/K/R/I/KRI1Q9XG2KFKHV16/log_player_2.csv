{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $110, which is still a good deal for me, and a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. This leaves room for Alice to come down a bit if she wants to make a sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $117
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer, and $117 is still within my acceptable range.  It's closer to my target price than buying from John, so I'll accept."
