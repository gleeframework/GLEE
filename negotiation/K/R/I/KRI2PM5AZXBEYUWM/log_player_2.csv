"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $140. I think you'll really love it and it's a great deal for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good deal, you can get the product for $150 from John. Since your maximum budget is $150, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John, even though it's slightly more expensive."
