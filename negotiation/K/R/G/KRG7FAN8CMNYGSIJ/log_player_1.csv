Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. It's a great deal for something of such high quality."", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I was hoping for a lower price. Would you consider selling it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to stick to my bottom line. I know John will buy the product for $120, guaranteeing me the minimum amount I'm willing to accept."
