"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $95 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $97.50. This is a fair price for both of us and ensures a win-win situation. What do you say?",97.5,Alice,5,
