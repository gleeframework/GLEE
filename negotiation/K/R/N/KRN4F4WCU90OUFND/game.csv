"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $120. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm now offering the product to you for $100. It's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
