"Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your generosity, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling the product for $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already factored in a discount from my initial offer. I can do $135, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",135.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I believe we can come to an agreement closer to my desired price. Could you consider $120 for the product?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not on the same page, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. That's my final compromise on the price.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $125?",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying the product, Bob. I've already dropped the price to $130 and now you're asking for $125? I'm willing to make one more concession, but that's as low as I can go. I'll sell it to you for $132. That's my final offer.",132.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry to hear that, Alice. I understand your position, but unfortunately, I still can't agree to $132. Could you consider $128?",128.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with these back-and-forth negotiations, Bob. I've already given you a great deal, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll sell it to you for $130, but that's it. No more concessions from me.",130.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Considering our previous discussions, I believe $128 is a fair price for the product. I hope you can reconsider and match this offer.",128.0,Bob,10,
