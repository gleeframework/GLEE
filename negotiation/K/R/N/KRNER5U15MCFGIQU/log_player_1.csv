Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant amount more than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's current offer, and allows for some wiggle room for a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's only slightly higher than what I could get from John, it's worth it to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price."
