"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($800,000) to provide room for negotiation and potentially secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). 
* **Strategic Positioning:** The $1,100,000 offer anchors the negotiation high. While it's possible Bob might reject it outright, it sets a strong precedent and suggests I value the product highly. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message emphasizes that this is a ""starting point"" and that I'm looking for a ""mutually beneficial deal,"" signaling my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I think your initial price is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than both my initial asking price and Bob's perceived value.  I believe there's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm willing to walk away unless a more favorable deal is reached. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is simply too low considering the true value of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,000,000? This reflects my commitment to finding a fair agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  By proposing $1,000,000, I'm demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise, but I'm still holding firm at a price significantly above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is a significant concession on my part and represents a fair compromise. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  While I haven't explicitly mentioned John, the fact that I'm willing to walk away from $900,000 suggests I have other options and Bob should act decisively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. Let's try $950,000 and see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $950,000 represents a $150,000 profit over my minimum acceptable price. This is a significant return.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has incrementally increased his offer throughout the negotiation, indicating he's serious about buying and willing to pay a premium.
* **Time Value:**  While I could potentially push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that continued negotiation will erode the potential profit. Closing the deal now ensures a substantial gain."
