"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to make a fair offer to get us started.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $8,000. Let's start there and see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we try $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $9,000.  It's a fair compromise and allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but $9,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to think about it. How about we try $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $10,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,000 is still not enough for me to meet my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about it. How about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,7,
