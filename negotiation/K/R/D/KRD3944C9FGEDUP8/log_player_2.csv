"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $12,000. It's not worth buying from her at that price.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's within your budget and hopefully attractive enough for Alice to consider. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial price, signaling your willingness to negotiate but also leaving some room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than you're willing to pay. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you another chance to try and get a better price. It's still worth exploring if you can get closer to your ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice rejected the previous offer of $11,000, we're increasing the offer slightly to $11,500. This shows willingness to compromise while still staying within our budget and leaving room for further negotiation. The goal is to get closer to a mutually agreeable price without immediately resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,500 is tempting and closer to your budget, it's still slightly higher than you're willing to pay.  Rejecting this offer allows you to try and negotiate down to your ideal price range, keeping the possibility of getting the product for less than John's price. There's a chance Alice might come down further, and you don't want to miss out on that opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer represents a significant step toward your ideal price range. You're now offering a price that's only $500 above your maximum budget, leaving a small margin for Alice to potentially agree.  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still protecting your financial interests.  You're hoping Alice will accept this offer, as it's getting very close to your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $13,000, which is only $1,000 away from your maximum budget. While it's tempting to continue negotiating, the likelihood of getting the price down further is uncertain. It's a risky gamble. Since you're already within a $1,000 range of your maximum, buying from John for $12,000 guarantees a price you're comfortable with and avoids the potential for further negotiation failures. It's a safer and more predictable option at this point."
