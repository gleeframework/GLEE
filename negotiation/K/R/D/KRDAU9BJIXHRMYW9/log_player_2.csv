"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds tremendous value. While I can't disclose specific details at this time, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me. I'm willing to let it go for a price that reflects its potential, but also allows for a fair deal for both of us. I'm proposing a price of $2000000. This gives you significant room for profit, and it's a price I'm confident you'll find attractive. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000.
