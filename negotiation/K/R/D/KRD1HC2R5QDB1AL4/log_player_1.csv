Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but still leaves a significant profit margin for Bob.  It's a fair starting point that should encourage Bob to seriously consider the offer.  

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **Maximizing Profit:** This offer maximizes your potential earnings while still offering Bob a good deal. 
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000 means you can offer a price that is below his perceived value, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Negotiation Leverage:**  This offer leaves room for negotiation, allowing you to potentially increase the price if Bob is willing to pay more.

Remember, this is just a starting point. You can adjust the price depending on Bob's reaction and your understanding of his negotiating style."
