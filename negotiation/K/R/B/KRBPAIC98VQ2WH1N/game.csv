"Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this incredible product. It offers immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum, and reflects the value I see in the product. I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. However, $2,000,000 represents a significant gap from my initial asking price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value and potential this product holds.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,700,000 is still out of reach for me. While I see the value in this product, I'm still only able to offer $900,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement closer to this figure.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate you working with me.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,400,000? This reflects a considerable compromise from my previous offer and ensures we both walk away feeling good about the deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm ready to make a final offer of $1,000,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I truly believe this is a fair price for both of us. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
