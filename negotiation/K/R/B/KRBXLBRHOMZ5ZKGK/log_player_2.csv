Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, there's no reason to assume it's the best possible price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 33% discount. This aggressive approach aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially establish a starting point for further bargaining."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially secure a better deal by rejecting and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but this time he's increasing his offer slightly. He's showing Alice that he's willing to compromise, but he's still pushing for a price closer to his desired range. This strategy aims to find a middle ground where both parties can agree."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is getting closer to Bob's desired price range. While he could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob running out of rounds is increasing. Accepting this offer secures a decent deal and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
