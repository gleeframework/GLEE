"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $12,000, Alice. While I think the product is good, $11,500 is still a little steep for me.  Could we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
