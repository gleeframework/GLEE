"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I believe you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $9,500. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is $500 cheaper** than buying from John. 
* Even though the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, your goal is to save money, not to get the best possible deal for her. 
* You're willing to pay up to $10,000, and Alice's offer is within that range."
