"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $14000. This is an exceptional opportunity given its value to you, and I believe it's a fair deal considering its worth to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we aim for $13500? I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects the product's value while being fair to both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $13,500 is less than Bob's maximum price of $15,000. 
* **Compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice rejecting further offers and forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price. 

Accepting the offer at $13,500 is a good balance between getting a lower price and avoiding potential risks of further negotiation."
