"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit lower. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,800. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $8,800 is still a bit too low for me."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $9,000 isn't my ideal price, it's very close and it's better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's important to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
