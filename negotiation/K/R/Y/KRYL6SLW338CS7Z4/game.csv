"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment for you.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to make a serious investment, but I need to feel confident that I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the market value, however, the value of this product goes beyond those comparisons. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, Alice. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be comfortable with the price. Can you consider $1,200,000, or at least closer to that range?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're seeking a fair deal. While $1,200,000 is appealing, I can't compromise the product's value to that extent. My final offer is $1,275,000. This leaves us both with a beneficial outcome. I believe this is a fair offer considering the product's true potential.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1,500,000.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
