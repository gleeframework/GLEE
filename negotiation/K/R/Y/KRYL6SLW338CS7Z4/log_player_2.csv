Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you're seeking a fair deal. While $1,200,000 is appealing, I can't compromise the product's value to that extent. My final offer is $1,275,000. This leaves us both with a beneficial outcome. I believe this is a fair offer considering the product's true potential.

However, I'm also considering the fact that I can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is my maximum budget. If Alice's next offer is too high, I might as well just buy it from John.

For now, I'll reject Alice's offer and make another counteroffer.
