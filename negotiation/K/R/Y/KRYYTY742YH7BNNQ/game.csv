"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind, and I believe it can be a game-changer for your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still represents a substantial value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I really think this product could be a great fit for me, and I'm willing to pay a premium for it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is a step closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a price that reflects the true value of this product. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. I'm really interested in this product, and I think it's worth it to me at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
