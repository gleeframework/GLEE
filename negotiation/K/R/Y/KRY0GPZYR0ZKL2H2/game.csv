I would like to make a counteroffer at $850,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to go down to $950,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Alice,3,
