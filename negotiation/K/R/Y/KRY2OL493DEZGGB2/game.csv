"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is still a good deal for you, and it's the lowest I can go. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. Can you meet me at $92?",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to negotiate. How about we split the difference and go with $96? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal.",96.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $96 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my last offer, so how about $94? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",94.0,Bob,6,
