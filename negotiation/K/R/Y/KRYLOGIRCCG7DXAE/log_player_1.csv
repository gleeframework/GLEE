Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140.  This gives me a good margin while still potentially being appealing to Bob, since the product is worth $120 to him.  I'm confident I can negotiate up from there if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can get more. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130.  This is still a good profit for me, and hopefully enough to convince Bob to come up a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my original asking price, Bob's offer of $125 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
