"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit further, but I need to see a higher offer. How about $825,000? This price is still within a reasonable range for both of us. Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",825000.0,Alice,3,
