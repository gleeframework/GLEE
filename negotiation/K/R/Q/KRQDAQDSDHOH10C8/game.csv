"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $10,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $6,000 undervalues the product significantly. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $9,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing a price of $7,500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,500 is close, but to be fair to both of us, I propose a final price of $8,500. This reflects the true value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",8200.0,Bob,6,
