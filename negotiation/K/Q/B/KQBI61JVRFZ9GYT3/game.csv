"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. How about we settle around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $850,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $1,050,000. This still offers you a substantial benefit considering its worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
