"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I'm aiming to pay significantly less than $180, so it's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($110) to give myself room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  While my offer is low, I'm being polite and framing it as a question rather than a demand. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer helps me gauge Alice's flexibility and how low she might be willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $160.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's fair to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down a bit, $160 is still significantly more than my target price and what John is offering.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there's still room to lower the price further. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I have the safety net of buying from John for $150 if needed, so I'm not desperate to accept a price I'm not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between her last offer ($160) and my previous counteroffer ($110). This strategy often feels fair to both parties and can help move negotiations along.
* **Strategic Positioning:** $135 puts me in a good position. It's a significant savings compared to her offer and allows room to negotiate a bit higher if needed, while still staying below my $150 limit and John's offer.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I continue to be polite and respectful to ensure a smooth negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $135 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $142.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Marginally Better:** While $142.50 is closer to my ideal price, it's still a bit more than I want to pay, especially considering John's offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** Alice seems committed to this price by suggesting the split, but I want to see if she's willing to budge just a little more. 
* **Limited Risk:** With several rounds left, I have a little room to negotiate without risking the deal too much. I can always accept her offer in the next round if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice!  I'm willing to go up to $138, but that's really as high as I can go."",
""product_price"": 138
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing my offer slightly to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but I'm keeping the increase small ($3) to signal I'm nearing my limit. 
* **Setting a Firm Limit:**  By saying ""$138 is as high as I can go,"" I'm hoping to nudge Alice closer to my price point.
* **Time Constraint:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation, so I want to create a sense of urgency without being pushy."
