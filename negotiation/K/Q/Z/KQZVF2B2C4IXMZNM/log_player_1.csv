"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This leaves some room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. I'm confident Bob will find this offer attractive as he values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $11,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to go higher in the next round.  I still have a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $11,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in closing the deal at this price."
