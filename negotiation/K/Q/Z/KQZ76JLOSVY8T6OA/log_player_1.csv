Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can't justify paying more than $800,000 at this time. I'm confident this is a fair price considering my intended use of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.
