"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $7,800. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",7800.0,Alice,3,
