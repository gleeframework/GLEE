"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer in its industry, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1400000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1800000. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiating further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1600000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I don't think I can go any higher than that.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1600000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one last concession. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I can only go up to $1650000. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
