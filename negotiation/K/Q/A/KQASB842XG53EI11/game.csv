"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering its value.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is too far below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a compromise here.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but I need to stay within my budget.  How about $950,000? That's a significant move on my part and shows I'm serious about making this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to both get a good deal. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
