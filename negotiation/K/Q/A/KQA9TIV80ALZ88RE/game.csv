"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy my product from you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $22000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to the right buyer.",22000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $22000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $22000 might be a stretch, but I'm not willing to go as low as $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm offering the product to you for $19000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm not willing to go above $19000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $19000, so I'll offer $16500. Can you consider this price?",16500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $16500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $18000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",18000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $18000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $17000 and $18000, so I'll offer $17250. Can you consider this price?",17250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1750 above your last offer. I'll sell the product to you for $18000. This is my final offer.",18000.0,Alice,7,
