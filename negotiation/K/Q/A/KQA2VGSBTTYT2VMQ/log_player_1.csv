Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000,  getting Bob to buy it allows us to potentially make even more profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to accept the offer quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This initial offer is just the starting point. If Bob counters, we can then negotiate towards a price that is mutually beneficial, always keeping in mind our guaranteed sale to John at $1,500,000."
