{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, Bob has a good chance of getting a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This move aims to set the negotiation tone and demonstrate Bob's desire to pay a price closer to Alice's valuation. The counteroffer is still within Bob's budget, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still determined to get a lower price. He has 7 rounds left, and Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing that he is serious about buying the product.  This counteroffer is still significantly lower than Alice's last offer but is getting closer to a potential deal. This move also keeps the pressure on Alice to make a concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,200, which is a good price for Bob. He's already pushed the negotiations far, and while he could try for a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and potentially going back up to a higher price exists. With only 5 rounds left, it's a good time to accept the offer and secure a good deal."
