"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price point. However, $8,500 is still a bit high for me. Could you do $7,500? That would work for me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $7,500 is still below my minimum. Let's compromise at $8,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
