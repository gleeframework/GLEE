Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and would allow us to both benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
