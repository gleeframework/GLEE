"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and would allow us to both benefit from the deal.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product has tremendous value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's still a significant discount from the original price.
