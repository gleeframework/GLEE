Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, starting higher allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a better deal for Alice. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The message implies Alice is open to discussing the price,  giving Bob a chance to counter-offer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Highlighting value:** The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" and mentioning the product's ""value and potential"" are subtle ways to justify the high price and pique Bob's interest.

**Worst-case scenario:** Bob rejects the offer. Alice can then sell the product to John for her minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.

**Best-case scenario:** Bob accepts the offer or negotiates down to a price still higher than $1,200,000, earning Alice a profit."
