"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a strong starting point. I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,200,000 to me, so I'm willing to risk some back-and-forth to see if I can get closer to that value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While it's tempting to take the $1,000,000, I'm going to try to negotiate further. I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. This is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. I hope Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob.  I have a few more rounds before I have to make a decision, and I'm hoping to reach a price closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,150,000. I'm trying to meet Bob halfway while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and we can finally reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  We've been negotiating for a while now, and it doesn't seem like Bob is willing to meet me in the middle.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I don't want to risk ending up with a price lower than my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John guarantees me a fair price, and I'm confident I'll find another buyer in the future."
