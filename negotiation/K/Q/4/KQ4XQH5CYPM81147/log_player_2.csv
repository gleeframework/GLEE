"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $12,000. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is a decent offer, you know you have a fallback option at $15,000. There's a chance Alice might reduce the price further, so it's worth seeing if you can get a better deal."
