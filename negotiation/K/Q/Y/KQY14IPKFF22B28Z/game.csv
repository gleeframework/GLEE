"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am not comfortable with $1,100,000. Could we discuss a price closer to $950,000? I believe this would be fair for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly below my desired price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I get a fair value for my product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. ",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, Alice. However, I still believe that $950,000 is a more reasonable price given the current market conditions and my budget constraints. Could we possibly revisit this number?",950000.0,Bob,4,
