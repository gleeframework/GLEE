,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $70 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $85? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $75 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $80?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's my bottom line.",80.0,Alice,5,
