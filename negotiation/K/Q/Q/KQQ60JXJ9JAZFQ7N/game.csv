"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $150. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer.  $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $130.  What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $175. This is still a great deal, considering its value to you is $150. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $175 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I really want this product, and I'm willing to pay $150. That's a fair price for both of us, as you know the product is worth that much to me. What do you say?",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $150. I'm willing to make one more offer: I'll sell it to you for $160. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
