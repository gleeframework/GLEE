"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects the product's real value, and it allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that $1,050,000 is a bit out of my range. I would like to propose an offer of $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this price respects the value of the item while staying within my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
