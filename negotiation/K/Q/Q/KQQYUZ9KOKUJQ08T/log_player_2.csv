# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it will greatly benefit you. Considering its value and the benefits it provides, I propose a price of $13500 for it. This is a special offer tailored to your needs, taking into account its worth to you at $12000. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Bob can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable spending.  I'm happy to pay $12,500 for the product, as that would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 12500}
