"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm looking to sell it to you for $850000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I'm still confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $800000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $800,000, which is a significant drop from her initial offer.  This is a reasonable price for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer saves Bob $200,000 compared to buying from John.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk of losing the deal altogether is too high at this point."
