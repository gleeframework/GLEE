Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $15,000, but it still leaves me with a decent profit. I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while still leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $10,000. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still above his current offer and closer to my minimum value. I believe this is a fair price that demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,500 is too low for me.  It's below my minimum value and the negotiation is becoming time-consuming. I'm better off selling to John for $15,000, securing a much better deal and avoiding further negotiation."
