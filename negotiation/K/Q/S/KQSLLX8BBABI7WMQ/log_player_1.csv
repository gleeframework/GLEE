Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your needs, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming slightly lower gives you a chance to get a better deal from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for you while still presenting a significant discount for Bob. This might be tempting enough for him to accept.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have a way to communicate the value of the product to Bob effectively so he understands why paying $1,400,000 is a good deal for him."
