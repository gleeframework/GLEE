"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can meet you in the middle at $11,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about $10,000? I think that's a fair price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, Bob. I can do $11,500, but I don't think I can go any lower than that. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",11500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is my final offer. If that doesn't work, I think I'll have to explore other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand you're trying to make a final offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go above $11,500. I can do $11,250, but that's as high as I can go. It's a good price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",11250.0,Alice,7,
