"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay. You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to your target price, it's still a bit more than you'd ideally like to spend. You have room to continue negotiating and potentially get closer to your goal of $105."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $115 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $110.  That's a fair price considering what we've discussed so far, and it gets us much closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet at $112.50? I think that's a fair price for the product's value, and it's a good compromise between our two numbers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $112.5 is a good compromise, you're still within your budget and have room to negotiate. It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially since Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise. You're likely to get closer to your desired price point with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, Alice.  $112.5 is closer to my target, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $111?  That's a small step towards your price, but it's the best I can do at this point."", ""product_price"": 111}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go down to $111, Bob. I think the product's value is worth more than that. How about we meet at $113? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but it's a fair price considering the product's value and the value you placed on it at $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $113. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $113
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now being stubborn and is unwilling to budge further. You've already tried multiple counteroffers, and the price is getting close to your limit. It's not worth risking another round of negotiation, especially with only 3 rounds left. John's offer is within your budget, and you're guaranteed a purchase."
