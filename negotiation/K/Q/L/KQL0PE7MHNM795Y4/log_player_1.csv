Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $115 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $110.  That's a fair price considering what we've discussed so far, and it gets us much closer to a deal.
