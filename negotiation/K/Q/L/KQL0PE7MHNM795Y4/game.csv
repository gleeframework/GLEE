"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. Is this something you'd be interested in?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product but $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $115? I think that's a fair price for the product's value.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $115 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $110.  That's a fair price considering what we've discussed so far, and it gets us much closer to a deal.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still a bit short. How about we meet at $112.50? I think that's a fair price for the product's value, and it's a good compromise between our two numbers.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice.  $112.5 is closer to my target, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. How about $111?  That's a small step towards your price, but it's the best I can do at this point.",111.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go down to $111, Bob. I think the product's value is worth more than that. How about we meet at $113? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but it's a fair price considering the product's value and the value you placed on it at $150.",113.0,Alice,7,
