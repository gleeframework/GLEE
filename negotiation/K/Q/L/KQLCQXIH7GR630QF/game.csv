"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we settle at $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident that you'll find it's a great value at this price.",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, I can't justify going above $10,500.  If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,6,
