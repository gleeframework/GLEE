# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value to you, we believe it's worth $100. This is a great opportunity to secure a high-quality item at a reasonable cost. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($100 vs $120 max).** This means you're getting a better deal than buying from John.
* **While the product is worth $80 to Alice, the offer is still above her value.** This indicates a potential profit for her, making it more likely she'll be willing to sell at this price. 

By accepting the offer, you save $20 compared to buying from John."
