Round 4
Bob's offer:

Explanation:

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $14,000 makes the most sense at this point:

* **Profitable:** $14,000 is still a $1,000 profit over my minimum.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing negotiations has no guarantee of a better offer. Bob might not budge much higher, and I risk him walking away entirely. 
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations.

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it for a potentially slightly better one later.
