"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get it at a price that's lower than its market value. I'm willing to let it go for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I need to make a profit. I can meet you in the middle at $165. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. How about $135?  That's a fair price and I'm ready to close the deal today if you're okay with it.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $155, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great value for the product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be honest, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $150.  If you're able to match that price, I'm ready to buy from you right now.  Otherwise, I'll need to consider my other option.",150.0,Bob,6,
