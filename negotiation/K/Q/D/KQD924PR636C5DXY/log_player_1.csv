At this point, I've reached the limit of my flexibility. Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum price, but not quite there. I've only got two rounds left, and it seems like we're at a stalemate.  It's better to take the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk losing more time and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob."
