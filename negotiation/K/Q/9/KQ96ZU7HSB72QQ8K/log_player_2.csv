"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth to someone like you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential return on investment for your specific needs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, it still costs more than the product is worth to Bob.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can then buy from John for $1,000,000, which is his maximum price."
