"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price, given the value of the product. Let's make this deal happen!",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $6,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $7,250 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $8,000? That's a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's close this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
