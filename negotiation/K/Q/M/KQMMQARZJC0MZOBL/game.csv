"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate that. However, $1,075,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but only to $1,100,000. This is my final offer. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
