{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $200 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leave room for negotiation. I'm also trying to create a sense of value for Bob to encourage him to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $175.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway while still staying above my minimum price. I'm also emphasizing my willingness to negotiate to keep the conversation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $150. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could potentially continue negotiating, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer from Bob.  Additionally, selling to John would also net me $150. Therefore, I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product to him."
