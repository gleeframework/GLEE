"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower. There's a lot of room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He's starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation. This aggressive counteroffer will test Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially force her to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still $100,000 more than his last counteroffer.  There's still room to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue exploring if he can get the product for closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing his willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's last offer. This counteroffer is a compromise that might be more attractive to Alice while keeping Bob within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $550,000 is still significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000, making it a good deal for Bob.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice might reject future offers and he would be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting this offer secures the product for Bob at a price that's within his budget."
