"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my desired price point. I have 10 rounds and can make counteroffers. By rejecting, I can potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a deal closer to my maximum price point while leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $12,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my desired price, I still have room to negotiate.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to hear you're willing to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,500?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground, showing a willingness to compromise while still staying within my price range.  $12,500 is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Alice will see it as a good deal for her as well."
