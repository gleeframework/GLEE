We're getting close, but there's still room to negotiate. Alice is coming down in increments, so continuing the back and forth is likely to yield a better price."

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and this price is a good deal compared to John's offer.  Taking the sure thing at $11,300 makes sense now."
