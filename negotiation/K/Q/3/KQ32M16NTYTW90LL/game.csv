"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $250. This is a great deal, considering its true value is worth much more. What do you think?",250.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $250 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? I think that's a fair price considering its value.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $250 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $180. This is a great compromise, considering the product's true value. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $180. Would you be willing to consider a price of $140? I think that's a more reasonable price for me.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $160. This is a fair price, considering the product's value. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not comfortable paying $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $150. I think that's a fair price for me.",150.0,Bob,6,
