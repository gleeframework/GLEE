Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value that would benefit you greatly."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We know Bob values the product at $15,000. Offering it slightly below his perceived value ($14,000) maximizes our potential profit while still being attractive to Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a strong initial offer, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he desires, potentially leading to an even higher sale price.
* **Secure a Good Deal Quickly:** This strategy prioritizes securing a deal with Bob, who is willing to pay more than our backup buyer, John."
