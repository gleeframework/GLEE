"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1100000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1100000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950000 is a bit too far below my asking price.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This price still reflects the product's value and potential, while allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1050000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  To make this work, I'm willing to offer $1000000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my budget. I believe it's a good deal for both of us, and it could help us finalize the deal quickly. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
