Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking for $18,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Enthusiasm:**  The message expresses confidence in the product's value and a belief that it's a good fit for Bob. This might make him more inclined to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message explicitly states that I'm open to discussing the price, signaling that I'm not inflexible.

**Next Steps:**

I'll observe Bob's reaction. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter back, keeping in mind my minimum price of $12,000 and the potential sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm really interested, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $12000? I'm serious about buying it if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Avoiding Risk:**  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better price by counter-offering.  It's possible Bob will walk away, leaving me with only the $12,000 offer from John.
* **Securing the Deal:**  By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale at my minimum acceptable price.  This minimizes risk and ensures a positive outcome."
