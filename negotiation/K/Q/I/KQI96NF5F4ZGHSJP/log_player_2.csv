"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $100 to you, and we're willing to let it go for $95. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $95 is still below your maximum budget, it's a significant markup from Alice's own valuation of $80. 
* **Negotiation is worth exploring:**  There's room for a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but $95 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85, which is still a good price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your offer. However, I need to maintain a minimum price for my product to ensure profitability. Would you be willing to consider $90 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $90 is better than $95, it's still above my ideal price point. 
* **More negotiation is possible:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I can potentially get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations fall apart, I can still buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $90 is still too high for me. I'm happy to pay $87. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I've considered your offer and am willing to negotiate further. How about $88 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to my target:** $88 is only $2 more than my last offer, and it's within my budget.
* **Risk of going too low:**  If I reject this offer and counter again, there's a chance Alice will walk away, forcing me to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Time is a factor:**  We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a reasonable price."
