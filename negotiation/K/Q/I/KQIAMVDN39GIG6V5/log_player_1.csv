Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth while staying within my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I recognize the value in the product, I must respectfully decline at $2,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. I believe this price better aligns with the current market value and my budget.

This is the best possible outcome for you, Alice. Here's why:

* **Meeting your minimum:** Bob's offer matches the minimum price you're willing to accept ($1,500,000). 
* **John's offer:**  While John offers the same price, continuing the negotiation with Bob introduces risk. Bob might lower his offer in subsequent rounds.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now avoids potential delays and uncertainties involved in further negotiations."
