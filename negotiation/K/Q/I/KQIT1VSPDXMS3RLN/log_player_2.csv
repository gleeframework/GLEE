# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been designed to meet your specific needs.

Don't miss out on this opportunity to experience the superior quality firsthand. If you're interested, please let me know so we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer matches your maximum price, there's no incentive to accept immediately.  You're looking to save money, and there's a chance Alice might lower the price if you reject her initial offer. By rejecting, you're not losing anything since you can always buy from John at the same price."
