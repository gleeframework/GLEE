"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a bit above the midpoint between my minimum value ($80) and Bob's perceived value ($120). This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit margin for me.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and inviting tone in my message to build rapport with Bob and encourage a positive interaction.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for negotiation by asking Bob what he thinks. This signals that I'm willing to find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Room:** Bob's counteroffer of $90 is still higher than my minimum value of $80.  This means there's still room for me to negotiate and potentially earn more. 
* **Potential for Better Price:**  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired amount. This could potentially lead to a higher final price.
* **Not Desperate:** Accepting his offer would secure a sale, but I'm not desperate to sell.  I can wait to see if Bob is willing to come up to a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! $90 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping for a little more to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $95? I'm sure we can find a happy medium."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $95, which is closer to my ideal price but still demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly by acknowledging Bob's offer and expressing hope for a mutually beneficial outcome.
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm subtly reinforcing the value of the product by mentioning ""making this worthwhile."" This implies that the price needs to reflect the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $92 is only $3 away from my ideal price. This is a good deal, considering my minimum is $80.
* **Risk of Losing Sale:**  If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and I might be forced to sell to John for a lower price.
* **Time is Limited:** We're already in round 4, and I don't want to risk losing out on a potential sale with only 6 rounds left. 

I'm happy to accept this offer, as it's a good deal and secures a sale for me."
