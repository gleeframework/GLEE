"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay, but I'm willing to make a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, considering its value. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $1,000,000.  It's a fair price, and it gets the deal done.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $950,000 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $1,050,000.  Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $1,050,000. I'm still at $950,000, and I think that's a fair price. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",950000.0,Bob,6,
