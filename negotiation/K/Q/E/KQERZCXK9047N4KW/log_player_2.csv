"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than the product's value to her. There's room for negotiation to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $135. Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $135, which is within my budget and a good deal for me. Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product at a price lower than what I would pay from John."
