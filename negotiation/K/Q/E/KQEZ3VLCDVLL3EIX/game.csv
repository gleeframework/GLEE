"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to offer $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low right now.  The product is truly worth more than that, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,750, which is a fair compromise.  I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're working towards a deal, but $10,750 just doesn't quite cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's get this deal done!",11000.0,Alice,5,
