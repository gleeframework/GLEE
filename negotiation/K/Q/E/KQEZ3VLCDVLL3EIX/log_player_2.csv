"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000 from John, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low right now.  The product is truly worth more than that, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value.  I'm willing to come down to $11,250. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $11,250 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. By rejecting this offer, Bob can continue the negotiation and potentially secure an even lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $11,250 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $10,750, which is a fair compromise.  I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're working towards a deal, but $10,750 just doesn't quite cover the value of this product for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still getting the product.
* **Current situation:** Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's a significant improvement from her previous offer and much lower than John's price. 
* **Potential risks:** If Bob rejects and tries to counteroffer again, Alice might get frustrated and walk away, leaving Bob to pay John's higher price. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer at $11,000 allows Bob to achieve his goal of buying the product while still saving money compared to John's price. It's a reasonable compromise that both parties can accept."
