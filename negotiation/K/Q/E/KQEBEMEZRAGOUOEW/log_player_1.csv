{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A price of $20,000 represents a reasonable markup while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Bob, given that the product is worth $15,000 to him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting higher allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  

By starting with this offer, you increase your chances of getting a better price than your fallback option with John."
