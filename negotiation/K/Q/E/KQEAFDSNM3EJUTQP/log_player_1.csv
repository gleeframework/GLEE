Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1500000} 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming high, as I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me.  If Bob rejects this offer, we can then start negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$750,000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low price without at least trying to get closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I still believe the product is worth more than $750,000.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm now willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a fair offer considering the product's value and Bob's previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob has shown he's not willing to go higher than $850,000.  John is offering my minimum acceptable price, so it's time to move on and secure the sale with him."
