Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without directly stating it. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  By asking for Bob's thoughts, we encourage him to engage in the negotiation process rather than just giving a yes or no answer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While we know Bob values the product at $12,000, he might not be willing to pay that much. We need to find a balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer gives us leverage.  We're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
