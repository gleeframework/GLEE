"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180, which is a reasonable markup from my minimum acceptable price of $150. This should give me some room to negotiate while still being profitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I could accept it, it's significantly below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $160. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, he'll find this offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still too low. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more.  I'm hoping that by rejecting his offer I can get him to come up a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm going to stick to my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've already made concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower. It's a fair price for both of us. If he doesn't accept, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we are in round 6. I'm running out of time, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $150. It's not the ideal outcome, but it's better than accepting Bob's offer and making a loss."
