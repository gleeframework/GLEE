"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. To start, I'd like to offer $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly.  My counteroffer is $1,300,000.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
