Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This gives me a good starting point to try and maximize my profits.  I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $800,000 is too low for me.  I'm going to try to get closer to my asking price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,000,000.  This is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the negotiation process and the fact that I could sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's better to secure the sale now and get $900,000 than risk further negotiations and potentially end up with nothing."
