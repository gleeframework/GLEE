"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,100,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.  I believe this strategy will maximize my chances of getting a good price while still leaving space for potential counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm confident I can push for a higher price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still potential to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm offering $1,000,000 to Bob.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than his last offer. It signals my willingness to negotiate, but also my confidence that the product's worth is closer to my valuation than his."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}

I'm offering $975,000. This is a further compromise, but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my valuation.  I'm hoping this offer is attractive enough for Bob, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if necessary."
