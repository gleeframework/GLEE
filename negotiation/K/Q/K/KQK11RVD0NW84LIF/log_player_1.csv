Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're getting more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob is willing to pay $100, so he has room to negotiate. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This opens the door for a back-and-forth that could lead to a price you're both happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum ($80), it's still worth pushing for a higher price.  You can potentially get closer to your desired $95 by countering.  You're also not too far from your minimum, so you can afford to risk a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price.  I'm willing to come down to $90, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it. I would like to counter with a price of $87. I hope this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  $87 is only $7 away from your minimum of $80.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could try to counter again, the risk is that Bob could walk away and you'd be left with the $80 offer from John. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate might take more time and energy, and $87 is a solid price."
