"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you outlining the product's value.  However,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,275,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, taking into account both our positions.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
