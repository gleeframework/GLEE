"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than I can go right now. How about we split the difference at $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable asset. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $950,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000 â€“ that's my absolute minimum. This is a fair price, considering the value of this product. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to get as close as possible to your minimum, but I'm still a bit shy of that. How about we meet at $920,000?",920000.0,Bob,6,
