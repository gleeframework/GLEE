"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your perspective, $9,500 is significantly below its true value. To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $11,000. This feels like a reasonable compromise, doesn't it? ",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,800. I think that's a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",10800.0,Bob,4,
