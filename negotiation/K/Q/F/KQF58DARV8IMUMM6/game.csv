"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I really like the product, but I have a budget constraint and I'm trying to be as frugal as possible.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000. That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your persistence.  $13500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $14500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great deal for you.  Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",14000.0,Bob,6,
