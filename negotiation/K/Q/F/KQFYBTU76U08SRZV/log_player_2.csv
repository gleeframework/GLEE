"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset for a price that's well below its true worth to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $1,400,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This would still leave you a significant profit margin and allow us both to walk away happy. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

You're still in a good position. You've shown Alice you're serious about getting a good deal, and she's already come down from her initial price. By rejecting this offer, you can try to push for a price closer to your initial counteroffer of $1,200,000."
