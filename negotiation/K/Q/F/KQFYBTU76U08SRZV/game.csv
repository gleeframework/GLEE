"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000. This product is valuable to me, but that figure is more in line with my budget. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need a price closer to my initial offer. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This would still leave you a significant profit margin and allow us both to walk away happy.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing you a profit and me a good deal. What do you say?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
