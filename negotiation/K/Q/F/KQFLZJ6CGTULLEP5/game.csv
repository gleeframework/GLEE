"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate it. While it's a good price, I'm looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500? That's still a good deal for you and it gets me closer to my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,500 is a bit above your budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target. Would you consider $10,750? It's a fair price for both of us, and would allow me to purchase the product without overextending my budget.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $10,750. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $11,250. It's a compromise that still benefits both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11250.0,Alice,5,
