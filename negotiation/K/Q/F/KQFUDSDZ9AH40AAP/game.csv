"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at $10,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
