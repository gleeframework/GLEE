"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $9,500? It's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
