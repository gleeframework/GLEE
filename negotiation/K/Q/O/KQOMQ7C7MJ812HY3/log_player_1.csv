{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than the minimum I'd accept ($12,000), but I'm hoping to get closer to the $13,000 mark, which is what the product is worth to Bob. If he rejects this offer, I can always counter-offer or move on to John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe I can't pay more than $12,000 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by playing a long game.  It's better to secure the deal now and move on."
