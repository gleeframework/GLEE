Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible while ensuring the deal is still attractive to him.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $925,000 leaves some room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and there's a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price above the $800,000 backup offer.
* **Strong Initial Impression:**  The message emphasizes the product's value specifically to Bob, justifying the high price and increasing the likelihood of a successful negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Alice is comfortable with some risk. There's a chance Bob rejects the offer, and Alice will have to settle for John's $800,000 offer."
