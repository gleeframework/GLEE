"Hi Alice, $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $90 at this point.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $90 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal.",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $100, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to offer $95.  Let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I need to be closer to my desired price.  How about $97?  That's only $2 more than your offer, and it's a fair compromise.",97.0,Alice,5,
