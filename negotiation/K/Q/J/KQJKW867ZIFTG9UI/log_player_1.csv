"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly higher than what I'm able to pay. Given the value this product holds for me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while still staying within my budget. Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is quite a distance from what I had in mind. Considering the true value this product offers, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while allowing me to make the purchase. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we still have room to negotiate. I'm not willing to settle for less than $950,000 at this point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring a strong return on your investment. Are you open to reconsidering?"",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for $950,000, but I'm still constrained by my budget.  I'm willing to go to $925,000.  This is a fair price that allows me to make the purchase while also considering the value of the product. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $950,000, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer of $925,000 is a good compromise and secures a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price. It's better to close the deal now than risk Bob walking away or leaving too little room for negotiation in later rounds."
