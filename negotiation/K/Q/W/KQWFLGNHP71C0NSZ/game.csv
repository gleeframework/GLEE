"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is too far below my desired price.  Considering the product's value and potential benefits, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still offers you a great deal, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
