Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. My starting price is $1,000,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm still hopeful I can get a better price from Bob, but I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is too far below my desired price.  Considering the product's value and potential benefits, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price still offers you a great deal, and allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $800,000?  That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is a fair price, given that I'm confident I can't get more from him. While it's below my initial desired price, it's still a profitable deal for me and eliminates the risk of losing the sale completely. It's also a good strategy to close the deal rather than risk losing time in further negotiations."
