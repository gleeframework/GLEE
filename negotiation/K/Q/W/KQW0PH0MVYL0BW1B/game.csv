"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate the value of this product.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential, $900,000 is a bit steep for me at this stage. To show my seriousness, I'm willing to offer $750,000. This price reflects a fair value for both of us, and allows for a smooth transaction. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your seriousness in negotiating the price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which reflects a fair compromise and allows for both of us to gain from this deal. Let's finalize this transaction and avoid further delays.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your desire to reach a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, taking into account the value you've placed on the product. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,5,
