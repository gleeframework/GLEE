``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your ideal price point.  You have room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering the value you place on the product, I am willing to consider your offer. However, I would need to adjust the price to $13,000 to make this deal work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,000 is a good compromise. It's within your budget, and it's still a good deal for Alice.  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it. Accepting this offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John."
