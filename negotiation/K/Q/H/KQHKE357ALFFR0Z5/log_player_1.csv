{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 
 
I've chosen to start with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because:

* It's above my minimum acceptable price of $100, so I'm still making a profit.
* It's below Bob's perceived value of $120, leaving room for negotiation and potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* This price allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially adjust my offer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested but $115 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to go down to $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **Reject Bob's offer**. Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** While $105 is better than selling to John for $100, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay more than John, so I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and have some bargaining power. This could potentially lead to a higher counteroffer from Bob.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $105 is still a little too low for me.  How about $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm offering $110 to Bob. This price is:

* **Still profitable for me:** It's above my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **A compromise:** It's a middle ground between my initial offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $105.
* **A reasonable offer:**  I believe $110 is a fair price considering the product's value to Bob."
