"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price and my own budget. This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still stay well below $800,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $600,000, I signal that I'm serious but also expect Alice to come down in price. 
* **Alternative Option:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to buy from John for $800,000. This helps me stay grounded and avoid overpaying."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposed price. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair offer considering its potential benefits for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Still Too High:** While Alice came down in price, $900,000 is still above my budget and very close to John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move on price suggests there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price. 
* **John as Backup:** I'm keeping the option to buy from John open as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I can do $700,000. That's a significant investment on my part and reflects the value I see in the product."", 
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm increasing my offer significantly to show Alice I'm serious but staying firmly below her current offer. This aims to find a compromise closer to the middle ground.
* **Justification:** I'm providing a brief reason for my counteroffer, emphasizing the investment aspect to appeal to Alice's sense of getting a fair deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is still within my budget while putting pressure on Alice. She needs to decide if she's willing to lose the sale or potentially negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the true value of this product. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to accept $850,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer. 
* **Above Budget:** $850,000 is still above both my budget and John's offer.
* **No Incentive to Negotiate:**  Given Alice's firm stance and the price difference, there's little incentive to continue negotiating. I'd be unlikely to secure a better price from Alice. 

It's time to take the guaranteed win and purchase from John."
