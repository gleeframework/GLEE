"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for something worth at least $150 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $125?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is better than Bob's initial value of $120, it's still below my minimum threshold of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $132.50?  It's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 132.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $132.50 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $130?  This would be a good middle ground, and we could finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum threshold of $150, but it's getting closer.  I've already rejected two of his offers, and it's possible he won't budge further.  Accepting his offer is the most sensible option at this point, as it's likely the best I can achieve given his negotiation style and the limited number of rounds remaining."
