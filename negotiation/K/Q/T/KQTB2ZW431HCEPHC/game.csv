"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider selling it for $9,000?  I think that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $9,750? That's a significant move on my end.",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $10,200. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",10200.0,Alice,5,
