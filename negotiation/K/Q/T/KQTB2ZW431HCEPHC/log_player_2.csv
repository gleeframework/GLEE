It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Alice is very slowly coming down, and we might be able to squeeze a slightly better price out of her.  However, the difference is now small enough that it's not worth the risk of her digging in and refusing to budge further.  John offers a guaranteed price that meets our needs."
