# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $600,000. Considering its worth to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go below $950,000, and we know we can get the product for $800,000 from John. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed deal from John."
