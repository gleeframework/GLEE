"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of my product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $600,000. Considering its worth to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to meet in the middle, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's worth to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
