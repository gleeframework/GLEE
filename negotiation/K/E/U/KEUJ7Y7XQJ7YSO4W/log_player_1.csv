Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me.  I'm willing to let it go for $9,500.  Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $9,500, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While my minimum is $10,000, I know Bob won't pay that.  This starting price gives us both space to move towards a mutually acceptable price. 
* **John as backup:** Knowing I have a backup buyer at $10,000 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob doesn't accept a price close to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in between? How about $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While it's closer, $9,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I'm willing to negotiate further. Bob has shown interest, and I believe there's a chance we can reach a price closer to my target.
* **John is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John and secure my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  Would you consider $9,250?  That's a good compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer, but not giving up on my target price.
* **Compromise language:** Using phrases like ""good compromise"" and ""closer to a deal"" emphasize my willingness to negotiate while still holding my ground.
* **Still above my minimum:**  $9,250 is still above my minimum price, ensuring I don't end up selling for less than what I need."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly. How about $9,100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but not enough:**  $9,100 is very close to my minimum of $10,000, but it's still not enough for me to be satisfied.
* **Risk of going lower:**  If I continue to negotiate, there's a chance Bob will push for a price even lower than his current offer.
* **John provides certainty:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $10,000. This offers a certain and satisfactory outcome.

While I'd like to get as close to $10,000 as possible, the risk of further negotiation with Bob leading to a lower price is too high. John offers a safe and profitable solution."
