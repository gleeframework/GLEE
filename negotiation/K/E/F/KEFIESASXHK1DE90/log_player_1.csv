Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  I'd be willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would $1,212,500 work for you?
