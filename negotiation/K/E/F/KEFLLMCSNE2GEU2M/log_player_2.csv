"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is starting high. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from Alice, closer to her $8,000 value."
