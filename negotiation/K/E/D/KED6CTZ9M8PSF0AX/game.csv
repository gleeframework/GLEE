"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16000. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $14000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in making a deal, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $14000. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to meet you in the middle. I'll sell it to you for $15500. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think it's worth considering.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $13500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Bob,6,
