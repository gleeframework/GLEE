Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit below my initial asking price, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1400000.

Round 7

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still higher than my ideal price. While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, I've already gone through several rounds and I'm concerned I might end up paying more than I'm comfortable with. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a safe and sure option at this point."
