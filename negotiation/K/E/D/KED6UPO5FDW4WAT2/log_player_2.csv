"Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:

It's not worth buying the product for $150 when you can get it from John for $120.  It's best to reject Alice's offer and make a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $100, which is still a good deal for me, and leaves room for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still a fair starting point."

Alice's offer is still too high.  I'm going to reject it and make another counteroffer."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $115. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but it's still below her current offer and closer to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:

Alice's offer is still higher than John's price. It's not worth risking another round of negotiation. I'll buy from John."
