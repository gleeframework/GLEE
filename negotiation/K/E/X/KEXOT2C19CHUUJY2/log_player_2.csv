"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to you ($1,200,000). You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I have a backup option from John. I believe we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go up to $1100000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1050000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price point, it's still above her stated value of $1,000,000.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still slightly above my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000, which is a fair compromise and closer to your value. I believe we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go up to $1075000 just yet. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you the product for $1060000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,060,000 is very close to your counteroffer of $1,075,000.  This is a good deal for you, as you are getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Accepting this offer saves you $140,000 compared to buying from John.  There is likely little room for further negotiation at this point."
