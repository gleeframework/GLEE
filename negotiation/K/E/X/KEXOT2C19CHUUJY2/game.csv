"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I have a backup option from John. I believe we can reach an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go up to $1100000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1050000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1050000 is still slightly above my comfort zone. I'm willing to pay $1075000, which is a fair compromise and closer to your value. I believe we can close the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go up to $1075000 just yet. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you the product for $1060000.
