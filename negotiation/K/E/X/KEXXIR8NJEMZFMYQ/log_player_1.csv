``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm offering a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $1,000,000. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I understand his budget constraint, accepting his offer would mean selling the product significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not willing to settle for a loss."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't come down to $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering you the product for $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
