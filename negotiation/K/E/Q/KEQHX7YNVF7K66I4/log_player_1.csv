Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the interest, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. Could you consider reducing the price to $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. However, I would like to stick to my initial budget. Would it be possible to reach an agreement at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90

Explanation:  Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his initial offer, which is well below your minimum. It's unlikely further negotiation will get you significantly closer to your target price.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable profit."
