Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $150 to me, I'll try to get as close to that as possible. I'll offer it to him for $140.

{""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","Bob's offer is lower than what I was hoping for, but it's still a decent offer. Since the product is worth $120 to Bob, I think he's making a reasonable offer. I'll decide to accept his offer.
