"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $9,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but still reflects the product's value to me. I'm confident I can get a good price, but I'm also prepared to walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}

I'm lowering my price slightly to $8,500. This is a good compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a profit."

While $7,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm not willing to give up yet, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit. Bob's offer of $7,500 is too low, and I'm not willing to risk further rounds. I've had a good negotiation with Bob, but it's time to cut my losses and take the sure $8,000 from John."
