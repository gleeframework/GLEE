Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $19,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to offer $12,000 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is significantly below my minimum.  The product offers a lot of value, and I need to get a fair price for it. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

$15,500 is still above Bob's budget.  He should continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value, but $15,500 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  To be honest, I was hoping to get closer to $15,000. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $14,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should continue to negotiate. While $14,250 is closer to his budget, he still has room to negotiate for a better price, especially since he can buy the product from John for $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go a little higher, but $14,250 is still outside my comfort zone. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,750? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13750}
