{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is above your minimum value but still within a range that Bob might be willing to accept, as it's less than the product's value to him. It also leaves room for negotiation should Bob counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'll reject it and make a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $1,150,000? This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and it's closer to your offer.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we meet in the middle at $1175000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,175,000 is still lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it's a compromise.  I'm going to accept his offer because it's close to my minimum and I don't want to risk losing him as a buyer. It's better to get something than risk getting nothing.  I can always try to get a better deal next time."
