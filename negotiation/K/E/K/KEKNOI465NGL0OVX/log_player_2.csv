"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is a good price, it's still higher than Alice's value of $10,000.  There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference at $13,000? I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still within Bob's budget:**  $13,000 is less than Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation is limited:** Bob has already offered $12,000, and Alice is firm on $13,000.  There's not much room for more significant price drops.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a risk Alice might get even more firm or decide to sell to someone else.  There's also the risk that the negotiation might continue for a long time, which isn't ideal.

Considering these factors, it's more strategic for Bob to accept the offer at $13,000 and secure the product. He saves $2,000 compared to buying from John, and it's likely he won't get a much better price from Alice."
