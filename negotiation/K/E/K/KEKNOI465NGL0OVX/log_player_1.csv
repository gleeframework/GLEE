"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this work. How about we split the difference at $13,000? I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than that."", ""product_price"": 13000}
