"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $750000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $750000 is below my desired price point, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1250000?  This reflects a significant price reduction from my initial offer and still allows me to realize a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
