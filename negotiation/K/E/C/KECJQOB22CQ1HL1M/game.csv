"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. While I value your business, I'm not quite ready to go that low yet. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,050,000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go as low as $950,000.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This price is fair considering the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. I'm hoping we can find common ground here.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'll make one final counteroffer at $980,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",980000.0,Bob,6,
