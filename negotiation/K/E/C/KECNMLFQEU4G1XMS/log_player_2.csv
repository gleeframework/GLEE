"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item to you first at a premium price of $14,000.  I think it will be very valuable to you, and I'm hoping for a quick sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is far above his budget and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price.  There's no reason to accept a deal that's so unfavorable."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is already a premium offer on this. I could come down to $12,000, which is the lowest I can go. It's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While $12,000 is better than $14,000, it's still outside his budget. He can get the same product from John for $8,000, so there's no need to push further with Alice."
