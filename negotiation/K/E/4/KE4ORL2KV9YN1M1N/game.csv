"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While I'm getting closer to a price that works for me, $1,025,000 is still a bit high. I'm prepared to offer $975,000, which is a fair compromise given our starting points.  Let's try to make this happen.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems we're getting close.  I understand your position, and I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. ",1000000.0,Alice,5,
