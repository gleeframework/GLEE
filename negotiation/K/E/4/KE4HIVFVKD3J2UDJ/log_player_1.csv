""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. This offer reflects the true worth of the product in the current market."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is significantly higher than I had budgeted for.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  We have plenty of room to negotiate and John provides a good safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial proposal. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the product's value. However, the price gap between your offer and my budget remains substantial. I can go up to $700,000, but that's the maximum I'm willing to spend at this time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob is still very far below our minimum. We'll continue negotiating, but it's good to keep John in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's bridge the gap.  I'm proposing $1,600,000.  This is a significant reduction on my part and reflects my desire to see this product in your capable hands."",
""product_price"": 1600000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your movement, but the price is still too high for me.  To be frank, I'm prepared to walk away at anything over $800,000. If you're able to come down significantly, I'm still interested, but otherwise, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Bob has now revealed his maximum price, and it's significantly lower than our minimum.  There's no point in continuing the negotiation as we'll never reach a mutually agreeable price. Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price."
