"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $80. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be an excellent addition to your collection. Would you like to make this purchase today? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's product might be great, her opening offer is your maximum budget. There's no benefit to accepting immediately. By rejecting, you might:

* **Prompt a better offer:** Alice might be willing to negotiate, especially since she values the product at the same price you're willing to pay. 
* **Establish your price:** Rejecting tells Alice you're a serious buyer but not willing to overpay.  

You're not losing anything by rejecting at this point since you have John as a backup."
