"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $850,000 isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves some room for both of us to be happy.  Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $875,000 simply doesn't work for me.  Let's try $890,000. This is a fair compromise and allows us both to close this deal.",890000.0,Alice,5,
