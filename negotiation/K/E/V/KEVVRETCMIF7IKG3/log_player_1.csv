"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still within a range that might be attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate further. However, I'll always keep the option of selling to John for $150 in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $170 is a bit steep for me. How about $130?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $155.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 155}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested but $155 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $145?  I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $145 is still a bit lower than my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum. Given that I'm already in round 4, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale, and it's better than selling to John for $150."
