,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,000 at this time. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me. While $17,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $12,000.  My absolute bottom line is $14,000.  Take it or leave it.",14000.0,Alice,5,
