You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000

$20,000 is far above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before going to John."

Alice's offer:

You have three options:

$17,000 is still over your budget, but closer to your max.  Let's try one more counteroffer before going to John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate you working with me. While $17,000 is closer, it's still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $12,000.  My absolute bottom line is $14,000.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above your budget, and you've already made a counteroffer that was rejected. It's better to stick to your goal of saving money and buy from John for $8,000."
