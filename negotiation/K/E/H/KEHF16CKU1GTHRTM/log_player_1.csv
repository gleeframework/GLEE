Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
