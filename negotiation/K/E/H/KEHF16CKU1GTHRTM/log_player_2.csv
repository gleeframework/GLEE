"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to work with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $800,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $800,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a reasonable profit margin for both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating our pricing strategy, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're offering the product to you for $750,000. This price takes into account your concerns while still reflecting the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price.**  $750,000 is a significant improvement from the initial $800,000. 
* **There's a risk of further negotiation.** If Bob rejects the offer, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. She might even increase the price again.
* **John's offer is a safety net.**  Bob can always purchase from John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Alice falls apart. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting the offer at $750,000 is the best choice.  It's a good price, and Bob can avoid the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a worse outcome."
