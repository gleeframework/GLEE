"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product that I believe you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more along the lines of $15000. Could you meet me at that price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 is a bit steep for you, but $15000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $18000. Is that something you'd be interested in?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16500. Could you consider that price?",16500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to come down to $17500, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",17500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $16000. Could you consider that price?",16000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting stuck in a loop. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, but I need to make a profit, so I'm going to throw in a small concession: I'll include a one-year warranty on the product, which is a $1000 value. So, the total price is effectively $17000. Is that a deal you'd be willing to accept?",17000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the added value of the one-year warranty, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, and I'm willing to consider the warranty as part of the deal. Can you consider that price?",16000.0,Bob,8,
