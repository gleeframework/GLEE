I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $65 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price of $80."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $65 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is closer to my minimum price, I'm still not comfortable with it. I'm hoping we can find a price that's more equitable for both of us."
