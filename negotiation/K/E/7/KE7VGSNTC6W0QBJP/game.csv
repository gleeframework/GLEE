"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $65 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  That's still a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm open to finding a solution, but $75 is still a bit too low for me. How about we settle for $80?  That's my absolute minimum, and it would allow us both to walk away happy with the deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
