"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I think it's a price that's fair for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $13,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive message can encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as fair to both of us, hoping to avoid an immediate rejection.

**Note:** I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if negotiations don't go well.  This gives me leverage and a clear point at which I'll likely stop negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** I have the option of selling to John for $15,000, so I don't need to settle for a price that's significantly lower than that.  
* **Room for Counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my minimum.

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, aiming to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $11,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives us both room to be happy with the deal.  Let's work together to find a solution."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer but not going all the way. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to justify my counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone to encourage further discussion. 

**Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price. This approach helps maintain leverage and encourages Bob to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd like to make a new offer of $10500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm not desperate to sell, and I have the option of selling to John for a much higher price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe I can still convince Bob to move closer to my desired price range with further negotiation.

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I will counter with a price higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my previous offer, aiming for a compromise. I will emphasize the value of the product and highlight the benefits of reaching an agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $10,500 is still too far off from what I need.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,500. This offer acknowledges your perspective while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us, and I'm eager to reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm showing flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer but leaving some room for negotiation.  
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing that this offer benefits both of us and encourages a positive response. 
* **Addressing Concerns:** I'm acknowledging Bob's concerns about the price and highlighting my willingness to find a solution. 

**Strategy:**  I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might accept, but still above his last offer.  I'm staying positive and making it clear that I'm willing to negotiate further, but I also have the option to sell to John for a higher price, which gives me leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new offer of $10800. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds left, I need to be strategic about maximizing my potential earnings. 
* **Potential for Higher Counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired price range. 

**Next Steps:** In the next round, I will counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, but still below my minimum. I will continue to emphasize the value of the product and highlight the benefits of reaching an agreement."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I understand your perspective on the price, but $10,800 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,200?  It's a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 11200}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm using language like ""split the difference"" and ""walk away happy"" to create a positive and collaborative tone. 
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly emphasizing the importance of closing the deal by saying ""Let's close this deal and move forward."" This might motivate Bob to accept the offer.

**Strategy:** I'm aiming for a quick resolution in this round. My offer is still slightly above my minimum, but it's a strong compromise. With only three rounds left, I'm looking to close the deal or move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a new offer of $10900. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:** We're down to two rounds left, and Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Time is Money:** With each round, I'm losing time and potentially money if I can't reach a deal.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is well above my minimum acceptable price and  what I can likely achieve with Bob.

**Conclusion:**  While I'm not thrilled about selling to John, it's the most sensible option given the limited time and the fact that Bob's offers are still significantly below my desired price point."
