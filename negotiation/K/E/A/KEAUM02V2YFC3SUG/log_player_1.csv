"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing that I have a backup option with John for $8,000. This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if needed. I'm also trying to be positive and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I can only pay up to $8500. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm still hoping to get a better price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000 by continuing the negotiation. While $8,500 is better than John's offer, it's still not where I want to be, and I have time to try and improve the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,250, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm trying to be reasonable by meeting Bob halfway in this round. $9,250 is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer, and I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also highlights that the product is worth more than what he's offered."
