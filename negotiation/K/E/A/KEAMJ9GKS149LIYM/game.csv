"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
