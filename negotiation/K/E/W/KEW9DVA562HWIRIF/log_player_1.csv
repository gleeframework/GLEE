"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to create room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** While $17,000 is a good price for me, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving space for negotiation.
* **Positive and open tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel comfortable engaging in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm not willing to sell at that price, even though it's above his perceived value. I have 9 more rounds and the option to sell to John, so I'll continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth that investment."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-offering:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not giving up. I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price while still acknowledging his willingness to negotiate.
* **Moving towards the middle:** I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between our initial offers. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value to encourage him to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $14,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  How about $12,000? I'm serious about buying the product, and that's a fair price considering it's closer to my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell at that price. I have several rounds left and I can always sell to John for $15,000. I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $12,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you consider $13,000? That's a significant compromise on my part, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:** I'm still not willing to sell at Bob's offer, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise further.
* **Meeting Halfway (Again):** I'm again suggesting a price that's halfway between our previous offers. This signals flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Enthusiasm:** I'm expressing enthusiasm to encourage Bob to accept and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle on $12,500? That's a fair middle ground, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price.  I have 4 rounds remaining and I can always sell to John for $15,000.  I'll continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a little below my target.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,250.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both of our needs.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small but Significant Increase:**  I'm proposing a small increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise but still have room to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the ""middle ground"" aspect of the proposed price, making it sound like a fair solution for both of us.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  I'm adding a bit of urgency by saying ""what do you say?"" to encourage Bob to close the deal."
