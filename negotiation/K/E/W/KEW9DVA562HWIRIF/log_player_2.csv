Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth that investment.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $12,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you consider $13,000? That's a significant compromise on my part, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is still a little below my target.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,250.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges both of our needs.  What do you say?

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to go down to a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  While we could continue negotiating, it's getting risky. It's better to cut our losses and go with the guaranteed good deal from John."
