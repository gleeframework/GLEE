"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I can meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting close to your target, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $990,000, which is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I need to know if it's a deal-breaker for you.",990000.0,Alice,5,
