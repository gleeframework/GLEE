"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,800,000 price point. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $1,500,000? I believe this is closer to the value you're seeking while still allowing me to stay within my financial limits.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,500,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still constrained by my budget. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $1,400,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise considering both our interests.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
