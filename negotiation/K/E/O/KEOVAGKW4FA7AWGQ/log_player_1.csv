Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation, but still above Bob's perceived value. It also shows you're open to compromise, which is important in establishing a positive negotiation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is more than Bob's perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $150. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $130 is still below my minimum desired price of $150, it's a reasonable compromise. It's closer to my desired price than John's offer, and it ensures a sale without further negotiation."
