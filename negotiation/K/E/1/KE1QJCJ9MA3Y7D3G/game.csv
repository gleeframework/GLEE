"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $170 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $80.  Would that work for you?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  $80 is quite low, but I'm willing to come down to $140.  I believe this product is worth it, and I'm sure you'll get a lot of use out of it.",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While it's a nice product, $140 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $95? That's the highest I can go.",95.0,Bob,4,
