"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, aiming to get as close to my minimum as possible. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving a decent profit margin for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly but still maintaining a good profit margin. This shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but also willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,350,000 is tempting, I'm still within my minimum threshold and believe I can get a slightly higher price.  I'll counteroffer once more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to meet him halfway.  This should make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too close to my minimum threshold and I'm starting to risk losing out on a better deal.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is more than I can get from Bob at this stage.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
