Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,200,000. I'm willing to part with it for $1,600,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **High starting point:** Since I know Bob values the product at $1,200,000, I start with a significantly higher offer of $1,600,000. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for the maximum profit. 
* **Scarcity & Urgency:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, making Bob more likely to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **John as a safety net:** I don't rely on John's offer as my starting point. While it guarantees $1,200,000, my goal is to maximize profit with Bob."
