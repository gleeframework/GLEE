Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would greatly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it at the special price of $20,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he can get you to come down on price. 
* **Justification:** Simply throwing out a high number isn't enough. By saying you're offering it ""before listing it publicly"" and highlighting the ""special price,"" you create a sense of value and urgency.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer is primarily about understanding how interested Bob is. If he flat out refuses, you haven't lost anything, as you have John as a backup. If he counter-offers, you know he's serious and can negotiate from there."
