Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm starting high, aiming for a profit of $500,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me a significant margin. I'm confident in the value of the product, but I'm also aware of the potential to sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,300,000 is better than selling to John, I still believe the product is worth more. I'm going to counteroffer and try to close the deal closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,400,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on the value of the product. I believe this is a fair price that will allow both of us to walk away happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal!  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob has come up to $1,350,000, which is a significant profit.  It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking a counteroffer from Bob that's lower or potentially selling to John for $1,000,000."
