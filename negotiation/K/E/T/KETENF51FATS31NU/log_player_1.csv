Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny of my asking price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation or a potentially higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state the product's value to Bob, it implies a high value by using phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant value."" This aims to make the price more palatable.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer primarily serves to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. If he rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John at your minimum acceptable price."
