"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is friendly and focuses on the potential benefit to Bob.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The question encourages Bob to respond and potentially counter-offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can get the product for a lower price elsewhere. I am willing to pay $9,500 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have several rounds left.
* **John as a Safety Net:** John's offer provides a solid backup if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal, how about it?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Reinforcing Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Closing Statement:** The message is direct and encourages a final decision from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe I can secure the product for less. I am willing to pay $9,500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a point where Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer of $9,500. 
* **Time Constraints:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of not getting a better offer is too high.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price of $12,000, eliminating any risk and ensuring a profitable outcome."
