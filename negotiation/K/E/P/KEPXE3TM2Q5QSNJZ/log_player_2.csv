Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $900000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price to reflect the true value of this product. How about $1000000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to meet my goals.  What do you say?
