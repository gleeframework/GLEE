Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,500,000.  I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000 to make this deal work. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and reflects the value I see in working with you."", ""product_price"": 1750000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1750000, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. Can you consider that?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to make another counteroffer in the next round, hoping to reach a mutually beneficial price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware that time is running out. With only 4 rounds left, it's not likely we'll reach an agreement. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000 to ensure I get a fair price."
