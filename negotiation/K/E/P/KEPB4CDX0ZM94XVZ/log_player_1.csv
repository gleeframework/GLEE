Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's uniqueness. However, $20000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13000 for it, given my maximum budget and the potential for negotiating a fair price. What do you think?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
