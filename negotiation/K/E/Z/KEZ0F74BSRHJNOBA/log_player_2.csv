"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, you can likely get it for less. You have a significant buffer between your maximum price ($1,500,000) and Alice's offer. Negotiating further could potentially save you a considerable amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's offer of $900,000, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping Alice will be willing to meet me halfway, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is higher than my initial offer of $750,000, but still lower than her original offer of $900,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating as there's still room to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $850,000.  This is a compromise between Alice's last offer of $950,000 and my previous offer of $750,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still looking for a good deal.  I believe this is a fair price that both of us can agree to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $975,000 is very close to my maximum price of $1,500,000. While it's possible we could negotiate further, I don't want to risk getting into a bidding war and potentially paying a price I'm not comfortable with.  It's better to secure the product now from John at a known and reasonable price."
