"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to make a smart investment. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's start the negotiation. Alice's first offer is way above my budget. I'll try to bring the price down significantly in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $500,000."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a low offer to gauge Alice's reaction.  There's a chance she'll find it unreasonable, but it's a starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $500,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $900,000. Let me know if this is more to your liking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $900,000 is still too high. I'll hold firm for now and see if I can get her closer to my budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch. I'm willing to increase my offer to $600,000. I believe that's a fair price, considering the market value."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

I'm raising my offer, but I'm keeping it below John's price.  Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $600,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering $1,000,000. This is my best and final offer for now, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but $1,000,000 is still too far from my budget. Her saying ""best and final"" might be a negotiating tactic. I'll counter with a smaller increase to see if she's truly firm or if there's more room to move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, and I'm glad we're getting closer. While $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. I hope this demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer by a smaller amount to test Alice's resolve. By expressing my commitment to the deal, I'm hoping to signal that I'm willing to negotiate further but also getting close to my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $650,000 is still not enough for me to meet my minimum. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at a price that's closer to my target. I'm counteroffering $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

It seems like Alice is not budging much, and her ""final offer"" is still significantly higher than John's price. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at a price I'm comfortable with."
