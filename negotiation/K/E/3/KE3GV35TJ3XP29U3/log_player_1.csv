"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. My initial price is $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's value but below my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully incentivizes Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is getting closer to Bob's value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $120. I'm going to keep pushing for a better price.  We've got rounds to go, and I'm not ready to give up yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $85 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a fair price, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $82.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I'm still not willing to accept a price this low.  I need to keep pushing Bob to see if I can get him to budge.  I'm going to counteroffer again and see where this goes.  We still have several rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to run out of patience here.  $82.50 is still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $90, but that's my final offer.  If you're truly interested in this product, you need to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still very interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $82. This is my final offer. Can you accept it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached the point where Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price, and I've already made several concessions. I've also warned Bob that I'm running out of patience. 

It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. It's better to guarantee a profit of $120 than risk getting a lower price from Bob, especially as we're running out of rounds."
