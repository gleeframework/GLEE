Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This is a good starting point.  It's a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for Bob to potentially counteroffer and get a better deal than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$120 is still a good price, but I can likely get more by countering.  I'll see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 
I'm going to counter with $130. This is still a good deal for Bob, but it gets me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now pretty close to my minimum, and I'm worried that if I reject and counteroffer, he might just walk away and I'd be stuck with John's offer. I'm going to accept and secure the sale."
