I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob."

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

```

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob.  $106 is only $2 less than my last offer, and it's still better than selling to John.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
