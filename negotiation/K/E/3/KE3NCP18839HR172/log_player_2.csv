"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason: Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($120) and John's offer ($120). There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your ideal price. This leaves room for counteroffers and compromise.
* **Respectful but Firm:** The message acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating your price limit.  
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer gauges Alice's flexibility. If she's completely unwilling to negotiate down from $180, you know you can always go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $140 is better than her initial price, it's still above your maximum budget of $120 and John's offer. There's still room for negotiation to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $140 is still a bit more than I had in mind.  Could you do $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's price while still staying under your budget. It aims to find a compromise.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $110 is closer to your goal, offering a bit above your absolute limit ($120) allows some wiggle room if Alice makes another counteroffer.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message keeps the tone polite and straightforward, focusing on the price negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $130. It's a great product, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm at $130, which is still above your $120 budget and John's offer.  Further negotiation is unlikely to close the gap significantly.  At this point, it's more cost-effective to go with John's guaranteed price of $120."
