"I'm interested in the product, but $1750000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point. However, $1400000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while ensuring you get a fair deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1450000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm hoping we can get even closer to my target.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still a bit hesitant at $1450000.  It's getting closer, but I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $1550000? This is my absolute lowest price point, but I'm hoping we can close this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
