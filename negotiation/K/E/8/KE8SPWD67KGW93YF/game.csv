"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,300,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, reflecting its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the product's value is significantly higher than that.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This reflects the product's value to me while staying within my budget. Let's work towards a mutually agreeable solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,
