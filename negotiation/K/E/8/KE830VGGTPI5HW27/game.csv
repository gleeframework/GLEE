"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11,250? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to where I need to be. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice.  While $11,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $10,750? It's a fair compromise, I think.",10750.0,Bob,4,
