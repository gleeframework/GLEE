"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I need a price that makes sense. How about $800,000?"",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price.** This shows Alice that we're serious about getting a good deal and willing to negotiate. 
* **It's still within a range that could be profitable for Alice.**  She wants to make a profit, but there's a good chance she'll accept something above her base value of $1,500,000.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation.**  We've set a starting point, and Alice can now counter with a price closer to her target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This price reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice came down significantly, $1,900,000 is still way above our budget and what we know we can get it for from John. It's time to push back harder."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,900,000 is still far beyond what I'm willing to pay.  I'm serious about buying this product, but I have a budget I need to stick to. If you're willing to come down to $1,100,000, we might have a deal."",

**Strategy:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're acknowledging her concessions but standing our ground. This shows we're not going to be pushed around.
* **Target Above John's Price:** We're aiming slightly above our ""walk-away"" price to give us some room to negotiate further if needed.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By suggesting we ""might have a deal,"" we imply this is a serious offer she should consider carefully."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I understand you have a budget.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  My final offer is $1,400,000.  This is a significant investment for you, but I truly believe in the value this product will bring.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to go much lower:** She's stated this is her ""final offer,"" and it's still significantly above her $1,500,000 valuation.
* **We have a guaranteed option:**  John offers the product at $1,000,000, saving us $400,000 compared to Alice's final offer. 
* **Time is a factor:**  Every round of negotiation takes time, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. 

It's time to cut our losses and secure the product at the best possible price from John."
