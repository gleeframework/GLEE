Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal.  Since I don't know Bob's value, I'm aiming for a price that's high but not overly unrealistic. If Bob rejects, we'll see what counteroffer he gives and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet.  I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer but still higher than Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price that shows I'm willing to compromise while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $11,000. This is a good price, considering my minimum is $10,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to my original asking price, the risk of further negotiation could lead to a lower offer or even Bob walking away.  Accepting his offer ensures I get a good price and secure the sale."
