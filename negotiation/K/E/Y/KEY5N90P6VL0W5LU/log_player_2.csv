"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's significantly lower than that. I'm confident we can come to an agreement that benefits us both. Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to negotiate a price higher than her product's worth to her ($800,000). 
* While her offer is less than your maximum budget ($1,000,000), you can likely get a better price.
* Rejecting her offer opens the door for further negotiation or allows you to buy from John at a lower price."
