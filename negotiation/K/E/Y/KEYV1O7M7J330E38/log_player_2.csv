"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $130. I think it's a great deal for you, what do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a better price than John's $150, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $130 to $115, which is a significant move.  At this price, Bob is getting a good deal, saving $35 compared to John's offer. There is likely less room for further negotiation, and the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer or Bob not being able to secure the product at all is high.  Accepting the offer is the best course of action to maximize savings and ensure Bob gets the product."
