"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum value of $80. I'm hoping Bob will find this offer attractive and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is more than my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise that shows good faith while still allowing for some profit. I believe this price is reasonable for both of us, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 98}
```

I'm going to counter with $98.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince him to close the deal. We're getting close to the halfway point in our negotiation rounds, so I want to start narrowing the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although $88 is just $8 away from my minimum, I'm not giving up yet.  I believe I can still get a slightly better price from Bob.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if he'll come up just a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 93} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $93. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer.  With only 3 rounds left, I need to be realistic about my chances of getting a higher price, but I still want to maximize my profit.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm concerned that I won't be able to get a significantly better offer from Bob.  Selling to John for $80 is a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum price.  I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John."
