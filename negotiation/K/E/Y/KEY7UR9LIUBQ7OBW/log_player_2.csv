# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $9,000, which reflects its worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,000 is under your $10,000 limit, you can do better. By rejecting this offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or proceed to buy from John for $10,000."
