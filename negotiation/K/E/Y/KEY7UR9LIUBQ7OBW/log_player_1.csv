Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $9,000, which reflects its worth and potential."", 
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($10,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $9,000 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he wishes, potentially leading to a slightly higher sale price.
* **Secure a Good Deal:**  Even if Bob rejects the offer, selling to John at $8,000 guarantees a decent profit margin."
