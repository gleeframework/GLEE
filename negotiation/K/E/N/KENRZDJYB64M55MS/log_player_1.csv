Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $15,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  If the price is set too close to $15,000, Bob might be turned off or feel like there's no room for negotiation.  Setting it lower increases the chance of a successful sale.
* **Backup Option:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 provides a safety net.  Alice won't risk losing money if Bob rejects the offer."
