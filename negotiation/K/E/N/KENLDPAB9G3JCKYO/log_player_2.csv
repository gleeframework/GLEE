"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $100 and Alice's initial offer is $100, it makes sense to buy from John. There's no potential for a better price by negotiating with Alice."
