"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is a good deal for Bob.  He can save $100,000 compared to buying from John.  While he could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee that he can get a better deal. Accepting her offer is the most logical choice."
