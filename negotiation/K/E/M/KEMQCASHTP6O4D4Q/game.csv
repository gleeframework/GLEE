"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $550,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. How about we settle around $650,000?  I feel that's a fair compromise.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its worth to me is $1,500,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,5,
