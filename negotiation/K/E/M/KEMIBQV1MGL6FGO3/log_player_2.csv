"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

While $120 is less than your $150 maximum, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is starting quite high above her own valuation of the product."
