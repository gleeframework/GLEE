"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. My starting price is $140.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, it's still above your target of $150.  There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $125?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal and establishes a starting point for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Justification:** My message provides a reason for my lower offer (""hoping to get it for a bit less""). This makes it seem less like a random number and more like a reasoned proposition. 
* **Keeping Options Open:**  I'm asking Alice for her thoughts, keeping the negotiation open."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low right now. How about we meet in the middle at $132.50? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $132.50 is still above my target of $150.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $132.50 is still a bit high for me.  How about $130?  I'm really interested in the product and believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm only moving up a small amount from my previous offer to show I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal.
* **Reiteration of Interest:** I emphasize my interest in the product to show Alice that closing this deal is a priority for me.
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  Again, I mention fairness to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and potentially move her closer to my desired price."
