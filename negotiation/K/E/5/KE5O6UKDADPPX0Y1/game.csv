"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $11,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price given its value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than what you'd be willing to pay. Let's meet in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,3,
