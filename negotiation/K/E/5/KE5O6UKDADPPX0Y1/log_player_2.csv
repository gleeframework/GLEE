"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price point.  It's better to reject and counteroffer, or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $11,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  This is a fair price given its value to me, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good deal for you, as it's significantly less than what you'd be willing to pay. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $10,500, which is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.
*  John is offering the product for $10,000, which is within Bob's budget.
* It's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John and save $500."
