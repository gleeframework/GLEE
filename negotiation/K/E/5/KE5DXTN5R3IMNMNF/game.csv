"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $2,300,000 is quite steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 as a starting point for further discussion.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. To be fair to both of us, I propose we meet in the middle at $1,850,000. This reflects the product's real value and ensures a mutually beneficial agreement.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, considering the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart. I've done a thorough analysis of the product's value, and I need to be realistic about its worth. I can come down to $1,600,000.  This price reflects a significant concession on my part while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still pushing my limits. To move this forward, I can offer $1,100,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, to be completely transparent, I need to get at least $1,400,000 for this product.  This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
