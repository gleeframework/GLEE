"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting high, you ""anchor"" the negotiation at a higher point. Even if the initial offer is rejected, it sets a reference point that may make subsequent offers seem more reasonable to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Concessions:** The significant gap between your starting price and your minimum acceptable price allows you to make concessions throughout the negotiation while still aiming for a highly profitable deal.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Remember, you have the option to walk away from the negotiation with Bob at any time and sell to John for your minimum price. This knowledge gives you leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $2,300,000 is quite steep for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 as a starting point for further discussion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, it's still early in the negotiation. There's room to explore if you can reach a better agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. To be fair to both of us, I propose we meet in the middle at $1,850,000. This reflects the product's real value and ensures a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** While still firm, you've made a substantial concession from your initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting in the Middle (Anchoring):**  Proposing a price almost exactly in the middle of your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer can be a persuasive negotiation tactic. It creates the impression of fairness and compromise.
* **Still Above Your Minimum:** The new price is still significantly above your ""walk-away"" point ($1,500,000), leaving you room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Gauging Bob's Seriousness:** This counteroffer will help you better understand how serious Bob is about the purchase and if a deal within your acceptable range is achievable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,850,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, considering the potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price.  You have room to negotiate and should try to guide him closer to your target range. Selling to John is always an option, but it's worth seeing if a deal closer to your desired outcome is possible with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart. I've done a thorough analysis of the product's value, and I need to be realistic about its worth. I can come down to $1,600,000.  This price reflects a significant concession on my part while ensuring a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Trend:** You are continuing a downward trend in your offers, signaling to Bob that you are willing to negotiate. 
* **Smaller Concession:** This time, the price reduction is smaller than the previous round ($250,000 vs. $1,350,000), showing Bob that you are getting closer to your bottom line. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning a ""thorough analysis"" you are subtly reinforcing the value of the product and providing a reason for your price. 
* **Above Minimum:**  The offer remains significantly above your walk-away point, giving you room for further negotiation. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** As you progress through the rounds, you might consider making smaller concessions and using language that suggests time is a factor (e.g., ""This is a limited-time offer"")."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still pushing my limits. To move this forward, I can offer $1,100,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer, demonstrating my commitment to reaching an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer, but $1,100,000 is still below your minimum acceptable price. However, Bob's offer is getting closer to your target range. You are only $400,000 apart now, and there's still room for negotiation in the remaining rounds.  You can afford to be a bit more firm in your next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, to be completely transparent, I need to get at least $1,400,000 for this product.  This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** The language in this round is key. You're signaling that you're nearing your bottom line and are prepared to walk away if the offer isn't met.
* **""Final Offer"":** While you might still be open to slight adjustments, stating it's your final offer creates a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Transparency and Justification:** You're giving Bob a clear reason for your price (""need to get at least""). Transparency can build trust, even in a negotiation. 
* **Limited Time:** You're subtly reminding Bob that you have other options (selling to John) without resorting to direct threats. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  The price is still a concession from your previous offer, but a much smaller one.  This shows you are serious but open to closing the deal."
