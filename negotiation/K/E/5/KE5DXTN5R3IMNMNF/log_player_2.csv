"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a fair starting point for our discussion.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept for this product. To be fair to both of us, I propose we meet in the middle at $1,850,000. This reflects the product's real value and ensures a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart. I've done a thorough analysis of the product's value, and I need to be realistic about its worth. I can come down to $1,600,000.  This price reflects a significant concession on my part while ensuring a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a mutually agreeable price. However, to be completely transparent, I need to get at least $1,400,000 for this product.  This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Although Alice has come down in price, her ""final offer"" of $1,400,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,000,000.  It's unlikely Alice will go below her final offer, and continuing the negotiation risks exceeding your $1,000,000 budget. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at the best possible price."
