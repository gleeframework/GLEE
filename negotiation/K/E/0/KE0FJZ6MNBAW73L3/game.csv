"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,050,000 to you. Considering your willingness to meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $1,075,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,075,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Would you consider $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $1,060,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1060000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, but $1,060,000 is still pushing it. My final offer is $1,040,000. Let me know if that works for you.",1040000.0,Bob,6,
