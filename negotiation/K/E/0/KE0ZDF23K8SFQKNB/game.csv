"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Given my budget, I'm willing to offer $11,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value this product brings.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While I see the value in the product, $12,500 is still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference again - I'm willing to offer $11,750.  I truly believe this price is fair, and I'm eager to finalize the purchase.",11750.0,Bob,4,
