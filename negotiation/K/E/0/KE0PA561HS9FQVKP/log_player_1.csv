Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it has even greater potential for your company. My starting price is $1,250,000.  I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still achieve a good profit. 
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob, suggesting it's even more valuable to him than it is to me. This can motivate him to pay a higher price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation, which can make Bob more willing to engage. 
* **Plan B:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is above John's offer of $1,000,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my initial offer of $1,250,000, aiming for a middle ground.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John at $1,000,000 would be a loss for me, and I'm determined to get closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial proposal, aiming to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product to both of us.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,175,000? This price is fair and allows both of us to achieve a positive outcome."", ""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer ($1,250,000) and Bob's offer ($1,100,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a solution.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is beneficial for both of us, ensuring a positive outcome for both parties.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm willing to lower my price, I'm still aiming for a figure that's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your latest one. How about we settle at $1150000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he'll come up further. I could end up in a stalemate or forced to sell to John at a lower price.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time, and I'm aiming for a quick resolution.

**Final Thoughts:**

While $1,150,000 is not my ideal price, it's a good deal considering the potential for a drawn-out negotiation and the risk of selling to John at a lower price."
