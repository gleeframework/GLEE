"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $150 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can meet you in the middle at $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go to $95 yet. I can do $105, which is a bit closer to my minimum price. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $105 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $100, which is a fair compromise. Let's seal the deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not getting any younger, Bob, and I'd like to wrap this up soon. I can do $110, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're really interested, let's meet at $110.",110.0,Alice,7,
