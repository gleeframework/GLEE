"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference again and go with $9,250? It's a fair compromise, and we can close this deal.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going above $8,800. Would you be willing to consider that? I'm willing to compromise further to get this deal done.",8800.0,Bob,6,
