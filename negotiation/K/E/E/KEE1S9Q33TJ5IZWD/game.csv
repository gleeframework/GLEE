"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to let it go for $25000.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $18000. Can you consider this price?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to pay $18000, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there. I'm willing to compromise, so I'll counteroffer at $22000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $22000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $20500. Can you consider this price?",20500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $21500. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",21500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about making a profit, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $21500. I'm willing to go up to $20750. Can you meet me at this price?",20750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $20750. I'll counteroffer at $21200. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",21200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that this is your final concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $21200. I'm willing to go up to $20900. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me at this price.",20900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made a significant concession, Bob, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'll meet you at $21000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm starting to think we're not going to come to an agreement, and I'm considering other options.",21000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $21000. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm going to have to walk away from this deal if we can't come to an agreement. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $19500. If not, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $15000.",19500.0,Bob,10,
