"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $18,000 is unfortunately out of my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $12,000 at this time. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it would be a good deal for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at $16,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to me. This offer is a good compromise and allows us both to reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer the product at $15,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a good compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,
