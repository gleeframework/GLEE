"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is above my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to leave room for negotiation but staying somewhat realistic. Let's see how Alice responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? It's still a great deal for such a valuable product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my budget, but I think there's still room for negotiation.  I'll try to bring the price down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $140 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

I'm inching closer to my limit but trying to remain appealing to Alice. This offer shows I'm willing to compromise but still want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $125 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - $132.50. That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting close, but I'm still aiming to get the price under $130. It's worth one more try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Alice.  How about $128?  That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 128
}
``` 

This offer is firm, but still a reasonable compromise. If Alice rejects it, I'll likely go with John to avoid the risk of the price going up again."
