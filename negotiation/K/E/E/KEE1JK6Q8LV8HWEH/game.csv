"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140? It's still a great deal for such a valuable product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $140 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $125 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - $132.50. That's a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Alice,5,

"You drive a hard bargain, Alice.  How about $128?  That's my final offer.",128.0,Bob,6,
