"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product I believe would be of great interest to you.  It's worth a significant amount to me, at least $1200000.  I'm confident it holds value for you as well. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth exploring if you can negotiate a lower price. There's no harm in rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer. You can start by gauging Alice's flexibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but your asking price is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By offering $800,000, you're establishing a lower starting point for negotiation. This shows Alice you're serious about buying, but also that you're not willing to pay her initial price.
* **Focus on Value:**  Mentioning the product being ""intriguing"" acknowledges its potential value to you without agreeing to her valuation.
* **Open to Compromise:** The phrase ""let's see if we can find common ground"" suggests you're open to further negotiation. This encourages Alice to respond and potentially come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While your offer is lower than I'd hoped,  I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1000000?  This price reflects the significant value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While you might try to squeeze out a slightly lower price, it's not worth risking losing the deal.  Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at your desired price.  Buying from John would cost the same, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice would result in a lower price."
