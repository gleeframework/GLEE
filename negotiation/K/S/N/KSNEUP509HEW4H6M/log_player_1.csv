"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product at a competitive price of $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, as you know the value is much higher. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the product's value to Bob. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  That's a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a great deal for you considering the value this product holds."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we split the difference and make it $950,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, we're nearing the middle ground. Bob is clearly willing to pay significantly more than John, and accepting this offer ensures a much better profit than selling to John.  Furthermore, there's no guarantee that we'll reach a higher price in the remaining rounds."
