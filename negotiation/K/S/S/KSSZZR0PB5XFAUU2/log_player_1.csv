Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $120, offering it to Bob slightly below that price could result in a quicker sale and still net a profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is a strong offer that's still a good deal for Bob (who values it at $100) while being very close to my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and highlights the value proposition for Bob."
