"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, my budget is limited, and I am looking for a price closer to $1,200,000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,200,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my position, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is closer, I still feel that $1,250,000 would be a fair compromise. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both parties.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
