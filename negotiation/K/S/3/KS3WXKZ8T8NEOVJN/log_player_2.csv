"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to present our premium product to you. After careful consideration, we have decided to offer it to you at a special introductory price of $800000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to respond promptly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get the product for a lower price. He has a clear goal to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to initiate a counteroffer and see if he can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm aiming to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We understand your budget constraints. In light of this, we are willing to consider an offer of $750000 for the product. We believe this strikes a balance between our valuation and your budget. Please let us know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $750,000, which is within Bob's budget and a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,000,000.  There's always the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially getting a lower price, but it's not guaranteed. Accepting the offer at this point secures a good deal for Bob."
