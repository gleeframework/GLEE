"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $12,000, you can still potentially get a better deal by counteroffering. You're willing to pay up to $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** I've started with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within the range where a deal is possible. This is a strong starting point for negotiation.
* **Reasonable offer:** $9,500 is still a profitable price for Alice, as it's higher than her $12,000 value.  
* **Open to negotiation:** The message leaves room for further negotiation, indicating that I'm willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is my final offer. If we can't agree on this, I might need to consider other options. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Price:** Alice's offer of $10,500 is still within your budget and slightly higher than John's offer of $10,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While you could potentially negotiate further, Alice has indicated this is her final offer and might consider other options.  
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product without taking the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer or potentially losing out on the deal altogether."
