Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I can't go lower than $1,300,000.  This reflects the significant value this product offers.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

While Bob's offer is a slight improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's settle on $1,287,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from the product, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1287500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1270000 for your product.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We are now at the sixth round, with Bob's offer still below my minimum acceptable price.  With limited rounds remaining, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This guarantees me a higher profit than I could achieve with Bob, and minimizes the risk of ending up with a lower price."
