This offer maximizes my potential profit while still being within the realm of what Bob is willing to pay. It's a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. Would you consider selling the product to me for $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to drop that low.  How about $975,000?  It's a fair compromise, and still a good deal for you. "", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your offer, but I am still unable to meet at $975,000. I would like to propose $960,000 for the product. This allows us to stay within a reasonable range while still giving me a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by being too stubborn.  $960,000 is a good compromise, and it's still a significant profit for me."
