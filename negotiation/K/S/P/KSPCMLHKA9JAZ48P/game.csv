"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $775,000 for the product. Can you consider this counteroffer?",775000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $775,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway at $812,500. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair negotiation. Let's work together to find a mutually agreeable solution.",812500.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose $792,500. Can you consider this revised counteroffer?",792500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower than my previous offer.  How about $800,000? This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth $800,000 to you.  It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
