"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's not even close to a fair starting point.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately far beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify paying that much.  To start, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value to me, and it leaves room for us to negotiate a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the inherent value of this product. While your offer is appealing, the price point doesn't reflect the true worth and potential return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant reduction and demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still way above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While she's reduced the price, it's not enough for me to accept.  It's clear that we are too far apart in our valuations.  At this point, it's more advantageous for me to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, ensuring I don't exceed my budget and get the product I need."
