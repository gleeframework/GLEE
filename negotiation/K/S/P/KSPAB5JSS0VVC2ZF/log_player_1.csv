Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is unfortunately far beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify paying that much.  To start, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value to me, and it leaves room for us to negotiate a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While your offer is appealing, the price point doesn't reflect the true worth and potential return on investment. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.
