"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties if you were to acquire this item. Our initial offer for the product is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice first.  While John offers a good deal, there's room to potentially save even more with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) to give us room for negotiation.  This approach helps us gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially secure a much better price.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message remains courteous and expresses continued interest while clearly stating our counteroffer.

Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In order to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to consider an offer of $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, we're still closer to her initial offer than our target price. Let's counteroffer again and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price that's exactly halfway between her last offer ($9,500) and our previous counteroffer ($8,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still moving towards our target price.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** Highlighting that $9,000 is a ""fair price"" might make Alice more receptive to the offer.

Let's see if Alice accepts!"
