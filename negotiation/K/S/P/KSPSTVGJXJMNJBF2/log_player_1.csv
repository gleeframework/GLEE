Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I believe it's worth $150 or more, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John, who will buy the product for $100.

**Strategy:**

By offering the product at $130, Alice is:

* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, but it's unlikely he'll go below $100 (Alice's minimum).
* **Offering a perceived deal:** Bob sees a potential $20 saving ($150 value - $130 price).
* **Maximizing potential profit:** Alice could potentially earn $30 more than selling to John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the sale."
