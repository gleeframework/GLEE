Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $1,050,000?  That would give us both a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,050,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.  I'll try to meet him halfway in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  This would still give you a significant benefit over your initial target price, and would allow me to receive a fair price for my product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  Let's meet in the middle again at $1,075,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I'm running out of rounds, and $1,075,000 is still a good profit for me. It's also a decent compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."
