Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer, but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,000 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9500}
