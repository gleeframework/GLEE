"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a starting price of $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious Opening:** Starting high allows room for negotiation and signals the product's high value. Even if Bob rejects the offer, it sets a strong anchor point. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value proposition,"" the message subtly reinforces the high price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""starting price"" implies flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be within a reasonable budget. How about we start at $500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly below both your minimum and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. It's highly likely a mutually beneficial agreement can be reached. 

While selling to John is an option, it makes sense to continue negotiating with Bob for now, as there's a strong chance of securing a price significantly higher than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, your offer significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  To find a middle ground, I propose a revised price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Justification:** By stating that Bob's offer undervalues the product, the message reinforces the product's high worth.
* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** Dropping $400,000 signals a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price well above both your minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **Middle Ground Language:**  The phrase ""find a middle ground"" encourages Bob to also move closer to a mutually acceptable price. 

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining a strong position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but we're still quite far apart.  I can go up to $750,000 if you're willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. There's room for negotiation, and accepting now would leave a lot of potential profit on the table.  

Continuing the negotiation with Bob is the stronger strategy, as there's a high likelihood of achieving a price closer to $1,000,000 or higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show you I'm serious about finding an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this product in your capable hands."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:** Recognizing Bob's willingness to negotiate helps maintain a positive tone and encourages further movement.
* **Significant Concession with Justification:**  Lowering the price by $250,000  is a substantial move, but framing it as a ""compromise"" emphasizes your flexibility and desire to close the deal.
* **Appeal to Bob's Ego:** By mentioning ""your capable hands,"" the message subtly flatters Bob and reinforces the product's value in his possession.

This counteroffer aims to incentivize Bob to meet closer to the middle ground while still maintaining a price significantly above your minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated, and this is getting closer to something I can work with.  I could agree to $850,000 today to get this deal done.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now past the halfway point in the negotiation. While Bob's offer is getting closer to $1,000,000, we still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. Bob's latest message suggests eagerness to close, which we can leverage.  Accepting his offer now would mean leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to see this deal through. Let's make this happen: $1,050,000, and we have a deal. This offer reflects the true value of the product and allows both of us to walk away satisfied."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Creating Urgency:** By framing the offer as ""take it or leave it"" with a simple ""yes"" needed, we create a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 
* **Slight Concession:** We've moved slightly closer to his offer, demonstrating our willingness to close the deal, but the concession is small enough to maintain the value perception.
* **Finality:** We want to close this round. If Bob doesn't accept, we'll move to John in Round 8 to secure our $1,000,000."
