"Hi Alice, while I appreciate the product, $20,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $14,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I could be flexible if we can settle closer to $17,000. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $17,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm firm at $12,000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere. ",12000.0,Bob,4,
