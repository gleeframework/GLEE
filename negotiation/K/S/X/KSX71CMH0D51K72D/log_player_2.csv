Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I could be flexible if we can settle closer to $17,000. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
