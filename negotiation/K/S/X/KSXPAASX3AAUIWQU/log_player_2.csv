Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already gone below my minimum price a few times, and I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to get at least $11,500 for the product. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $11,500.  We've been consistently lowering our offer, and it's unlikely we'll make significant progress in one round.  While buying from John means spending more ($15,000), it's better than potentially being stuck with no deal and having to go back to Alice at her final offer of $11,500."
