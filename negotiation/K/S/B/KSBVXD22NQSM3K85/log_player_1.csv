Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective. While that price doesn't quite reflect the product's full value, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we settle at $1,300,000?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $950,000? This would be a fair compromise and allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

Bob is unlikely to move significantly higher than his current offer. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
