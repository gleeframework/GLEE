"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000.  What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. While $15,000 reflects the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you partway. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $13,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is a significant drop.  To be fair to both of us,  I could come down to $12,750. This offer stands as a compromise and reflects the value you're gaining.",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,750 and $12,000. How about $12,375? Can you consider my offer?",12375.0,Bob,6,
