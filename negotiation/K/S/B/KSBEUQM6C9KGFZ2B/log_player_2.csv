"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that can bring significant value to your life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a good price, it's still within my budget to negotiate further. I want to see if I can get a better deal before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but also that I'm not afraid to negotiate.  $800,000 is still a good price for me, but leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is a great opportunity to own a unique product, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high for me. I'm happy she's willing to negotiate, but I want to see if we can get closer to my initial offer. I believe there's still room for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. This shows I'm taking her proposal seriously while still pushing for a lower price.  $900,000 is still a good deal for me, and it's likely a price Alice is willing to accept given her previous willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to find a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $925000. I believe the product's value is worth every penny, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm counteroffering at $912500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $912,500, which is within my budget and only slightly higher than my previous counteroffer. While I'd prefer to pay less, further negotiation could take a long time, and we're already halfway through the rounds. I'm confident this is a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity."
