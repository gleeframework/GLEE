Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This is a 50% markup from my guaranteed sale price to John. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** A higher price gives me a larger potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **Balancing Risk:**  While a higher price increases the chance of Bob rejecting the offer, the guaranteed sale to John ensures I won't lose money.
* **Strategic Consideration:**  Offering a price significantly higher than John's offer incentivizes Bob to seriously consider buying, as he might perceive a greater value in the product. 

This strategy balances the need for high earnings with the risk of losing the deal."
