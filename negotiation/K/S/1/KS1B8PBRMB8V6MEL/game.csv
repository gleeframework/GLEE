"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which is a fair price that reflects both our needs. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $1,350,000 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,380,000, which is a good compromise for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement in this round.",1380000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're definitely making progress. While I appreciate your compromise, $1,380,000 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend. I'm offering $1,360,000. This is a fair price that gets us both closer to our goals. Let's make this happen!",1360000.0,Bob,6,
