Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering your value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $1,300,000 is still below my minimum, and I have time to negotiate further."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000, which is a fair price that reflects both our needs. I believe this is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price with more negotiation.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're definitely making progress. While I appreciate your compromise, $1,380,000 is still a little more than I can comfortably spend. I'm offering $1,360,000. This is a fair price that gets us both closer to our goals. Let's make this happen!
