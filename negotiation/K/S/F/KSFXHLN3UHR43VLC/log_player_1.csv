Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, as I don't know Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Enthusiastic Tone:**  A positive and encouraging message aims to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Flexibility:** By asking for his thoughts, I'm opening the door for negotiation.
* **Plan B:** I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's counteroffers aren't satisfactory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Lowball Offer:**  While I need to get at least $10,000, Bob's offer is far too low. It's clear he's trying to take advantage. 
* **Negotiation is Key:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  
* **Not Selling to John Yet:** John offers a safe $10,000, but I'm hoping to get more by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, reflecting the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to emphasize why my price is still justified.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive tone to encourage further negotiation.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** I'm explicitly asking for a middle ground, making it clear that I'm open to reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me at $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to My Goal:** Bob's offer is now just $1,000 below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's a risk that further negotiation will result in a lower price, or that Bob will walk away.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate will take more time and effort, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome. 

**Selling to Bob at $11,000 is the most logical decision at this point.**  It's close to my desired price, and avoids the risk of ending up with a lower offer or losing the sale altogether."
