Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $630,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Position:** Alice has stated this is her final offer.  Continuing to push could irritate her and risk the deal.
* **Significant Savings:** $630,000 is significantly less than both John's offer ($1,000,000) and Alice's initial offer ($800,000). 
* **Limited Time:** While there are still rounds left, there's no guarantee of getting a better price, and you risk Alice withdrawing the offer altogether."
