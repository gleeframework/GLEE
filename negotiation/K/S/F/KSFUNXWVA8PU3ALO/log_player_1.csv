``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, giving me room to potentially negotiate down while still earning more than my minimum. It's also important to be friendly and open to negotiation in the message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $11,000, I can potentially get more by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range."

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $12,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to pay $11,800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can negotiate a bit higher. John is a safe option, but I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations with Bob."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,100. I'm willing to pay $11,900 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm choosing to sell to John.  Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but there's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a higher price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, and it's not worth risking a potential loss by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
