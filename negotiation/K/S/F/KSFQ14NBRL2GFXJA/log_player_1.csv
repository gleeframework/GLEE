# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm really aiming to stay under $12,000. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and allows for a good profit for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500.
