Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point as it's more than my minimum price of $120 and still leaves some room for negotiation with Bob.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to pay a price closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $130.  While it's more than what John is offering, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $140. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm offering a price of $135, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also holding firm on my desire to get a price closer to my desired price."
