You can do better than $140.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

I'm offering $130 for the product. This is a fair price considering it's worth $120 to Alice and $150 to me."

Alice has come down to $135, which is within my budget and still saves me money compared to buying from John.  Accepting this offer is the best choice."
