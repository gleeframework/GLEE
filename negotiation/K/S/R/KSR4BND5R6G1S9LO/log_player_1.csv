"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I need at least $8,000, so I can't go lower.
* **Bob's value:**  Knowing Bob values it at $10,000, I start high, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **First offer:**  A high initial offer is common in negotiations.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  $8,500 is closer to my minimum but still leaves some room for me to get a better price.
* **My goal:**  I'm aiming for a higher price. 
* **Next round:** I can make a counteroffer to see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My last offer:** I started at $9,500 and Bob countered at $8,500.  A $9,000 counteroffer is a compromise that's still within my desired range.
* **Middle ground:**  I'm trying to find a price that's fair to both of us.
* **Leaving room:**  This offer still leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't willing to go that high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below what I want. 
* **My goal:** I want to see if I can push for a higher price.
* **Next round:**  I can make a counteroffer and try to find a price we can both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:**  Bob's offer of $8,750 is getting closer to my minimum, so I'm making a counteroffer that's only slightly lower than my previous offer.
* **Signal willingness:**  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and find a solution. 
* **Final push:**  I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob to agree, but I'm still prepared to consider selling to John if necessary."
