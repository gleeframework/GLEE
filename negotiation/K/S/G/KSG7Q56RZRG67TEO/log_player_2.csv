"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** $9,500 is more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** Alice values the product at $8,000, so there's a potential for a price that benefits both parties. 
* **Counteroffer makes sense:** Bob should try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** A $9,000 offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate.
* **Still within Bob's budget:** It allows Bob to save $1,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Potential for agreement:** It leaves room for Alice to counter with a price slightly higher than her valuation, potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** $9,250 is within Bob's budget and significantly lower than John's price of $10,000.
* **Limited gains from further negotiation:**  While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk of Alice rejecting it and ending up with John's higher price.
* **Time and effort:** Further negotiation might consume valuable time and effort, making the current offer a better option for Bob."
