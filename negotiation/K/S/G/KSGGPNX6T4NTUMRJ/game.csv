"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let's see if we can work this out.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still a little over budget. How about $90? I'm really hoping to make this deal work.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. What do you say?",92.5,Alice,5,
