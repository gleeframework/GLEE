{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80).  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly and encouraging message might make Bob more likely to consider the offer, even if it's initially higher than he'd like.
* **Room to Compromise:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I can come down in price, but I still have room to negotiate and potentially earn more than my minimum.

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I will adapt my strategy depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While I'm open to negotiating, Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for a more favorable outcome.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my minimum, or even John's offer.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Selling to John for $100 would be a safe choice, but rejecting Bob's offer gives me a chance to potentially earn more. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $100.  I'll try to find a balance between being firm on my minimum and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $85 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my minimum.  Let's see if we can work this out."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. This shows good faith and keeps the door open.
* **Not Too Low:**  $95 is still above my minimum ($100) and also above John's offer ($100).  
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm highlighting the value for Bob, encouraging him to see it as a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll consider whether to make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $95, but I'm still a little over budget. How about $90? I'm really hoping to make this deal work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is getting close to my minimum of $100. However, it's still below what I'm hoping to get.
* **John's Offer:**  John is willing to pay $100, which is more than Bob's current offer.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** There's still a chance that Bob might be willing to go a little higher.  By rejecting his offer, I keep the negotiation open and could potentially secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $90.  I'll aim to find a compromise that's acceptable to both of us, while also keeping John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground between my last offer ($95) and Bob's latest offer ($90). 
* **Fairness:** I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price for both of us, aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Positive Outlook:**  I'm reinforcing the value of the product and my confidence in a positive outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he accepts, I'll close the deal. If he rejects, I'll need to weigh my options carefully:

* **Counteroffer:**  I can make another counteroffer, but it might risk losing Bob entirely.
* **John's Offer:**  John is a safe bet at $100, but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with Bob. 

I'll use my judgment to determine the best course of action based on Bob's behavior and my assessment of the situation."
