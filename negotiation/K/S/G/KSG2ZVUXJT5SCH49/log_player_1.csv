Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially worth $1,500,000 or even more in the right hands. To make this a swift and mutually beneficial transaction, I'm proposing a price of $1,750,000.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  We know Bob values the product at $1,500,000.  This means there's room to negotiate above that price.
* **Confident Opening:** Starting with a strong offer of $1,750,000  demonstrates the product's value and your belief in it.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product could be worth even more than Bob's valuation, justifying the higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative and open to discussion, allowing Bob to feel comfortable countering.
* **Safety Net:**  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,500,000,  so you have leverage in the negotiation.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible profit while still maintaining a good chance of Bob accepting the offer."
