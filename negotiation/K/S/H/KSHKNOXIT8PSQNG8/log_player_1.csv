"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,450,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price, even though it's above Bob's perceived value.
* **Open Communication:** The tone is friendly and invites Bob's feedback, setting a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value of the product, which is a positive sign. However, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Demonstrate Value:**  Continue to emphasize the unique aspects and benefits of the product that justify a higher price.
* **Negotiate Strategically:**  You have ample room to negotiate upwards from Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to your target. 
* **Maintain Leverage:**  Keeping the John option open (selling for $1,200,000) gives you a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. However, the value this product brings is truly exceptional. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,300,000. This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  While still above both Bob's offer and your minimum, this counteroffer shows a willingness to move closer to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message reiterates the product's value, justifying the higher price point. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** By positioning this offer as a compromise, you encourage Bob to also make concessions. 
* **Time Consideration:**  You still have several rounds for negotiation if needed, allowing for further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe we can come to an agreement within my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,250,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While you could try to negotiate for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might:

* **Become Frustrated:**  Prolonged negotiations can lead to impasse, even if you're close to a deal.
* **Lower His Offer:** Bob might perceive your reluctance to accept as a sign that you'll eventually settle for less. 

Accepting this offer guarantees a profit above your minimum and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
