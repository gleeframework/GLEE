"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is considerably less than what I can accept. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. I'm getting closer, but $14,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $8,000? I feel that's a fair offer considering the market value.",8000.0,Bob,4,
