"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1250000. I know it's worth $1000000 to you, but it's a valuable asset that I'm confident will bring you significant returns.  This price gives you a great opportunity to acquire it at a discount.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is a discount, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows him to get the product from John for $1,000,000, which is the best possible price for him."
