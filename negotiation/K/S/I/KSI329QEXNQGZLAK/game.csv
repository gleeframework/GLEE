"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I am only willing to pay up to $9500 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $9500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",9750.0,Alice,3,
