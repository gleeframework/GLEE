"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're trying to save as much money as possible. While $90 is within your budget, it's still more than the product's worth to Alice ($80).  You can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $90 is a bit high for me.  How about $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is still more than the product's worth to her ($80), and it's closer to her initial offer than your counteroffer. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $92 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $88. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob. I can do $91, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really like the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, but $91 is still more than the product's worth to her ($80). It's worth one more round of negotiation to see if you can get a better deal. You are getting closer to your goal of a lower price, and you have 5 more rounds to try."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I think we're getting close. How about $89?  I really want this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob. I can meet you at $90, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  Alice is offering $90, which is still more than the product's worth to her ($80) but only $10 more than her initial offer.
* **Your Goal:** You want to save as much money as possible, but you're running out of rounds. 
* **John's Offer:** John is offering the product for $100, which is more expensive than Alice's offer.
* **Decision:** Accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this scenario. It allows you to get the product for a slightly lower price than John's offer, and you've managed to negotiate a deal that's still within your budget."
