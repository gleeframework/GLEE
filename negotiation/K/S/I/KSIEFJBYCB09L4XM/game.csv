"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. My initial offer for the product is $14,000. I understand its value to you is $12,000, but I hope this price reflects a fair compromise. Looking forward to your response.",14000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm prepared to offer $12,500.  This represents a significant compromise for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,2,,
