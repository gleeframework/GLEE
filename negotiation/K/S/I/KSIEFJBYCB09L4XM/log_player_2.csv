"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both of us. My initial offer for the product is $14,000. I understand its value to you is $12,000, but I hope this price reflects a fair compromise. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. There are more rounds to go, so it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value I place on the product, I'm prepared to offer $12,500.  This represents a significant compromise for me, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12500}
