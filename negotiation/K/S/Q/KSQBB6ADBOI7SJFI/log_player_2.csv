"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'll choose option 2: Reject Alice's offer. 
If I accept her offer, I will be paying $1,350,000, which is $150,000 more than what I can get it for from John. It's better for me to reject the offer and buy the product from John.
