Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This is a starting point.  I'm offering a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it seems unreasonable. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counter-offers. I also have the fallback option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my desired price and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to show that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my initial offer. This keeps the negotiation going and avoids having to sell to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's still lower than my ideal price, it's very close to John's offer and allows me to finalize the sale without further negotiation.  I'm choosing to prioritize a quick sale over trying to squeeze out a few more dollars."
