"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. You know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  Therefore, it makes the most financial sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
