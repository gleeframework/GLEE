"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  This gives you a good deal, and it's still a fair price for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here. $850,000 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a good deal for both of us.  If you're serious about buying the product, let's meet in the middle.  I'm running out of time and John is waiting in the wings.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $800,000, so how about $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we're not going to be able to agree on a price.  I've already come down considerably, and I'm not sure I can go any lower.  I'm willing to offer you one final price of $875,000.  This is a great opportunity for you, and it's the best I can do.  If you're not interested, I'm going to sell to John. ",875000.0,Alice,7,
