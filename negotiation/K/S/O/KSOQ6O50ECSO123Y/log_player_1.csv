{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair.  This offer stands for 24 hours."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit margin. 
* **Time Limit:** The 24-hour limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to decide quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:**  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a clear understanding of your lowest acceptable price will be crucial. 
* **Relationship:** Consider if a long-term business relationship with Bob is more valuable than maximizing profit on this single transaction. This might influence your pricing strategy."
