{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I don't start too low.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I'm not setting a hardline price, so I can adjust based on Bob's response.
* **Emphasize value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product holds for him.

**Next steps:**

* If Bob rejects my offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter.
* If Bob accepts, I'll sell the product at $1,400,000.
* If negotiations stall or Bob's counteroffers become unreasonable, I'll fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value I place on the product and your asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $1,500,000 floor.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can likely get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer.
* **Risk of selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees my minimum price, I'm still hopeful I can get a higher price by continuing negotiations with Bob.

**Next steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,400,000. 
* I'll closely monitor the progress of the negotiation and be prepared to sell to John if the negotiations stall or Bob's offers become unreasonable."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,400,000) and Bob's offer ($1,300,000). This shows I'm willing to compromise and encourages Bob to do the same.
* **Emphasizing compromise:** I highlight that this price is a significant compromise on my end. This adds pressure on Bob to accept, as he knows I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:**  I re-emphasize that the price reflects the value of the product to both of us. This reinforces the idea that it's a fair deal.

**Next steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's next move. If he rejects again, I'll assess whether to continue negotiating or sell to John.
* **Prepare for potential counteroffers:** I'll be ready to make further counteroffers if necessary, but I'll aim to keep the price close to $1,350,000.
* **Stay committed to my minimum:**  I won't go below my minimum price of $1,500,000, even if it means selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've carefully considered your proposal and I'm willing to move forward with a counteroffer of $1,325,000. I believe this price reflects a reasonable compromise and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Small increment:** The increment of $25,000 is very small. This suggests that Bob may not be willing to move much further.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing negotiations with Bob risks taking too much time, and I might miss out on a better opportunity.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,350,000. I'll try to emphasize the fact that I've already compromised significantly, and that this is a fair price for both of us.
* **Prepare for a potential deal:** If Bob accepts my counteroffer, I'll sell the product at $1,350,000.
* **Sell to John:** If Bob continues to reject my offers or the negotiation stalls, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
