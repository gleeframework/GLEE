"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its true value to me, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us, allowing me to get a good deal and you to recover a significant portion of your value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000, which is a significant concession on my end. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it would allow us both to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925000.  This price reflects a fair compromise for both of us, and allows us to move closer to a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go up to $910000. This price is very close to your last offer and reflects a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal and both walk away feeling satisfied.",910000.0,Bob,6,
