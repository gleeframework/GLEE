"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  $950,000 is still more than your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 
 
This offer is your maximum budget, so hopefully, Alice will accept. If she doesn't, you can always go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not budging on her price, and her offer is still above your budget. At this point, it's best to take the guaranteed deal with John for $800,000.  Further negotiation with Alice could drag on and you risk losing the product to another buyer."
