"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's value and wouldn't be a fair deal for me.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to drop my price to $800,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the benefit you'll get from the product.  What do you say?
