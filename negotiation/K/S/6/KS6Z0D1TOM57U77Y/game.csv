"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $600,000? I think that's a fair starting point.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's value and wouldn't be a fair deal for me.  Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to drop my price to $800,000, which is still a good deal for you, considering the benefit you'll get from the product.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,3,
