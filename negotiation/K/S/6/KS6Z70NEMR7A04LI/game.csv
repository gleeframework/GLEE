"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",10750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,750, which would be $10,125. Can you consider that price?",10125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm happy to see us moving in the right direction, $10,125 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we try $10,500?  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and it gets us closer to my minimum price. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to go up to $10,250, which is as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that price?",10250.0,Bob,6,
