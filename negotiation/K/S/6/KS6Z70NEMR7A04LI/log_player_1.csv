{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's below your minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also highlights the value of the product to Bob, making him more likely to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to counteroffer Bob to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,750, which would be $10,125. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,125 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to counteroffer Bob again. I'm hoping that with each counteroffer, I can gradually push the price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm happy to see us moving in the right direction, $10,125 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we try $10,500?  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product, and it gets us closer to my minimum price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to go up to $10,250, which is as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  It's becoming clear that I'm not going to be able to get the price I want from Bob.  At this point, it's better to sell to John for the full price and avoid any further negotiation."
