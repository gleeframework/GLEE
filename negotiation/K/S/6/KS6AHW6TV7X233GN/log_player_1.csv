"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $110 for it."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value of $100. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, hoping to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the value of the product without explicitly stating its worth to me. This allows for a bit of mystery and potential for Bob to see it as a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:**  $90 is below my minimum acceptable value of $100. Accepting this would mean losing money.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is low, he's shown interest. This indicates there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to continue exploring a deal.
* **John is a Safety Net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $100 gives me leverage in this negotiation. I can be more firm in my counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by offering a counter.
* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone and emphasizing that I'm still interested in making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** $85 is below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I'm not willing to lose money on this sale.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in Round 4, and there are only 6 rounds remaining.  The likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price with Bob within this limited time is slim.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $100, which is more than what Bob is currently offering.  

I'm confident in John's willingness to buy, so I'm choosing to sell to him rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
