"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it.  I'm starting the price at $200.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 
 
 I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit, but still leaving room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to see what he counteroffers and decide if it's worth continuing.  If he's too low, I'll happily go with John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not desperate to sell right now. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. There are still 8 rounds left, and there's a good chance I can find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we split the difference and I come down to $175? That's still a good deal for you and a reasonable compromise for me."", ""product_price"": 175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I am still looking for a product within my budget. I would like to propose $160 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $160 is close enough to my minimum price of $150 that I'm willing to accept it.  It's a better deal than selling to John and saves me the time and effort of further negotiation."
