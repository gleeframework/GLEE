"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,400,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the value of the product and provides us both with a fair deal. Let's make this happen!",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $1,550,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows for a profitable sale for you while still fitting within my budget. Let's close this deal!",1550000.0,Bob,4,
