"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000 for this product.  It's a great product but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still have room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $14,000. Selling to John at this point would mean leaving $1,000 on the table, which is not ideal.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your price point.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, but that's my final offer.  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
