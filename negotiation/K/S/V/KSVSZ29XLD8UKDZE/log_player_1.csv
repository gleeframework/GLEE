Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,500,000, so starting closer to that figure increases your chances of a larger gain. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to negotiate if he wishes, potentially still landing within a very profitable range for you.
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency encourages Bob to act quickly and prevents him from shopping around or second-guessing the value.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 with John, so there's less risk in starting with a strong offer to Bob."
