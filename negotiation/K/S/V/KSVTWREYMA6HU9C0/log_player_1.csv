Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so that's your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's enticing to Bob but also maximizes your profit. Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you can afford to be a little bolder.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're starting high to leave room for negotiation but staying below your guaranteed price.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) creates urgency.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reinforces the price.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You can then decide if you want to come down slightly or hold firm knowing you have John as a backup."
