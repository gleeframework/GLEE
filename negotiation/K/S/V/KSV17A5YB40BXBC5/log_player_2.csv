"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price.  $5,000 is a good starting point, but we can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows us to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about negotiating and sets a strong starting point for the counter-offer process.  It's likely Alice will counter back, but this gives us room to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm not ready to accept $4,500 yet. By rejecting her offer, I can continue to push for a lower price and see if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4200}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to split the difference between my last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and hopefully pushes Alice closer to my desired price point.  I'm also mindful of the limited rounds and want to avoid getting stuck in a long back-and-forth."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $4,350. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $4,350
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $4,350, which is only $150 away from my last offer. Given the limited rounds remaining, it's worth accepting this offer.  I've already saved a significant amount compared to buying from John, and continuing to negotiate risks running out of time and being forced to buy from John at a higher price."
