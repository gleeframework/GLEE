"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  Given its unique features and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering the value it brings.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me while also allowing for a reasonable profit for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise where we both benefit.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my target.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise here. I've tried to be flexible, but $1,075,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,090,000. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options for selling the product.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
