"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit below my target price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10,800. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,800 is still a bit outside my budget, though.  Let's split the difference and go with $10,600.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",10600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,600 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of selling the product to you for $10,700. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10700.0,Alice,5,
