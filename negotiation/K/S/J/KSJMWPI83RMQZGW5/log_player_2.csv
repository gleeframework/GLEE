I'm still hoping to get a better price.  $10,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,250.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

I'm going to buy the product from John.  While I can likely get Alice down a bit more, the risk is too high that we won't agree, and I'll have to pay more than $10,000.  John's price is right at my limit, and it's a sure thing."
