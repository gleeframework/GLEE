"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. I believe it holds immense value for you, and I'm confident it will be a significant asset. My initial price is $1,200,000. I'm open to discussing a fair deal, but I'm confident this price reflects the product's true worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is still too high. You are aiming to save as much money as possible, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it doesn't quite reflect the value this product holds.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price allows us both to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome and ensures a smooth transaction. Let's work together to reach a final agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While $1,000,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than the $900,000 you offered.  There's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a lower price."
