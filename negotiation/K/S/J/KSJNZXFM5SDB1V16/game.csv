"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. However, $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  While I agree $850,000 is closer to fair, I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to settle around there?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850,000 and $750,000, which is $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
