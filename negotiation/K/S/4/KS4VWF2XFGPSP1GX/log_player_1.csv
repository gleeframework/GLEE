I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John, but I'll keep that option open if negotiations don't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a bit closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 105}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer, $92 is still below my minimum. I'm not ready to give up yet, and I'm hopeful we can find a middle ground in the next round.  I'm still keeping the option of selling to John open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $92 is still too low for me. Let's try $100. That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $97 is getting closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit higher.  I'm not ready to settle just yet, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price.  I'm also keeping the option of selling to John in mind, but I'm still optimistic about this negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $98 is tempting, I'm determined to reach my target price of $100.  I'm confident we can close the deal in the next round.  However, I'm also aware of the time constraint and will consider selling to John if the next round doesn't go as planned."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we've been going back and forth, but I'm sticking to my price of $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's my final offer.  Let me know if you're ready to make the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's come down to the wire.  While I'd like to get closer to my desired price, I'm not confident that Bob will budge any further.  I'm also running out of time.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it ensures that I get my minimum price and don't risk losing any more money in this negotiation."
