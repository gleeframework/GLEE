,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9000 is simply too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $10500, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a way to make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $10250. Can we meet at this price?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10250 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a little too far apart. Let's split the difference and aim for $10375. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",10375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $10375 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10200, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet at this price?",10200.0,Bob,6,
