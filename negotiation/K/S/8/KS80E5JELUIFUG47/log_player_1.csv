{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Offering a ""fair"" price:** Framing the price as fair encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, which could lead to a faster deal.

**Important Note:**  This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I have 8 rounds left and can counteroffer, potentially pushing the price closer to my desired range.
* **Selling to John is a strong option:**  If negotiations don't progress, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I meet my minimum requirement.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price closer to $1,400,000, aiming to bridge the gap and secure a better deal. I will continue to assess the situation and consider selling to John if negotiations become unproductive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I appreciate your offer,  $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and it still allows you to get a valuable product at a competitive price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer close to my minimum:** I'm proposing a price slightly above Bob's offer,  showing a willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum threshold.
* **Emphasize fairness and compromise:** The message emphasizes a fair compromise and the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider my offer.
* **Keep the negotiation going:** By proposing a counteroffer, I'm keeping the negotiations open and avoiding a premature sale to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will monitor Bob's response and adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds. If Bob continues to offer significantly lower prices, I will strongly consider selling to John to ensure I get the desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. Can you consider $1,300,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While closer to my desired price, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I have 6 rounds left, and there's still room to negotiate and potentially reach a higher price.
* **Selling to John is a secure alternative:** If negotiations stall, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring my minimum profit. 

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price closer to $1,350,000, again aiming for a compromise while staying above my minimum. I will continue to evaluate the situation and consider selling to John if Bob's offers remain persistently low."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. While I value your commitment, $1,300,000 is still a bit below my minimum. Let's try $1,325,000.

* **Negotiation is still possible:** I have 4 rounds left, and there's potential to push the price higher.
* **John is a safety net:**  If negotiations break down, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, guaranteeing my minimum profit.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,315,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,320,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,320,000, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more adjustment to meet you halfway. Can you consider $1,310,000?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Only 2 rounds left:** With only two rounds remaining, the chances of getting Bob to meet my minimum price are slim.
* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,310,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is a much better outcome than accepting Bob's current offer.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, the risk of failing to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds is too high.  Selling to John ensures I achieve my minimum profit and avoid potential losses."
