Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can find a price closer to its true worth for both of us. I would like to propose a price of $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  While $950,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, I'm still a bit higher than your offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I think we can find a fair price for both of us. Let's aim for $1,025,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,025,000 is a good deal.  It's significantly more than selling to John, and we're getting closer to a resolution."
