Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $1500000 is certainly a figure to consider, it doesn't fully reflect the unique value and potential of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. I believe this price remains fair and allows for both of us to benefit from this opportunity. Let me know your thoughts.
