"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1,000,000. It's a significant discount from its true value, and I believe it's a price that's fair to both of us.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my range.  Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows us both to come to a reasonable agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is unfortunately still too low for me.  However, I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $925,000 for the product. This allows us both to make a good deal while remaining within our respective budgets.  What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's settle on $912,500 for the product. This compromise allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you think?",912500.0,Alice,5,
