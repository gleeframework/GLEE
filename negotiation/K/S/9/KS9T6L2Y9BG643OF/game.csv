"Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $80.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $120. It's a great compromise between your offer and my initial price. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $100? I'm really keen on this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",110.0,Alice,5,
