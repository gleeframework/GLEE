"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth at least $100 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to give myself some room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion, highlighting the product's value. 
* **Strategy:**  This initial offer is a test.  If Bob accepts, great! If he rejects, we can see where his counteroffer lands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with.
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $100 is my safety net, but I'm not ready to give up on potentially getting a better price from Bob.
* **Negotiation:** There's still room to negotiate. I can likely secure a higher price if I push back a little."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is tempting, I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and meet at $95? It's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm increasing Bob's offer by $5, which is halfway between our positions. This demonstrates willingness to compromise but still keeps the price above my minimum.
* **Message:** I'm reinforcing that I value the product, while also expressing a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer positions me for a potential agreement in the next round. If Bob rejects, I'll consider my options for a final counteroffer or selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I'd like to try to meet you in the middle. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price from Bob.
* **Negotiation:** There's still room for a few more rounds of negotiation. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give up on getting a better price just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go lower than $90. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate the value of this product.  Let's make a deal at $90, and we can both move on."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm firming up my position by dropping my counteroffer to $90, which is my absolute minimum. This shows I'm serious about getting a price closer to my value, while still leaving some room for compromise. 
* **Message:** I'm highlighting the value of the product and suggesting that $90 is a fair deal for both parties.
* **Strategy:** If Bob accepts, we're done. If he rejects, we're nearing the end of our negotiations. I'll likely accept his next counteroffer if it's close to $90, or I'll sell to John to avoid losing any more time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $82 is the most I can afford. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** $82 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I've already lowered my price considerably, and I'm running out of time. 
* **Selling to John:** It's becoming increasingly likely that Bob won't meet my minimum price. Selling to John for $100 ensures I get a fair price and avoid further negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of continuing negotiations is that Bob might not budge, and I could lose out on both his deal and the deal with John. Selling to John now guarantees a sure profit."
