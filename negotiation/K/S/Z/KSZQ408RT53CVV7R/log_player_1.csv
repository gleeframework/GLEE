Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,200,000 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, giving you a solid starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like you're being unreasonable.
* **It reflects the product's value to him:**  $1,200,000 is less than the product's value to Bob, making it a potentially attractive deal for him.

By starting at this price, you open the negotiation effectively, leaving room to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is more than what John is offering, it's still significantly below the value the product holds for Bob ($1,500,000). This means there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to what the product is truly worth. Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  The product is worth a lot more than $850,000, especially to someone who values it like you do. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  It's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a strong position.
* **Fair Value:**  $1,000,000 is closer to your desired price while still being significantly lower than Bob's perceived value.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes a ""win-win"" scenario, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.

By offering $1,000,000, you are showing flexibility, keeping the negotiation moving, and aiming for a deal that still yields a good profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget in mind.  How about $925,000? That's a significant move on my part. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Gain:**  While $925,000 isn't your ideal price, it's still a considerable profit compared to selling to John for $800,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  Even though Bob has been firm on his budget, there's always a chance that you could convince him to increase his offer slightly if you were to reject his offer again. However, the risk of losing the deal entirely by continually rejecting his offers outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price.
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing the negotiation could prolong the process, especially if Bob remains stubborn. Accepting his offer allows you to secure a good deal and move on.

While a price closer to $1,000,000 would be ideal, $925,000 represents a solid deal that balances potential gain with minimizing risk and time investment."
