Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 (Bob's value) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. Here's a strategy:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer slightly below your guaranteed price. This leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum.
2. **Justification:** Provide a reason for the high price, emphasizing the product's value (even if Bob won't realize its full worth to you).

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique features and market potential, I'm valuing it at $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $1,450,000 is a strong opening, leaving you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Value Justification:** By highlighting ""unique features"" and ""market potential,"" you aim to create perceived value in Bob's mind.
* **Confident Tone:** Using phrases like ""pleased to offer"" and ""fair reflection"" projects confidence in your pricing.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or reject your initial price. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting John's offer.
* **Negotiation:** If Bob negotiates, focus on the product's benefits and your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price within reason."
