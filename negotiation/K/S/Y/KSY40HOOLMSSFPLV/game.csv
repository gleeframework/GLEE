"Hello Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly beneficial for you and I'm happy to discuss a deal. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000.  This takes into account the significant value it offers. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product extends far beyond the $1,100,000 mark, especially considering the potential benefits it holds for your operations.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,900,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the true value of what's on the table.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,450,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the potential benefits it could bring to my operations.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
