Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.

Bob has met your minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate him higher in the remaining rounds, so it's best to take the sure thing."
