"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer above your target price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially secures a better outcome.  
* **Gauging Bob's Interest:** By starting high, we can gauge Bob's level of interest and get an idea of his perceived value of the product. 
* **John as Backup:**  We have the security of John's offer ($1,500,000), which represents our ""walk-away"" point. We should aim for a deal significantly better than this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $1,800,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is substantial and closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. We are aiming for the best possible price and have the security of John's offer as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value.  To be frank,  $1,800,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,900,000? I believe that's a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Appearing Flexible):** By suggesting a price halfway between our last offer and Bob's counteroffer, we are demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  We are still significantly above John's offer ($1,500,000) and holding firm in a range that represents a substantial profit.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help us gauge Bob's flexibility and determine if a deal within our desired range is achievable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $1,750,000 for the product. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concessions:** Bob's offer only increased by $50,000, indicating he might have more room to move. We want to encourage larger steps towards our desired range.
* **Time Consideration:** While we are getting closer to John's offer, we still have six rounds left.  It's worth pressing for a better price at this stage.
* **Strategic Pressure:**  A further rejection might prompt Bob to significantly increase his offer in the next round, as he'll be aware we have other options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I value your interest, the gap between our positions is still a bit too wide.  I'd be willing to accept $1,850,000, but that's my final offer.  It represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Tactic:** By presenting this as our ""final offer,"" we create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to make a serious decision.  
* **Justification:** We've provided a reason for our position (""significant compromise""), making the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The price of $1,850,000 is still a considerable gain over John's offer, leaving us with a comfortable profit margin. 
* **Time Management:** We are now past the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. It's a good time to push for a close and avoid unnecessary back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,825,000 for the product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,825,000 is a significant amount and only slightly below our ""final offer"" of $1,850,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further negotiation might yield smaller and smaller concessions from Bob. It's unlikely we can push him much higher. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could hold out for a slightly better deal, there's a risk Bob walks away, leaving us to accept John's lower offer.  
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now means we receive the payment sooner, allowing us to potentially reinvest it or put the funds to use. 

By accepting Bob's offer, we are securing a substantial profit over our minimum acceptable price and minimizing potential risks."
