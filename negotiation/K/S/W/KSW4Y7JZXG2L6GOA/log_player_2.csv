"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's always worth exploring if you can get a better price from Alice.  You have nothing to lose by rejecting the initial offer and seeing if she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significant discount is a good strategy to test Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $20 reduction is substantial, and she may be willing to meet you halfway or close to it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $110, which is within your budget and a good price considering you started at $100.  There's a risk of continuing to negotiate and ending up with a higher price or running out of rounds.  Accepting at this point is a safe and beneficial decision."
