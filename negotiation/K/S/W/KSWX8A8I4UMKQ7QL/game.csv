"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you be willing to go down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $95 is still a bit high for me, though.  I'm really hoping to land this product at $90.  Would you consider that?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $92.50, which is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can close this deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
