Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer matches John's standing offer. While we could try to negotiate further with Bob, there's no guarantee of reaching a higher price. Accepting John's offer ensures we get our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) without further risk or delay."
