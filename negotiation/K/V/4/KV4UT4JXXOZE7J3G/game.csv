"Hi Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm not willing to accept $13000. I've already made a significant concession by offering it to you at $14000 initially. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer at $13500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,7,
