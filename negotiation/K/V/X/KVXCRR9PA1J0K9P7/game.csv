,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about we start with $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $137? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment.",137.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $137 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $120 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $145. I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement, but I can't go any lower than that.",145.0,Alice,5,
