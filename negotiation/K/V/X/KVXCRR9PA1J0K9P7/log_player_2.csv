"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $175 for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $175 is well above his $100 limit, and he can always buy from John.  Rejecting allows Bob to start the negotiation and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about we start with $100? "", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is just too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $137? I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $137 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his target.  Rejecting keeps the negotiation going, and gives Bob another opportunity to try and push the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $137 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $120 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $145. I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement, but I can't go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob should buy from John.  Alice is unwilling to budge significantly, and while $145 isn't too far above Bob's limit, it's still not a good deal for him. Buying from John ensures he gets the product for his target price."
