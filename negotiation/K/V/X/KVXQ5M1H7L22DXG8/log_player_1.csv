Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy for Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Scenario**

* **Alice's Value:** The product is worth $12,000 to Alice (her minimum acceptable price).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $10,000 to Bob (his maximum willingness to pay).
* **John's Guarantee:** Alice has a guaranteed sale of $12,000 to John if Bob declines.

**Optimal Strategy**

Alice should aim for a price slightly below Bob's maximum willingness to pay. This maximizes her potential profit while still ensuring the deal is attractive enough for Bob to accept.

**Offer to Bob**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $9,950. I think it's a great deal for you, and I'm hoping for a quick sale."", ""product_price"": 9950}
```

**Why this offer makes sense:**

* **Price Advantage:** The offer is significantly lower than Bob's perceived value of $10,000, making it enticing.
* **Profit Maximization:** Alice secures a profit of $9,950, which is very close to Bob's maximum and significantly better than selling for her minimum to John. 
* **Urgency:**  The message hints at a ""quick sale,"" subtly encouraging Bob to act fast.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might decline even a favorable offer. However, this strategy maximizes Alice's chances of getting the best possible price from Bob."
