"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is still a fantastic deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but it's still a bit higher than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little more, but $1,150,000 is still too low.  I'm feeling $1,250,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
