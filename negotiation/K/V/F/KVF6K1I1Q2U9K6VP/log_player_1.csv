Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation. I'm also confident that I can sell the product to John for $150 if Bob doesn't accept, so I'm not afraid to be firm in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I won't accept anything less than $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer to $160. This shows that I'm willing to compromise, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. I believe this counteroffer gives Bob a good reason to accept, while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to go lower than that, and I'm confident that I can get a better price from John. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
