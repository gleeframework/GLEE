"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,350,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great investment for you. I'm confident you'll find this price fair, given the product's value and the potential returns it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is above that. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit steep for me. Considering the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product is truly unique, and its value is much higher than that. I'm willing to come down a bit, and I'm offering you $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm confident that this price will be attractive to you and allows us to move forward with the sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his limit, it's still above what he's willing to pay. He should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,150,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that will generate significant returns.  I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a price that's closer to my minimum.  I'm offering $1,200,000. This is a final compromise, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is the maximum price he's willing to pay, and it aligns with his budget constraint. Continuing to negotiate might lead to further rounds and could potentially result in Alice rejecting future counteroffers, which would force Bob to buy from John at the same price. It's more efficient to accept this offer and close the deal."
