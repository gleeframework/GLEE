"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1200000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,200,000 is too high for him, and he can get the product for less from John.  There's no reason to accept this offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. He can get the product from John for a better price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further, but  $800,000 is still the best deal available."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up, but $900000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950000.  This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away with a good deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice has come down to $950,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price, but it's still higher than what John is offering. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice, as there's a good chance the price won't go lower, and Bob risks losing the chance to buy from John."
