"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a good price, it's still higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. There's room for negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay, which is $10,000. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product.  If she rejects this, I'll move on to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,500, which is still above my ideal price but within my budget. It's worth accepting this offer as further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether.  While I could try to counter again,  I don't want to push my luck and risk ending up with nothing."
