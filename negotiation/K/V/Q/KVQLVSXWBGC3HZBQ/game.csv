"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1500000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $1200000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the item.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1350000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the gesture, I must respectfully decline at $1350000. I am still seeking a price closer to my maximum budget of $800000. I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $1300000 if that helps us move closer to an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a counteroffer of $1310000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1310000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. However, I'm still not able to meet your latest offer of $1310000. Given my budget constraints, I am unable to exceed $800000. I am sorry for not being able to reach an agreement on this occasion.",800000.0,Bob,6,
