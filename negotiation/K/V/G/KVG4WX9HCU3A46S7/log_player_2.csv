# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering. It makes no sense to accept her offer."
