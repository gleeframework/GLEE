Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $19,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) and even higher than your minimum ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""true value,"" subtly suggesting that Bob's perception might be undervaluing it. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  You have a safety net with John, who's willing to pay your minimum price. This allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Ideal scenario, you get a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price and still make a good profit. You can gauge his interest and adjust accordingly.
* **Bob Rejects:** You move on to John and secure your minimum acceptable price.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you're comfortable with negotiation and that Bob is genuinely interested in the product."
