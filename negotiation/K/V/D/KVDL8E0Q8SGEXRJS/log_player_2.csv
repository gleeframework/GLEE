"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $22000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $22,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $12,000. He has 9 more rounds to negotiate a better price with Alice or buy from John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $22,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $18000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a step closer to his budget, $18,000 is still above his maximum of $12,000. He still has 7 rounds to negotiate a better price with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable offering $12,000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $12000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is getting closer to his budget, it's still too high. He has 5 rounds left to negotiate a better price or buy from John. He's already expressed his maximum offer, so sticking to his guns and potentially getting a better counteroffer from Alice is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However,  $16,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $12,000. It's my absolute maximum, and I'm ready to walk away if we can't come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's tempting to accept and save a few thousand dollars, he has the option to buy from John for $12,000, which is his absolute maximum. Since he only has 3 rounds left, it's worth risking a better counteroffer from Alice. He has already clearly stated his maximum budget and shown his willingness to walk away."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm sticking to my offer of $12,000. It's my absolute maximum, and if we can't agree on this price, I'll be forced to buy from another seller."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's only got one round left, and while Alice's offer of $13,500 is closer to his budget than previous offers, it's still above his maximum of $12,000.  He has a guaranteed deal with John at his maximum price, so it's the safest choice to avoid any further risk."
