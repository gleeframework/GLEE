,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $22000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm comfortable offering $12000. This is my absolute maximum, and I'm ready to close the deal at this price.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $12000 is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $16000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,5,
