Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  By starting at $12,000, there's room for me to drop the price if Bob counters, while still making a profit beyond my minimum of $15,000.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging message helps build rapport and increases the chances of a successful negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a sale.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, counter again, or move on to John to ensure my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is far too low, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate. There's still room for me to counter and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John as a Backup:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer who's willing to pay my minimum price gives me leverage in this negotiation. 

**Next Step:**

* I'll counter Bob's offer, aiming to find a price point that's closer to my desired price while still remaining within the realm of possibility for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still keeping the product within your reach. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:**  This counteroffer is a significant move closer to Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.
* **Still Profitable:**  $10,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights that the price still allows Bob to access a valuable product.

**Next Step:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've secured a sale at a price that's good for both of us.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to analyze his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John to ensure my minimum profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for $8,000.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is close, but not enough:**  While $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  John has already expressed a willingness to buy the product for $15,000, which is a guaranteed profit for me.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk that he might walk away completely.  It's not worth the risk of potentially ending up with no sale at all when I have a secure offer from John.

**Next Step:**

* I'll sell the product to John to ensure my minimum profit and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
