"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get as close to his maximum budget as possible while still leaving room for potential negotiation.  $8,500 is a significant discount from Alice's offer and might encourage her to consider it. It's also a starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still keeping the product within your reach. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his maximum threshold of $8,000.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue negotiating. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, especially since she has already dropped her price once."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for $8,000.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  Bob is using a strong tactic here by declaring this his final offer. This puts pressure on Alice to accept or risk losing the deal.
* **Bridge to John:**  Mentioning the $8,000 alternative subtly reminds Alice that she doesn't have all the leverage. 
* **Small Increment:**  A $1,000 increase from the previous offer is enough to show progress but also positions Bob close to his limit.

It's a risky move, but with Alice already dropping her price once, there's a chance she'll accept. If not, Bob can always switch to John."
