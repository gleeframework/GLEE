"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still keeping the product within your reach. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product elsewhere for $8,000.  Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Bob,4,
