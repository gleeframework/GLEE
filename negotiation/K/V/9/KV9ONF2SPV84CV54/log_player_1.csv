Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
