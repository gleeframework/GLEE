"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 20000} 

I'm starting high, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.  If he's truly interested, he might counter with a reasonable offer. If not, I can always fall back on John's $15,000 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $17,500. This is a compromise that's closer to my minimum value, and hopefully, it will entice Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. I believe there's room for improvement. I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $16,000.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while maintaining a fair price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $14,000 is close to my minimum value, I'm still hesitant. I believe I can push for a little more. If Bob is truly interested, he'll likely counter again, and I'll have more negotiating power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500} 
```

I'm going to offer $14,500.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum.  This might be enough to entice Bob to finally accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum value, we are running out of time.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees a sale and a price above my minimum.  It's time to move on."
