``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to consider the offer.  I'll keep John's offer of $15,000 in mind as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $15,000. While I'd prefer to make a deal with Bob, the negotiations have stalled. Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate. It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John rather than risk losing out on a higher price altogether."
