"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm hoping we can agree on a price that works a bit better for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1,050,000? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $950,000. Would that be workable?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about the value I've invested in this product. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm ready to finalize this deal, but I can't quite reach $1,025,000.  My absolute best offer is $975,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",975000.0,Bob,6,
