"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll really love it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if it's much more affordable. How about $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $6,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000,  and I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $7,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and my original offer of $15,000. How about $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $11,000 is still more than I want to spend.  How about we try splitting the difference between your last offer and my last counter-offer? I'd be willing to go up to $9,000.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I think we're really close now! However, $9,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $12,000 for the product. I'll meet you halfway between $9,000 and my minimum of $12,000. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,7,
