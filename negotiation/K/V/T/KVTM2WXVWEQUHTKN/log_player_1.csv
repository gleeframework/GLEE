"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price that's still within Bob's budget, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Leaving Room:** I have room to lower the price if Bob rejects my offer, but I'm still aiming for a sale above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm looking for a price closer to my budget. How about we aim for $1,300,000? I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal is Still Higher:** My minimum price is $1,500,000.  Bob's offer is still below that, even though it's closer.
* **More Negotiation Room:** I want to see if I can push Bob higher. I have more rounds left, so there's still time to find a better deal.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's a chance I can get a slightly better price with Bob. The potential reward justifies the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a great price for a product of this quality, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny for you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Reframing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to see it as a good investment.
* **Urgency:** The ""Let's close this deal"" language adds a sense of urgency, hoping Bob will want to finalize the transaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I'm willing to meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1,325,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **More Negotiation Rounds:** We have 6 rounds remaining, which is enough time to see if I can push Bob higher.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** There's a chance I can secure a price closer to my target with continued negotiation. Selling to John right now would be a guaranteed $1,500,000, but the potential for a better deal with Bob outweighs the risk."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm feeling flexible, and I'm willing to come down to $1,340,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1340000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise & Finality:**  I'm showing flexibility by coming down slightly from my previous offer. I'm also stating it's my ""final offer"" to put pressure on Bob.
* **Appeal to Fairness:** Emphasizing ""fair price for both of us"" appeals to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:**  The ""make this deal happen"" language creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to act quickly. 

This approach aims to reach a mutually acceptable price while still staying close to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget, how about we settle at $1,330,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Target:**  Bob's offer, while closer, is still below my minimum target of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Rounds Remaining:** We have four rounds left, which is still enough time to potentially get a better offer from Bob.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John now guarantees me $1,500,000, but I'm still within striking distance of a potential higher price with Bob. I'm willing to take the risk for the potential reward."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,335,000? This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair price for both parties.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1335000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between our last offers. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Finality:**  I'm stating this is my ""final offer"" to put pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Urgency:** The ""Let's make this happen"" language adds urgency, hoping to push Bob towards a decision.

This approach aims to reach a mutually acceptable price while still remaining within my minimum value. With only four rounds left, I need to be decisive in finding a solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your reasoning, Alice. I am willing to meet you halfway again. Would $1,332,500 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,332,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,332,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We have only two rounds left, and I'm unlikely to get Bob to budge much further.
* **Close to My Minimum:** While I'm disappointed that I couldn't get closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is only $17,500 below my minimum value.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John ensures me $1,500,000, which is a safe and reliable outcome. It's not the most I could have potentially gotten, but it's a good outcome given the circumstances. 

With limited time remaining, it's prudent to secure the guaranteed sale with John rather than risk further negotiation with Bob."
