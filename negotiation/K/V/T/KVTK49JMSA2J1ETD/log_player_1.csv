{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm trying to get a price closer to my minimum of $120, but I also want to leave room for negotiation.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider his counteroffer and whether it's worth continuing negotiations with him, or if I should just sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $85?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to $120. I'll counter with a price in between his offer and my desired price, and see how he reacts."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88.  That's a good compromise, and I'm sure you'll still be happy with that price. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, $88 is still below my target.  I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise. If Bob rejects that, I'll sell to John for $120."
