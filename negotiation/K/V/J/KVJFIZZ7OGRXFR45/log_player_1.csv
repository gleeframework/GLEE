{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I know it's incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,800,000."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this offer:

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you have significant leverage.  Starting high allows you to potentially capture a larger portion of the value Bob places on the product.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still room to negotiate down towards your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000."
