"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and potential for you.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a considerable reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, as it's well above what I would pay John for the product.  Let's try to make this happen.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the  $1,200,000 offer is still too low for me to consider. I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,600,000. This takes into account the value it holds and represents a significant compromise on my end. If this doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
