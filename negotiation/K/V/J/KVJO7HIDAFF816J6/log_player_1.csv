Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product, which I believe holds significant value for someone like you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000, starting with a significantly higher price ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit margin.
* **Confident Language:** Using phrases like ""unique product,"" ""significant value,"" and ""confident you'll recognize its worth"" aims to create a perception of high value and desirability.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects this initial high offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000, ensuring you don't lose out."
