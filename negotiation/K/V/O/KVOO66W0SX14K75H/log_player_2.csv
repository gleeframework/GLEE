"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as there's a large gap to close."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $22,000 is out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective. However, $10,000 significantly undervalues the product and its capabilities. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is still significantly higher than my budget. While it's a step in the right direction, I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  Given our previous discussions and my budget constraints, I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, and I understand your constraints. Let's meet in the middle - how about $15,500? This accounts for the product's value while hopefully still working for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is still above my budget.  While it's tempting to keep negotiating,  I've already gone through multiple rounds and I'm starting to run out of time.  It's more efficient to secure the product from John at my maximum price point of $10,000."
