,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $22,000 is out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective. However, $10,000 significantly undervalues the product and its capabilities. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  Given our previous discussions and my budget constraints, I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, and I understand your constraints. Let's meet in the middle - how about $15,500? This accounts for the product's value while hopefully still working for you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
