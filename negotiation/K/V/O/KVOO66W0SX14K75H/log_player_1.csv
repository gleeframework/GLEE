Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $22,000 is out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:

This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.
