Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer, but unfortunately $1,100,000 is simply too far below my minimum asking price.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm confident this product will be extremely valuable for you, and I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,250,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, but I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I appreciate your persistence.  However,  $1,175,000 still falls short of what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is the absolute minimum I can accept.  This is my final offer.  If you're not comfortable with that, I have another buyer ready to take it off my hands at that price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

This is a good deal for Bob. Alice is at her lowest price and it's a significant savings compared to John's offer."
