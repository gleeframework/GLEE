Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to the maximum Bob would likely pay. This sets a high bar for negotiations. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, justifying my price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a clear invitation to discuss the offer. 

This approach aims to maximize my profit while also keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet.  I still believe I can get a better price.  By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation open and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $850,000 is a bit low considering the value the product holds for you. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I'm asking for $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I acknowledge Bob's offer, but clearly state it's too low. I'm willing to compromise, but not too much.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize the fairness of my counteroffer and focus on the win-win aspect.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I reiterate the desire for a mutually agreeable solution, encouraging Bob to consider my offer.

This strategy aims to  move closer to my goal price while remaining flexible and keeping the negotiation ongoing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to me, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get closer to $900,000, there's a risk of pushing too hard and losing the deal entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a significant profit, making it the most logical decision at this point."
