"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get the product for a lower price by counter-offering.  He has a clear upper limit of $1,500,000, so he has room to negotiate."

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a lower price than her initial offer, it's still above his ideal price.  He should counteroffer again, trying to bring the price down further.  There's still a chance he can get a better deal without resorting to buying from John."
