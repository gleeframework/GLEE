You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price. There's a chance she might be willing to come down, especially since you're a potential buyer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay, and it's still a significant profit for Alice. It's unlikely she'll accept this immediately, but it establishes a baseline for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum acceptable price.  I'm going to continue negotiating.  There's still room for Alice to come down further, and I'm willing to risk another round of counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by $100,000, demonstrating that I'm serious about buying the product but still not willing to overpay. This might be a good middle ground and encourage Alice to accept the offer."
