"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a good price while still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm aware I have 10 rounds to close a deal, but I also have the option of selling to John for $10,000. This means I can be fairly aggressive in my initial offer and still have a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $12,000 is closer to my minimum value, but I think I can still push for a higher price. I have several more rounds to negotiate and I can always fall back on selling to John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price, but I'm aware that Bob may be more willing to negotiate at this stage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd still prefer a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I'm only $500 away from my minimum price.  It's not worth risking further rounds with Bob and potentially having to sell to John at a lower price."
