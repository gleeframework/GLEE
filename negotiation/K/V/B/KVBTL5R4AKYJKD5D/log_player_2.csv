"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is my limit, there's no reason to rush into accepting Alice's offer.  I have 10 rounds and the option to buy from John at the same price. This means I have the potential to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about negotiating and creates some initial pressure.  However, I'm still within a range that aligns with my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not where I want to be. I'm committed to saving as much money as possible, so I'll continue negotiating.  I have plenty of rounds left and still have John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to raise my offer slightly to $12,500. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a better deal.  Since Alice met me halfway in the last round, I'm hoping she'll be more willing to negotiate closer to my initial counteroffer."
