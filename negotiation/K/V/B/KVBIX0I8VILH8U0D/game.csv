"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. Considering its worth to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I could meet you halfway from our previous offers, how about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Considering the value you'll get from the product, I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,5,
