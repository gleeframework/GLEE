"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.  This is a risky strategy, but it could lead to a higher final price if Bob is eager to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While $110 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room to negotiate and I can potentially get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer, and it's still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that this will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe there's still a chance to get a better price. I'm not in a rush and want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125. This is a significant compromise, moving closer to Bob's last offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping that this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, as we are nearing the halfway point of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's very close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get a slightly higher price. There are only four rounds left, so I need to be cautious about rushing into a deal.  However, I'm also starting to get concerned about the possibility of losing out to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 122}
```

I'm offering $122. This is only $2 above my minimum acceptable price and a small compromise from my previous offer. With only a few rounds left, I need to be more aggressive. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a final offer and accept, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if this offer is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is my minimum acceptable price, and I've already rejected Bob's previous offer at this price. Accepting this offer guarantees I receive my minimum, and with only two rounds left, I risk losing the deal to John if I reject."
