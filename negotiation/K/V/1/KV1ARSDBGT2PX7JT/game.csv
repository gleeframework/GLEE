,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $120? That's my maximum budget for this.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, thanks for your interest! I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $135? That's still a good deal for you and it allows me to get closer to the value of the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $125. If we can agree on that, I'll take the product off your hands.",125.0,Bob,4,
