"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product at a price of $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? It's a great deal for a product you value at $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's price:**  $13,500 is better than the $15,000 John is offering.
* **There's little room for further negotiation:** Bob's initial counteroffer of $12,500 was rejected, and Alice is now meeting halfway. It's likely that further negotiation will only result in a small price drop, if any.

By accepting this offer, Bob can secure the product for a price that is within his budget and saves him $1,500 compared to buying from John."
