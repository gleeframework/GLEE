"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! However, $90 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I can do $100, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}"
