"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for a price of $1,400,000, which is significantly less than its true worth to me. This is a limited-time offer, so please consider it carefully. If you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a much higher price. Let me know your decision!
