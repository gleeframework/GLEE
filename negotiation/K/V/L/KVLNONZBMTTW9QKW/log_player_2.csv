"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's truly unique and I believe it can be incredibly valuable to your business. My asking price is $1,400,000. This price reflects the product's value and my need to maximize my return. I'm open to discussing your perspective and finding a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.**  
* **You have room to negotiate.**  There's a $200,000 difference between your maximum and Alice's offer. You should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this sale work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget.**  While she has come down from her initial offer, it's still $150,000 higher than your maximum. 
* **You can still negotiate.** You have room to push for a lower price, especially since you have a fallback option with John.  

**Next Steps:** You should counteroffer with a price closer to your maximum budget, ideally around $1,300,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still too far below the value I need to secure for this product.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $1,375,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.  I hope you'll reconsider and accept this offer.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's final offer is still above your maximum budget.** While she's come down significantly, it's still $75,000 more than what you're willing to pay.
* **John is offering a better deal.** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice if you can get a better price elsewhere.

**It's time to move on to a more favorable deal.**"
