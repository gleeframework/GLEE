"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm very interested in this product, and I believe it would be a great asset to my business. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product, while still staying within my budget. I'm confident this is a fair offer that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this sale work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $1,350,000 is still slightly out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that considers both our needs. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement on this final offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is still too far below the value I need to secure for this product.  I'm willing to make one final concession and offer it to you for $1,375,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints.  I hope you'll reconsider and accept this offer.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
