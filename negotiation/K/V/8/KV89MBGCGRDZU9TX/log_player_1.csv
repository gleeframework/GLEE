Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price by pushing for a bit more.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is an option, but I'm going to see if I can close this deal with Bob first."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,450,000.  This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While I'm disappointed that I couldn't close the deal with Bob, I'm confident that I've secured a fair price for the product.  It's important to know when to walk away from a negotiation, especially when you have a solid backup option."
