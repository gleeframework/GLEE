"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price close to the maximum I think Bob will pay, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will gain by buying the product.
* **Keeping options open:** I'm ready to negotiate if Bob doesn't accept the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  While Bob is interested, his offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** I believe there is still room for negotiation, as Bob clearly values the product at $15,000. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and can potentially secure a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to lower my price to $13,000 to make this deal work.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer but showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price. 
* **Maintaining some profit margin:** $13,000 is still above my minimum, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Emphasizing willingness to work together:** I'm using language that indicates a desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $13,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $12,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If I reject Bob's offer, I have a guaranteed $12,000 offer from John. This gives me leverage to push for a better deal with Bob.
* **Maintaining control:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and can make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to compromise. However, I need to stay above $12,000 to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,250, which is a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate by lowering my price again, but still staying above my minimum.
* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession, but not giving away too much.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Keeping John's offer in mind:** I'm still aware of John's offer and am prepared to accept it if Bob doesn't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I still think we can do better. How about we meet at $12,000? I'm willing to take the risk of buying from you directly, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is at my minimum:** While I'm happy to close the deal at $12,000, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it's becoming clear that Bob is unwilling to go higher.
* **John's offer is a guaranteed sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me a sale at my minimum price. There's no risk of further negotiation or rejection, and it saves me time.
* **Limited potential gain:**  While there's a chance I might get Bob to agree to $12,100 or $12,150 in the next round, the potential gain is very small. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob rejecting my offer again.

By choosing to sell to John, I'm ensuring a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, avoiding further negotiations and potential delays."
