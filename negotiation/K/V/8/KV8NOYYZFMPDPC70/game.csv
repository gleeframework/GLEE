"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. What do you think about a price of $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000, which is the price I've found from another seller. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is below my minimum.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value this product offers.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $15,000. I'd be willing to meet you at $13,500, which is closer to my budget. Would you be willing to consider that price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
