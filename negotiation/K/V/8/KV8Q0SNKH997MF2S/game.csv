"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider selling the product to me for $880,000? This would allow us to reach an agreement that is more aligned with my financial situation.",880000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. While $880,000 is tempting, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price slightly to $920,000. This would still allow me a significant return on my investment and hopefully allows you to stay within your budget. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not able to meet at $920,000. I'd like to propose $890,000 as a compromise. This price reflects the value I see in your product while keeping it within my financial limits. I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you.",890000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $890,000 is a step closer, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to my initial offer. Let's compromise at $910,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can finalize this deal.",910000.0,Alice,5,
