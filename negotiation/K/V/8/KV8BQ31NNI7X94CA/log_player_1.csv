"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value to me. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is truly significant. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low. How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000?"",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're still early in the negotiation. While Bob is moving closer to my desired price, I think there's room for him to go higher. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum, but still above John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. To make this happen, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1175000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm adding a sense of urgency. This price is still significantly above John's offer, and it gives Bob a chance to accept a price below my initial offer but above his."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,175,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider purchasing from John instead. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is using John as leverage and indicating he won't go any higher. Accepting $1,150,000 is a significant profit, and it's risky to push further. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob and settling for John's offer."
