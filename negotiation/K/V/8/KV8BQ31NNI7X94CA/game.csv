"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential value to me. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is truly significant. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is too low. How about we meet halfway at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  Let's split the difference and meet at $1,125,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer! I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. To make this happen, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This is my final offer.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but $1,175,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider purchasing from John instead.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
