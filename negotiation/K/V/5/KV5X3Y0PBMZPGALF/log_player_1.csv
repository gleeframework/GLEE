Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still only able to pay $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that you'll get a good deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.

Bob is clearly fixed on $100 and isn't budging. It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $150 from John rather than waste more time hoping Bob will drastically increase his offer."
