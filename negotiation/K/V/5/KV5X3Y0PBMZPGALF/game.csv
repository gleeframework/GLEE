,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your budget, but $200 is my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's a fantastic product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $175 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my offer of $100. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to look elsewhere.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a tighter budget.  Let's make this work. How about $160? That's my final offer, and I think it's very fair for the value you're getting.",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still only able to pay $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that you'll get a good deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",100.0,Bob,6,
