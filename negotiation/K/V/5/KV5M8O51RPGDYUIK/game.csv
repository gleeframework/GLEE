"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $10,500?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's within my budget.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,500 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to go down a little more to $11,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it still gives you a good value.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,500 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,
