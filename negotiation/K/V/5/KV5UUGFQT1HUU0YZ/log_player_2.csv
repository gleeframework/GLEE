"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's in excellent condition and I think you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $9,000 is above Bob's maximum budget. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit higher than I can go right now.  How about $7,500?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is within Bob's budget:**  $7,500 is still under Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Reasonable starting point:** It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's seriousness about negotiating.
* **Leaves room for compromise:** There's still space for Alice to come down a bit to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer, Bob still has room to try and negotiate a lower price. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $8,500 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go to $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  Bob is now at his absolute maximum price, so this is a strong indicator that he is serious about the deal.
* **Fair compromise:** $8,000 is a middle ground between Bob's previous offer and Alice's latest offer.
* **Potential for acceptance:** Alice might be willing to accept this offer, especially since it's close to her value and avoids going to John."
