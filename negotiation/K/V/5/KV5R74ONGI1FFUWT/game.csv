"Alice,  I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is above my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I can only offer $850000.  Let me know if this is something we can work with.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a great deal on a product you value. Let's find a compromise we can both agree on.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $950000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $900000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
