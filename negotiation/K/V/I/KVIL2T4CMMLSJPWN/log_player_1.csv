"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a fair starting point considering the product's value to Bob.  If he rejects, we can negotiate further. I also have John as a backup, providing me with leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't accept a price that undervalues the product.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price and reflects the value the product holds for Bob. I believe it's a fair compromise that keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not ready to sell for less than $1,000,000.  I'm confident I can get a better price with a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is my absolute minimum price, and I'm confident that Bob will accept it. I'm still considering selling to John, but I'd prefer to get the deal done with Bob if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate. Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not willing to go lower than $1,000,000.  While I would prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to risk losing the opportunity to sell for a guaranteed $1,000,000 to John."
