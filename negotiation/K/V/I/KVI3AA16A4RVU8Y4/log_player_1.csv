Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer.  If he rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to lower the price slightly in a counteroffer.  However, I won't go below my minimum of $120. If things don't work out with Bob, I can always sell to John for that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my spending within $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to give the product away. I will make a counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $92.50?  It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate your offer, but I would like to stick to my target price of $85 if possible. Would you be able to accommodate this? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on his price, and it's getting close to my minimum.  However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $120.  Since John is willing to pay that amount, I'll sell the product to him instead of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
