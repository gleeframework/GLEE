"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product at a price of $11,000. I believe this product will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price of $12,000.** 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt a counteroffer.**  There's a chance you can negotiate a lower price with Alice.
* **Buying from John is a backup option if negotiations with Alice fail.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $9,500.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your target price of $12,000.**
* **It's a good compromise.** You've successfully negotiated a lower price from her initial offer.
* **Buying from John is still an option, but Alice's offer is a better deal.**"
