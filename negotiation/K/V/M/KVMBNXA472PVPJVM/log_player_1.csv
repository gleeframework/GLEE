{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is a bit higher than my minimum, but still lower than the value to Bob. This creates a room for negotiation, without giving away too much value right away.  I'll be prepared to counter his offer, or to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than what I'm willing to accept, but it's still close enough to my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal with a counter-offer. I'll need to be careful not to push him away, though."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $125?  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $125. How about we try $115? I think that's a fair price for the product, and it's still within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is tempting, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I believe I can get closer to my desired price point. I'll reject his offer and attempt one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. $115 is still a bit lower than where I'm comfortable going. How about we compromise at $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the transaction. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $115, which is $118. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum price, and it seems he is not willing to budge further. I'd rather accept his offer and make a profit, than risk losing the deal and having to sell to John at a much lower price."
