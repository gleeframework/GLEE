"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great investment opportunity. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. What are your thoughts?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to considering your offer, Bob, but I'm still a bit above $8,750. I can do $9,250, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  If I can get it for $8,850, I'm happy to close the deal. It's a small difference, but it would make a big difference for me.  What do you say?",8850.0,Bob,6,
