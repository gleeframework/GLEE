Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial. I'm asking for $1,190,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation as possible, knowing we have John as a backup. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering slightly below Bob's $1,200,000 limit leaves room for potential counter-offers while still securing a significant profit. 
* **Confident but not Greedy:** The message aims to convey value and confidence without appearing overly aggressive, which could scare Bob away. 

By starting high but reasonable, we increase the chances of a successful negotiation with Bob while ensuring a profitable outcome regardless."
