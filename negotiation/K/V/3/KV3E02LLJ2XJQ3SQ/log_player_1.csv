{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing him to a rejection. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $11,500 is my ideal price, starting slightly higher gives me some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Alternative Option:** I have a safety net with John ($10,000), so I'm not desperate and can confidently aim high with Bob."
