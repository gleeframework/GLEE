"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is still a significant amount and reflects its value.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is considerably below what I can accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end while still reflecting the inherent value of the product.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
