"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This creates room for negotiation while ensuring I don't immediately concede too much.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and encouraging tone can help build rapport and increase the chances of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can still secure a higher price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm willing to risk further negotiation for a potential higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This reflects the unique value this product brings to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, showing a willingness to negotiate but not conceding too much. It's a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value to his business, emphasizing why it's worth a higher price. 
* **Encouraging Acceptance:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone, hoping to move the negotiation closer to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still think the product is a bit overpriced. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1350000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're already halfway through the negotiation rounds.
* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk of Further Concessions:**  Continuing to negotiate risks driving the price down further, especially if Bob keeps making low counteroffers. 
* **Guaranteed Outcome:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and a quick resolution. It's the safest and most efficient option at this point."
