"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. This product is interesting to me, but your asking price is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. While I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $1,100,000 is still a little too steep for me.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're definitely getting closer.  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I don't want to waste either of our time.  How about we settle at $800,000? That's my final offer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
