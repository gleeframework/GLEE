"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common tactic in negotiations, and it leaves room for me to negotiate downwards if needed. It also sets a strong initial point in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm aiming for a price closer to $8,000. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to move closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, though. How about $8,500? That's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $8,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your latest one. How about $8,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and potentially losing the deal altogether."
