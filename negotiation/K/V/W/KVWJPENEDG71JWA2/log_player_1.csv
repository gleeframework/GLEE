Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to sell it for $175. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:**  We know Bob values the product at $150. This gives us a baseline.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $175 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still potentially settle closer to $160-$165. 
* **Our Guaranteed Alternative:** We have John as a backup buyer at $150. There's no risk of going below this price.

**Important:** This strategy aims to maximize profit.  If we started too low (e.g., $155), Bob would likely accept immediately, leaving potential profit on the table."
