"Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you this valuable product, which I know you've been interested in. While its worth is undoubtedly high, I'm willing to sell it to you for a price that's still incredibly advantageous.  Let's discuss a price of $950,000.  This gives you a significant profit margin, and it's a deal that benefits both of us. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,1,
