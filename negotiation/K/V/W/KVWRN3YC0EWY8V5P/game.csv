,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're interested but $95 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $102?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's make this happen.",102.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I think $97 would be a fair price for the product. I hope this works for you.",97.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $97 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. How about $99? It's a great price for you, and it's just a couple of dollars from what I'm looking for. Let's close the deal.",99.0,Alice,5,
