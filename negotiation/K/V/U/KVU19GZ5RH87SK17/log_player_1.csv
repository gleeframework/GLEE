Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth more to me than Bob. This sets the negotiation in my favor, and I can always come down in price if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept such a drastic reduction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above his initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to sell for significantly less than the product's worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now closer to my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer will result in a good profit, and further negotiation might not be worth the time and effort."
