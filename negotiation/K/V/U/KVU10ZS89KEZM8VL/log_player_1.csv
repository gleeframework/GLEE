{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point because it's a bit lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  This way, I can see if Bob is interested and potentially  increase the price if he's willing to pay more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $90 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95?  That way, we both get a fair price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I'm glad we're able to discuss this further. I'd like to propose $92 as my offer. This still keeps my budget in mind while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$92 is still below my ideal price, but it's getting closer to my minimum of $120.  Since I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
