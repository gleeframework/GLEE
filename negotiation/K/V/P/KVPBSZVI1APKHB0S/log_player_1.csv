Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This is a high starting price, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit. By offering a price significantly higher than your minimum, it allows for a good margin for both you and Bob to potentially agree on a price that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is significantly higher than John's, it is still lower than the initial offer. We should reject this offer and counter-offer at a price closer to our initial offer. This will demonstrate that we are willing to negotiate but also that we value the product highly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 980000}
```

This counter-offer is a compromise that shows we're willing to negotiate, but still maintains a price that's closer to our initial offer and allows for a healthy profit. This leaves room for further negotiation while also demonstrating that we are serious about getting a price closer to what we believe the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now very close to our initial counter-offer. We've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and further back-and-forth might not lead to a significantly higher price. Accepting this offer will ensure a good profit while avoiding the risk of a prolonged negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John."
