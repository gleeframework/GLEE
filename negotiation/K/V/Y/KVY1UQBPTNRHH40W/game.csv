"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your initial offer is far above my budget.  I'm interested in this product but can't afford that price point.  Let's start with a more realistic offer. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,900,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial price. To be frank, $1,200,000 is still quite a ways off from what I consider fair.  However, I'm motivated to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This is a significant concession on my end, and I hope it demonstrates my commitment to finding a solution.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer is getting closer, but I'm still not there yet.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's close the deal and move forward.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close. I understand this is a big decision for you. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $1,550,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product. Let's shake hands and make this happen.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,550,000 is still out of reach for me. I'm willing to offer you $1,500,000, which is my absolute limit.  This is a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair price given the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal now and avoid any further delays.",1500000.0,Bob,8,
