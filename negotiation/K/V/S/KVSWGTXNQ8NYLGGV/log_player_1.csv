Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is good, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell for that price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer."

Bob is still offering too low. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to drop below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to reach a compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However,  $950,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference and meet at $1,000,000.
