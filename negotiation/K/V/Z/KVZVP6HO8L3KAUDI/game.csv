"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an amazing opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I'm looking for $12000 for it. I think it's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10500? It's a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I think it's a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9800?",9800.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. How about we meet at $10200? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a great value for what you'll be getting.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $9500, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can meet you at $10000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. It's a fair price for the product, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",10000.0,Alice,7,
