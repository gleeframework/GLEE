"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still getting the product. 
* **Alice's offer:** $140, which is above Bob's maximum budget.
* **John's offer:**  $150, which is Bob's maximum budget.

**Strategy:** 
It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price. Bob can still get the product from John for $150 if he doesn't reach an agreement with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $130. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still getting the product. 
* **Alice's offer:** $140, which is still too high.
* **John's offer:** $150, which is Bob's maximum budget, but not ideal.

**Strategy:**
By offering $130, Bob is testing the waters and seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate. This is a reasonable counteroffer that is still below Alice's value of the product but closer to Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still getting the product. 
* **Alice's offer:** $135, which is within Bob's budget and a good compromise.
* **John's offer:** $150, which is Bob's maximum budget, but not ideal.

**Strategy:** 
Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. Accepting this offer allows Bob to get the product for a lower price than John's offer and saves him $15."
