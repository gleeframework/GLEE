Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $100. I believe it offers great value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason (""great value"") might make Bob more amenable to the offer, even if it's slightly above his valuation. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message implies I'm willing to discuss the price further, depending on Bob's response.

By starting high, I increase the chances of settling closer to my desired profit margin while still allowing flexibility to reach a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good offer and above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message implies he's still interested, but trying to get a better price. I'll counter with a price slightly above my minimum to entice him while still aiming for a higher profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your position, but I'm confident in the value of this product. How about we meet in the middle at $95?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By suggesting ""meeting in the middle"", I signal a willingness to negotiate and make a deal.
* **Above Minimum:** $95 is still a $15 profit for me, exceeding my minimum sale price.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Not dropping the price significantly might encourage Bob to accept before I potentially decide to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $90 would be a fair price for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might alienate Bob, and the potential profit gained by holding out for a higher price is shrinking. 
* **Solid Profit:** $90 is still a $10 profit, which is a reasonable return.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a chance Bob could walk away entirely if I counter again, leaving me to sell to John for $80. Accepting now guarantees a profit."
