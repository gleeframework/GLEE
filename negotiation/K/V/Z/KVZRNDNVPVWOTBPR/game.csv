"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $9,500? I believe that's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. This is the minimum price I need to make this deal work for me. If you're willing to meet me at $10,000, I'm willing to consider it.",10000.0,Alice,5,
