"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. This product is worth $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. It's a steal!  Let me know if you're interested, but act fast, as I have another buyer ready to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing.** She claims to have another buyer for $800,000, which is her own valuation of the product. It's unlikely she'd sell it for a loss.
* **You have a better alternative.** John offers the product for $1,000,000, which is your maximum price.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you call her bluff and open the possibility of negotiating a lower price. Even if she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John."
