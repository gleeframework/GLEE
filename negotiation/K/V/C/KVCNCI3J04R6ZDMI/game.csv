"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1050000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working within a budget, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1100000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but I need you to meet me there. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. Can you consider my revised offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I've already met you at $1100000 and you countered at $1050000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm willing to go down to $1075000, which is a compromise between our last two offers. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but I need you to meet me there. I'm not willing to go above that price. Can you consider my revised offer?",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I've been flexible with you, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where I need to consider other options. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it. I'm willing to meet you at $1060000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to explore other opportunities.",1060000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I've been patient and flexible, but I'm starting to feel like we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one last attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I need to be clear that I'm not willing to go any lower than $1070000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options. Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.",1070000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm at my absolute limit. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but I need you to meet me there. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $1200000. Please let me know if this is something we can work with.",1050000.0,Bob,10,
