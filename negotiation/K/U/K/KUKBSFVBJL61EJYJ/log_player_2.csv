Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000, but I can also offer a compromise at $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.
