"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'm looking for. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This reflects the value you've stated and leaves some room for us both to be happy. Let's meet in the middle on this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,100,000. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000, which is closer to your offer and meets my minimum. Let's finalize this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
