"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and finalize this deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the negotiations we've had so far. Would you be willing to consider my offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to go down to $15,500. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and it's a price that reflects the product's value and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's make this deal happen.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $14,500, which is the highest I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle and finalize the deal.",14500.0,Bob,6,
