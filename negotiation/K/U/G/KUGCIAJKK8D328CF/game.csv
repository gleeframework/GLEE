"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $750,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for it. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $725,000, which is still a great deal for you, but also reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $725,000 is closer to my range, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I'm happy to offer $700,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable deal. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll consider $712,500, which is a fair price that reflects the product's value. What do you think?",712500.0,Alice,5,
