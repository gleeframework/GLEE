(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer is $950,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. 
* While Alice's offer is a little better than John's, it's still not within Bob's acceptable price range. 

Therefore, Bob should reject Alice's offer and explore other options."
