"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is still a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $10,500. This is the best I can do, considering the value I've attached to it.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  I think that's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. This is the minimum price I'm comfortable with, considering the value I've attached to the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you a compromise at $10,750. This is the best I can do.",10750.0,Alice,5,
