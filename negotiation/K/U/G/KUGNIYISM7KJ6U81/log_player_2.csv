# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering the market value is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

While $10,000 is a decent price, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal. You can always fall back on buying from John for $12,000 if needed."
