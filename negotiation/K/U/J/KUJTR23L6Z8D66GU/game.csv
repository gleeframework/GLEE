"I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $120 is lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? This is still a great deal for a product of this quality.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $140 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. That's the lowest I can go.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $130 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm willing to make this final concession to get this deal done.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. That's the best I can do.",125.0,Bob,6,
