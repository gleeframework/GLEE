"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
Thanks for the offer Alice.  $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think!,105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal.  What do you say?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $108.75? This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?",108.75,Alice,5,
