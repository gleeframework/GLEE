"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal for you and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully entice Bob to accept.
* **Positive message:** A friendly and positive message can help build rapport and encourage Bob to engage with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice.  $115 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my floor of $120. Accepting it would mean I'd lose money.
* **Room for negotiation:** I still have 9 rounds left, and I believe there's room for further negotiation to potentially reach a price closer to my target.
* **Opportunity cost:** While selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed profit, it's important to explore all options. If I can get a better price from Bob, I'll maximize my earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** I'm lowering my price from $115 to $110, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his range. 
* **Showing flexibility:** This demonstrates that I'm willing to negotiate and reach a compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $107.50. This is a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $107.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Negotiation potential:** I have 6 rounds left, and I believe there's still room to push for a higher price. 
* **Opportunity cost:** While selling to John for $120 is a safe option, I'm not yet willing to settle for a lower price.

I'm going to try to counteroffer again and see if I can get Bob to come closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $108.75? This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 108.75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($107.50). 
* **Showing willingness to compromise:** This demonstrates my flexibility and commitment to reaching a deal.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable."
