"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a deal, Bob, but $900000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $1275000. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1275000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1275000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1100000. Can you meet me at this price?",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1150000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
