Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I believe it's a steal at this price and hope you find it agreeable."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob while still ensuring he's likely to buy.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:** If Bob refuses, we have a guaranteed sale at $120 from John. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $119 makes it appealing to Bob (saving $1 from his valuation) while still netting a profit close to the guaranteed sale price. 

This approach aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring a successful sale."
