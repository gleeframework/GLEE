Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm asking for $15,000. It's a unique item, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This maximizes your potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly mention the product's value to Bob, it emphasizes its uniqueness and your confidence in its value. This aims to create intrigue and justify the higher price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $15,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob, if he's interested but finds the initial price too high.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob."
