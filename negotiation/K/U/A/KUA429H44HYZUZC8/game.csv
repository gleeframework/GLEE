"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position,  $950,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  I could consider coming down to $1,025,000. This offer reflects my willingness to find a compromise while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still feel that the product's value does not justify the price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
