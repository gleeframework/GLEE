Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring I get a good price. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed backup buyer at $800,000, so I can afford to be somewhat aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my ideal price of $1,000,000. I'll counter with a lower offer, but still above John's price, to see if I can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves some room for me to potentially get a higher price if Bob is very motivated."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a bit more, $920,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to haggle.  It's a significant improvement over John's offer, and I'm happy to close the deal."
