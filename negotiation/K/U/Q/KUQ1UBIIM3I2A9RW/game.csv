"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and the price you mentioned earlier.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $900000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to achieve a price that reflects the true potential value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This price would still be quite beneficial for both of us and allows us to move forward with this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $1000000. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high, as I believe the market value of the product is closer to $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I think this is a fair compromise that would allow us to reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
