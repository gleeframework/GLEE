Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a middle ground that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from my initial offer, but it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems like we're getting stuck.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John than to risk further rounds of negotiation with Bob."
