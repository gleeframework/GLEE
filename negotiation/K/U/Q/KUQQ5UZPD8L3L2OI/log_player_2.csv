{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than the $10,000 John is offering, Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice.  He should reject her initial offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to Alice's valuation of $8,000 as possible while still ensuring he saves a significant amount compared to John's offer.  $8,500 represents a good starting point for negotiation, offering Alice a reasonable profit while still saving Bob $1,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can still likely do better. He's already shown his willingness to negotiate and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  A counteroffer will allow Bob to continue pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. He's moved up from his previous offer of $8,500, showing willingness to compromise, but still keeping the price lower than Alice's current offer of $9,000. This gives Alice room to feel like she's getting a better deal than her initial valuation, while still giving Bob a significant saving."
