I'm starting with a price of $9,500.  This is a good starting point because it's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to maximize my profit, but I also want to be reasonable and avoid losing the deal entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, I believe I can still do better.  $8,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still a bit low considering the product is worth $10,000 to him. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility.  It's also still a good price for me, as it's well above my minimum acceptable price.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this offer and be willing to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is getting closer to my desired price. It's still not ideal, but it's a better deal than selling to John for $8,000. I'm confident that I can't squeeze much more out of Bob, so I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
