Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go above $15,000, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,750 and $15,000. I can offer it to you for $14,875. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.

``` 

Alice is clearly holding firm around that $15,000 mark.  While it's tempting to try for a slightly lower price, it's not worth the risk of her backing out and losing the deal. Accepting $14,875 ensures you get a discount and avoid the risk of John's offer no longer being available."
