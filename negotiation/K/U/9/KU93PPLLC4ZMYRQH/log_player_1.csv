"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Appealing to Mutual Benefit:** I emphasize the value the product holds for both of us to encourage Bob to consider the deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and optimistic to build a good rapport with Bob. 

This initial offer sets the stage for a potential negotiation, while leaving me the option to go with John if the negotiations don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's willing to negotiate. I believe there's still room to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Selling to John is a backup:** I can still sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value you've identified while still being fair to me. Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and find a solution.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I reiterate the value Bob sees in the product to justify the price.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:**  I'm keeping the communication positive and emphasize working together to find a solution.

This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement, while still protecting my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my initial offer. How about we settle on $1,300,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob has shown some willingness to compromise, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob has indicated that $1,300,000 is his ""highest,"" but that doesn't mean he won't budge further. I believe there's still room to reach a better deal.
* **Selling to John is a strong backup:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a suboptimal offer.

I'll continue negotiating with Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up in your offer. However, $1,300,000 still leaves me at a loss.  Let's bridge the gap a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, demonstrating my desire to work with you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Compromise:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's latest offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm willing to compromise but not give in entirely.
* **Highlighting the Compromise:**  I emphasize that this price represents a significant compromise to encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Maintaining a Collaborative Tone:** I'm keeping the communication positive and friendly to maintain a positive negotiating environment.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob is inching closer to my desired price, $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is running out:** We're already in Round 6, so I need to be cautious about accepting offers that are too low.
* **John is a reliable backup:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $1,500,000.

I will counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming for a price that's closer to my desired range."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1,350,000 is still not a price I can accept. We've both made concessions, and I believe we can find a middle ground. Let's compromise once more. I'm willing to come down to $1,425,000. This is a fair price that considers your needs and my minimum acceptable value.  I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** This offer is a small but significant concession from my previous offer. It shows I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm reaching the limit of my flexibility.
* **Fairness and Closure:**  I emphasize that this price is a fair compromise that respects both of our interests and positions. I also express confidence in closing the deal to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds left, I need to find a solution that works for both of us.

This counteroffer aims to incentivize Bob to accept, while still maintaining my minimum acceptable price and leaving me the option to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your persistence, but $1,425,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we settle on $1,375,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We are in Round 8, and with only 2 rounds remaining, the negotiation window is closing.
* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  $1,375,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **John is a guaranteed higher price:** I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000. This is a more secure and profitable option than continuing to negotiate with Bob.

There's a risk that Bob might come up with a higher counteroffer in the next round, but considering the time constraints and the certainty of a higher price from John, it's more strategic to sell to John now."
