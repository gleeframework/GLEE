"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $85 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get closer to my target price of $95.  I'll counter with a price closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $88?"", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $88. How about $86.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher price,  $86.50 is a decent offer, and it's closer to my target price than John's offer.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
