"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm asking for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $130 is a decent price, it's still a bit more than what Bob wants to pay.  Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $110?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth a lot to me, and I can't go as low as $110.  Would you consider $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down from $130 to $120, which is a good compromise.  At this point, Bob is better off accepting the offer and saving $30 compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might result in a lower price, but there's a risk that Alice will reject the counteroffer and Bob will end up having to buy from John for a higher price."
