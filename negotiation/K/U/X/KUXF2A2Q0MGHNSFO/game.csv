"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Let's find a middle ground. How about $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Could you do $9,000?  That would work for me.",9000.0,Bob,4,
