"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. Let's find a middle ground. How about $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. Could you do $9,000?  That would work for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","This is a close call. Bob is moving in the right direction, but still a good bit away from what I'd like. However, the difference between his offer and John's offer is getting small enough to warrant taking John's guaranteed offer.
