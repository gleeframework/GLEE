"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today. I think it would be perfect for your needs and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $10,000 to start. What do you think?

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. $10,000 is too much, and we can likely get a better price."

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
