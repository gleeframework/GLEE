Round 2
Bob's offer:

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,400,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? I'm confident this product will be worth every penny to you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,350,000 and $1,400,000, so how about $1,375,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a significant profit and is getting closer to my initial asking price.  The risk of continuing the negotiation is that Bob might become less interested, and I could end up selling to John for less."
