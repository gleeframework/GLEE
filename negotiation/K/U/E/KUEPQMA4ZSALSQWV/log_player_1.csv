"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,150,000. It's a steal considering its value to you!  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is a good price, I believe I can get closer to my target of $1,200,000. I have 8 rounds left and John's offer is my safety net if things don't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering it to you for $1,125,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,125,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,080,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $1,080,000 is still quite a bit lower than my target. I have 6 rounds left, and John's offer is a good backup.  I want to try to get a better deal with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, but this is my final offer. This product is truly valuable for you, and this price reflects that.  If you're serious about this deal, let's agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,070,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to sell to John.  With only 4 rounds left, and Bob continually offering less, I'm not confident I can get a significantly better deal.  Selling to John secures me a solid profit, and it's better than risking getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
