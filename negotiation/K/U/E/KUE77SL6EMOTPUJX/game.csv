"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a discounted price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you the product for $11,200. This is still a great value for the product, and I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
