{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $95 is too high, and I can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

$90 is still a bit too high for me. I'll see if I can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. How about $88?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $92.50, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not ready to accept.  I'll see if I can get her down to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it, and I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already offered you $92.50, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I think it's a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm going to have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is being stubborn and not willing to budge on the price. I've already made several counteroffers and it seems unlikely she will go lower. It's better to just buy from John for $100 and avoid further negotiation."
