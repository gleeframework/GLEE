Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $110 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on it while still exceeding your minimum price. 

This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you get a good deal even if Bob tries to haggle."
