Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this is a very competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below her minimum ($12,000). 
* **Create Urgency:** By offering a ""very competitive price"" and highlighting the product's benefits, Alice might persuade Bob to act quickly.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can still sell to John at her minimum acceptable price."
