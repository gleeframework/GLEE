"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price. It also sets the tone for a serious negotiation, demonstrating my confidence in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, and I'm confident I can get more.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price.  There's still plenty of room to work with, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price so early in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering with $1,200,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation and is closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  This price point also reflects the product's value to me while trying to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want it to be. I'm going to reject his offer and continue to negotiate. I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired price, and I'm not willing to settle for less just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,100,000. This is a further compromise on my side, showing my willingness to reach an agreement. It's also a reasonable price point considering the value of the product to me and Bob's previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal for me. Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, and I'm confident that I won't be able to get a better offer from him. It's also a much better price than what John is offering."
