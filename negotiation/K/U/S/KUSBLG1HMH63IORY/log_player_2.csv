"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Given its potential, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 500000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm beginning with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This establishes a strong negotiating position and leaves room for me to increase my offer gradually.
* **Respectful Tone:**  I want to maintain a positive and respectful tone with Alice throughout the negotiation. 
* **Clear Goal:** My ultimate goal is to pay significantly less than $1,000,000. By starting low, I signal my intention to negotiate a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and  $500,000 is considerably below its worth.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we consider a price of $1,200,000? This feels like a fairer reflection of its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle on $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 750000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:** I'm increasing my offer, but not dramatically. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm serious about getting a lower price.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** I'm aiming for a price that's roughly in the middle of our previous offers. This signals my willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Alice to do the same.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  This gives me a firm walk-away point in the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer. Let's make this happen - I can come down to $1,000,000 even.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Limit:** Alice has signaled that $1,000,000 is her absolute lowest price. It's unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **Equivalent Offer:** John is offering the product for the same price as Alice.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing to negotiate with Alice carries the risk that she'll sell to her other interested buyer. Buying from John guarantees I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
