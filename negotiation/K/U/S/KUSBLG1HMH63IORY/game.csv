"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and  $500,000 is considerably below its worth.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we consider a price of $1,200,000? This feels like a fairer reflection of its value.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle on $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're getting closer. Let's make this happen - I can come down to $1,000,000 even.  This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
