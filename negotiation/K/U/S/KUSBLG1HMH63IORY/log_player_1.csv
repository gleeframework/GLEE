I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and John's standing offer.  It's too big a gap to accept. I need to counter, but leave myself room to negotiate.

{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and  $500,000 is considerably below its worth.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we consider a price of $1,200,000? This feels like a fairer reflection of its value."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,200,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle on $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.
