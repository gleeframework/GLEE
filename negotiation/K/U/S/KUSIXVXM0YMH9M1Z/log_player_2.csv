# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. What are your thoughts?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your budget constraints. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for being transparent about your limit, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product for $1,050,000. This is as close as I can get to your limit while still ensuring I earn a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and this price is a significant savings from both her starting offer and John's price.  Taking the deal now secures the product at a good price."
