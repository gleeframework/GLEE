Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product which I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $95, which reflects its true worth."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out.  However, $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to offer $85 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
