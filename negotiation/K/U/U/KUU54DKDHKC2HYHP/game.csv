"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your expertise, and I wouldn't part with it for anything less than $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit steep at $950,000. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize you see the value,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the unique benefits this product offers. I could consider letting it go for $925,000.  This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product and what it can do for your business. I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000. This is my final offer, Bob.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to come down, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000. Can you consider this revised offer?",880000.0,Bob,6,
