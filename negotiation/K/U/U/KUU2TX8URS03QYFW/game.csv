"I understand you have a budget in mind, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. I can see you're interested in the product, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7000 and $8200. How about $8100?",8100.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7600. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to make sure I'm making a fair profit. How about we meet at $7900?",7900.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $7800, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that's the best price for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we meet at $7950?",7950.0,Alice,9,
