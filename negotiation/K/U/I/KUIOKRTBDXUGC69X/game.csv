"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay up to $12000 for it. Could you consider my offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I value your willingness to negotiate, $12000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $13500. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. Would you be willing to meet me at $12800? I'm willing to make a slightly higher offer to show my interest in the product, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget.",12800.0,Bob,4,
