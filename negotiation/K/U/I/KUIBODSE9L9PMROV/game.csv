"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it could bring to my business. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and I'm glad you're enthusiastic about its potential value to your business. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $1200000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for it.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer and meeting me halfway, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1300000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm thinking of a price of $1350000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $1290000. I believe this is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope you can understand my position. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1000000. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer.",1290000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to make one final offer. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1290000. I believe the product's value is worth more than that, and I'm not willing to sell it to you for less than $1320000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",1320000.0,Alice,7,
