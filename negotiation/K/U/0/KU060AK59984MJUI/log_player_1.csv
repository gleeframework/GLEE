"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy.  I'm asking for $110 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I'm happy to negotiate,  $90 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your understanding, Alice. I'm still interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more.  I'm only a few rounds in, and John is still a viable option, so there's no reason to settle just yet.  I'll counter again and see if I can get to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're making progress!  I understand your position, but $95 just isn't quite there yet.  Let's aim for a middle ground.  How about $98? It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $98 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $92 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and while Bob's offer of $92 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  Rather than risk further rounds of negotiation with a potentially stubborn buyer, I'm going to take the guaranteed $100 offer from John.  He's a reliable buyer, and I'm confident that he'll make the purchase.  It's not the highest price I could have hoped for, but it's better than settling for less than my minimum."
