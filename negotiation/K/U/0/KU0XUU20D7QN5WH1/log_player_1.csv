Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($800,000) as possible while still exceeding what John will pay.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting in the middle. 
* **Create Urgency:** By emphasizing exclusivity and a limited-time offer, we encourage Bob to act quickly.

This approach aims for a win-win: Bob gets the product at a price potentially lower than my fallback, and I maximize my profit beyond my guaranteed sale."
