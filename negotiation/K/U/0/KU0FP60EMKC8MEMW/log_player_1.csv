"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit.
* My message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to start the negotiation on a positive note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* I have room for negotiation and can likely get closer to my desired price. 
* Selling to John for $120 guarantees my minimum acceptable profit, but I'd prefer to see if I can get closer to that amount through further negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I'd love to meet your price,  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm counter-offering with a price in the middle of our two previous offers. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise. 
* My message remains friendly and focuses on the benefits for both of us, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. 
* This price is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it gives us a reasonable starting point for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again. How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* I have several rounds left and can likely get a better offer by continuing to negotiate with Bob. 
* Selling to John for $120 guarantees my minimum acceptable profit, but I'm still hoping to get closer to that amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about $98?  It's a small step closer to your price, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 98} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. This shows continued flexibility and a desire to close the deal.
* My message remains friendly and highlights the benefit of reaching an agreement for both of us.
* I'm trying to signal to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to go below a certain price.
* This offer should put some pressure on Bob to accept or make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
