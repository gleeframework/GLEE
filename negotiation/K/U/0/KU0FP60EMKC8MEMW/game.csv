"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  While I'd love to meet your price,  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me some breathing room.  What do you say?",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you in the middle again. How about $95?  It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about $98?  It's a small step closer to your price, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",98.0,Alice,5,
