Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You'll sell for no less than $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Potential Profit:** There's a potential $200,000 profit margin for Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob feels like he's getting a good deal (so he doesn't walk away).  Offering a price slightly below his maximum value achieves this.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I know its value to someone like you, and I'm prepared to offer it at a price that reflects a mutually beneficial deal: $1,150,000.  I'm confident this will be a wise investment on your end."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Positioning the offer as ""exclusive"" adds perceived value.
* **Acknowledging Value:**  You're subtly acknowledging you know it's worth a lot to Bob.
* **""Mutually Beneficial"":**  Frames the negotiation as a win-win.
* **Strategic Price:**  $1,150,000 gives Bob a $50,000 gain and you a $150,000 gain. 
* **Confidence:**  Ending with confidence subtly implies this is a take-it-or-leave-it offer. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. You have to weigh the potential for a higher profit against the guaranteed sale to John."
