"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Appealing to Bob's value:** I'm highlighting the value the product offers to Bob, reinforcing his motivation to buy.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This offer is still lower than Bob's perceived value, creating an opportunity for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value vs. Risk:** While Bob's offer is still lower than my initial asking price, it's significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate risks further lowering the price or wasting time.
* **Opportunity Cost:** The longer I negotiate, the more likely I am to miss out on other potential buyers. Accepting this offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
