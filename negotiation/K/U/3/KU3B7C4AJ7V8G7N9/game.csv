"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? It's still a great deal for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $6,500. Would that be possible?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to get as close to your target as possible, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,500. How about we compromise at $7,500? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",7500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement on the price, but at this point $7,500 is still above my limit. I'm happy to pay $7,000, but any higher and I'll need to consider my other option.",7000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $7,000 and my original offer of $12,000. How about we compromise at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,7,
