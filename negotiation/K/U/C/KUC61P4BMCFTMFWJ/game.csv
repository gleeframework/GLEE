"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit high for me right now. Given my budget and the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering both of our needs.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I believe the product offers even greater value than your offer reflects.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's true worth while still recognizing your budget considerations.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the product's value, $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Let's try $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to move forward.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find common ground. To show my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. I believe this price accurately represents the product's value and provides you with a significant return on your investment.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
