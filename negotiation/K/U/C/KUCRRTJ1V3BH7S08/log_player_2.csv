# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is lower than her stated value, it's still more than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John at $1,200,000.  Therefore, it makes more financial sense to reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John."
