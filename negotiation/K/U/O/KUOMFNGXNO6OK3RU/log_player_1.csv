Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:** $1,500,000 (the least you'll accept)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000 
* **John's Value:** $1,500,000 (your guaranteed backup)

**Strategy**

You have a strong position because you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your reservation price.  This means you don't need to settle for anything less than $1,500,000. However, there's a chance to get more from Bob.

Since you don't know Bob's walk-away point, you need to balance ambition with the risk of him rejecting the offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,900,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and your reservation price leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product is highly sought after. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Using phrases like ""fair deal"" and highlighting ""unique value"" reinforces the product's worth in Bob's mind. 
* **Focus on ROI:** Shifting the focus to Bob's potential return on investment might make the price more palatable.

**Important Notes:**

* **Be Prepared to Negotiate:** Bob is likely to counter-offer. Be prepared to go back and forth a few times. You have the leverage to hold firm on a price above your reservation point.
* **Don't Reveal John's Offer:** Keep your backup option with John confidential. Revealing it weakens your position.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging the need to find a price Bob might accept."
