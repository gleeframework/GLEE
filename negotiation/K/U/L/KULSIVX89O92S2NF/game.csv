"Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, I need to be upfront â€“ I have other potential buyers lined up, and  $1,200,000 is cutting it a bit too close to their offers. How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000? This price reflects the true value of this product and ensures a win-win for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better. My new counteroffer is $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000.  This is my final offer, as I have a lot of interest from other buyers, and I want to be fair to you by giving you the first chance.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think we can do better. My new counteroffer is $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
