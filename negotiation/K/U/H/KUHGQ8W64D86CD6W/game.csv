,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $165 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $157.50?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",157.5,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! I can do $162.50, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.",162.5,Alice,5,
