Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price, hoping to get the full value for my product.  If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}
```

I'm willing to come down a little bit, but I'm still trying to maximize my profit. I believe $9,800 is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting lower, and I'm concerned I might not be able to get a price closer to my desired value. Since John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's safer to sell to him and guarantee the desired profit."
