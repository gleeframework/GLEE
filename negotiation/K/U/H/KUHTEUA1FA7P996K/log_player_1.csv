"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
 I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. I'm confident I can get closer to that value with further negotiation.  I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum. I'm hoping this counteroffer will show him that I'm willing to compromise, while still securing a good price for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price. I'd rather try to get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation with Bob. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway.  $10,500 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to come down to $10,750.  This is a fair price that considers both of our needs.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still holding firm on getting a price that is above my minimum. I believe this counteroffer is a reasonable compromise and will hopefully convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still trying to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $10,200 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum, but I'm starting to feel like I'm losing time and potentially risking a sale altogether.  Given that John is willing to pay my full asking price, I'm going to go ahead and sell the product to him."
