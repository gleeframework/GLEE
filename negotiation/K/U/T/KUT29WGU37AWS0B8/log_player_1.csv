{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation but below your minimum acceptable price:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to make a profit.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It's not too aggressive, giving Bob the impression that you're open to negotiation.

It's important to remember that this is just the first offer. You can adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and the information you gather during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I've done some research and I think that's a fair price for it. Can you meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95, which still leaves me a bit of room for profit.  I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $95, so I'm offering $87.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $87.50 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my acceptable threshold. I'm going to reject his offer and try for a better price.  The negotiation is getting closer, and I have a good chance of securing a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $87.50 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $90, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment at that price.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $90 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $85. That's as low as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, Bob's offer of $85 is still too low.  It's time to move on and sell to John for $120.  This guarantees me a higher profit, and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future if I need to."
