"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its high quality and unique features, it's valued at $150 by us. Considering its worth to you might be around $80, I'm proposing a fair deal where you could acquire this product for $120. This price not only reflects its value but also allows for a reasonable profit for us. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer is lower than her stated value, it's still significantly higher than your $80 limit and what John is offering. You have a better alternative."
