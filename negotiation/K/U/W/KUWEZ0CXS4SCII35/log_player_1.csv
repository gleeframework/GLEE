{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a decent discount from his perceived value of $1,200,000 while still giving me a profit significantly higher than my minimum of $1,000,000. It's a starting point for negotiation, and I'm ready to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more around $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further but I need to make a counteroffer to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still offers you a good deal, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000. This is the highest I can go, but I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price, and while I would prefer to get closer to my desired price, I also need to consider the risk of losing the deal entirely.  By accepting Bob's offer, I guarantee myself a sale and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation.  Furthermore, continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a prolonged process and the potential of John's offer becoming less attractive."
