"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price point is a little high for me.  How about we settle around $900,000? ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? This recognizes the product's worth while still providing you with a great deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. While I agree the product is good, $1,075,000 is still a bit steep for me. Could you consider $950,000? I think that's a fair offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to a fair price, I can't accept anything below $1,025,000. This is my final offer, as I know I have other interested buyers.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
