"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the value I'm seeing in the product, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This seems fair considering the potential we both see.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true worth and potential this product offers. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
