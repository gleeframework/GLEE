Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without losing him as a buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $115 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer and still allows me to make a profit above my minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have the security of John's offer ($100), so I'm not desperate and can afford to negotiate strategically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $105?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($100). 
* **Room for Compromise:** There's a $10 difference between his offer and my initial asking price. I believe a compromise can be reached.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm not in a rush. I can afford to negotiate a bit more since I have John's offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  By suggesting $110, I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer ($115) and his counteroffer ($105). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain Profit:** This price point still earns me a $10 profit over my minimum acceptable price.
* **Gauge Seriousness:**  Bob's response to this offer will indicate how interested he truly is and help me decide my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $110 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $107.50?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Profit:** $107.50 is a reasonable profit, exceeding my minimum price of $100. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might frustrate Bob and lead him to walk away.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal now means I get paid sooner. 

While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the potential gain is small compared to the risk of losing Bob as a buyer altogether."
