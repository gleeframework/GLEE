It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  $120 is a good starting point, but you can likely get it lower."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

$110 is a good price for you, and it's within your budget. There's always a risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer, and it's getting closer to your $150 limit."
