"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice saves you money:**  Alice's offer of $900,000 is cheaper than John's offer of $1,000,000. 
* **You still get a good deal:**  While you're paying more than Alice's value ($800,000), you're getting the product for less than your maximum budget ($1,000,000)."
