"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,400,000. This represents a significant value proposition for you, as you've indicated it's worth $1,200,000 to your company.  While I'm confident in selling it for my desired price, I'd prefer to prioritize a mutually beneficial partnership if possible.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth to her, it's still more expensive than your alternative option. You can buy the product from John for $1,200,000, saving you $200,000.  You should reject Alice's offer and proceed with purchasing from John."
