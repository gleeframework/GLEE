You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John, so it makes no sense to accept Alice's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob should offer a price that is lower than his maximum budget of $10,000 but still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This is a good starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he can get the product from John for $10,000, Alice's offer of $11,000 is still within his budget and saves him the hassle of further negotiation."
