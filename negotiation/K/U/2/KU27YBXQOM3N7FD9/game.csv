"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. To make this deal work, I'm willing to pay $800,000. This would be a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
