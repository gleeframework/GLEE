"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. To make this deal work, I'm willing to pay $800,000. This would be a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
