Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

This is a high opening offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to remember I'm aiming for as much as possible, while keeping the deal potentially attractive to Bob.  The goal is to create a negotiation where I can eventually get to a price that is acceptable to both of us."

Round 2

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $975,000 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a good opportunity for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was aiming for a higher price, $1,025,000 is a good deal. It's more than what John is offering, and it's getting close to my minimum acceptable value.  It's important to avoid being too stubborn and risk losing a potentially good deal."
