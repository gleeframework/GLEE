Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep the price within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $1200000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,200,000 doesn't reflect the full value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could we discuss a price closer to $1100000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both parties.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm starting to run out of time, I'm not willing to drop the price to $1,100,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'll also start considering selling to John if I don't see a better deal from Bob soon."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still interested in working with you, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't cover my costs. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,250,000. It's a reasonable compromise and still allows you to make a profit. Time is running out, so I hope we can reach an agreement soon."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort in finding a middle ground, Alice. While $1250000 is closer to my budget, I still feel there's room for further negotiation. Could we consider $1150000 as a potential price for the product?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not convinced it's a good enough deal considering the value of the product and the fact that I could sell to John for $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, but I'm also starting to seriously consider selling to John if we can't reach a mutually agreeable price soon."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,150,000.  Considering the time remaining, I'm willing to make a final concession.  Let's settle at $1,200,000. This price reflects the value of the product and ensures we both walk away with a positive outcome.  It's now or never, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is still below my minimum and I'm not sure we'll reach an agreement.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $1,200,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than risking losing more time and getting a worse deal."
