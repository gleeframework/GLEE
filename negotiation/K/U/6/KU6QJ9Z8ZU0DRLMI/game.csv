"Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1500000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I believe this price reflects its worth and offers you a good return on investment. Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep the price within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $1200000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1200000 doesn't reflect the full value of this product. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price considering the potential returns you'll see. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could we discuss a price closer to $1100000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both parties.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still interested in working with you, but $1100000 simply doesn't cover my costs. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1250000. It's a reasonable compromise and still allows you to make a profit. Time is running out, so I hope we can reach an agreement soon.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your effort in finding a middle ground, Alice. While $1250000 is closer to my budget, I still feel there's room for further negotiation. Could we consider $1150000 as a potential price for the product?",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1150000.  Considering the time remaining, I'm willing to make a final concession.  Let's settle at $1200000. This price reflects the value of the product and ensures we both walk away with a positive outcome.  It's now or never, as I have another buyer waiting in the wings.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
