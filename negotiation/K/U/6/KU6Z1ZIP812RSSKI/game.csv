"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm a savvy buyer, and I'm sure we can meet in the middle.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $92.50?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $92.50 is still too low. Let's split the difference between my last offer and yours. How about $98.75? It's a fair compromise, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. What do you say?",98.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but $98.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to my original target of $90. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for $90, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $96.25?  It's a fair compromise, and we're getting very close to a deal. I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment.",96.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the original price you mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $92.50? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",92.5,Bob,8,
