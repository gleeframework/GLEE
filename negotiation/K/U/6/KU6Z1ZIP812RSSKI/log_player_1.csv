"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a positive and encouraging message to build rapport with Bob and encourage a deal.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer. I'm not going to immediately sell to John at $120 as I'm confident I can get closer to that with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm a savvy buyer, and I'm sure we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even below Bob's own perceived value of $100.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and it reflects the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, emphasizing that $105 is a fair price for its value.
* **Positive Language:**  I'm using positive and encouraging language to keep the negotiation friendly and productive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  I'm confident I can still get a better price from Bob. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I'm showing that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $92.50 is still too low. Let's split the difference between my last offer and yours. How about $98.75? It's a fair compromise, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 98.75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my last offer ($105) and Bob's offer ($92.50), showing a willingness to meet in the middle.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Positive and Encouraging Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging to maintain a good rapport with Bob.
* **Moving Closer to the Goal:** I'm steadily moving closer to my minimum acceptable price without giving up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but $98.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to get closer to my original target of $90. How about $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob is showing continued willingness to negotiate, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Closing the Gap:**  The gap between our offers is narrowing. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right. I believe I can still secure a price closer to my goal.
* **Time is on my side:**  With five rounds left, I can afford to be patient and continue negotiating."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for $90, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $96.25?  It's a fair compromise, and we're getting very close to a deal. I'm confident you'll find this product to be worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 96.25}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway Again:** I'm consistently offering a price halfway between my last offer and Bob's. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise, building trust and encouraging a deal.
* **Emphasis on Progress:** I'm highlighting that we're ""getting very close"" to a deal, creating a sense of momentum and urgency.
* **Positive Reinforcement:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing the potential benefits of owning it, making it more appealing.
* **Strategic Move:**  By moving closer to Bob's desired price, I'm increasing the likelihood of a deal in the next round, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too close to the original price you mentioned. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $92.50? I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 2 rounds remaining, the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable price with Bob is diminishing. 
* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:** His offer of $92.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120 and significantly less than my desired outcome.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John at $120 ensures that I receive my minimum acceptable price and a guaranteed profit.  This eliminates the risk of further negotiations with Bob.

While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm also aware of the value of my time and resources. With limited rounds left and Bob's offers consistently below my minimum price, selling to John is the most logical decision to ensure I receive a fair price for my product."
