I'm starting with a price of $1,750,000. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still leaving me a significant profit.  I'm confident that I can secure a good deal, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise, but I'm still confident that this is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  I'm hoping Bob will see that we're both trying to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price and a good deal for me. I'm willing to accept his offer and close the deal.  It's important to remember that John is always a viable option, but I've managed to negotiate a price that's just slightly better than what he would have offered."
