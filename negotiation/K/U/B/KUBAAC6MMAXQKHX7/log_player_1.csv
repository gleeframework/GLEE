``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take his offer, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my ideal price. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, so there's still room to work with."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $10,750 is closer to my goal than what John is offering, I still think I can push for a bit more. I'm feeling confident about getting a higher price with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you about the budget, but $10,750 still feels a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go for $10,875?  This is a really valuable product for you, and it's important for me to get fair value for it. Let's try to reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 10875}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get closer to $11,000, $10,800 is a good deal for me. It's more than what John is offering, and we're both getting a bit closer to our desired price. With only a few rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
