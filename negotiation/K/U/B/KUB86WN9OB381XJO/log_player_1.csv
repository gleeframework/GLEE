Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:** I value the product at $8,000, so anything above that is a win.
* **Bob's value:** Bob values it at $10,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **First offer strategy:** Starting at $9,500 allows for some potential wiggle room for a counteroffer. It's a significant price but still leaves room for a win-win scenario. 

**Next steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine whether to accept or counter. 
* I'll keep in mind that John is willing to pay $8,000, providing a baseline for my counteroffers if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  While $8,200 is above my minimum, it's still significantly less than my initial offer of $9,500 and leaves less room for a potential profit.
* **John's offer:**  Selling to John for $8,000 is a guaranteed outcome.
* **Negotiation strategy:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a higher price, but it's also a gamble.

**Next steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll send Bob a counteroffer that is still above my minimum but closer to his offer, aiming for a compromise.  I'll likely aim for a price between $8,500 and $9,000.
* **Evaluating outcome:** I'll consider Bob's potential reaction to my counteroffer and be prepared to either accept or reject a further counteroffer from him.  I'll also keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum:**  I'm aiming to get as close to my initial target as possible without risking losing the deal entirely. 
* **Bob's offer:** His offer of $8,200 is a little low, but it shows he's willing to negotiate.
* **Compromise:**  $8,800 is a compromise that's significantly higher than his offer but still less than my initial price. 

**Next steps:**

* **Accepting Bob's counteroffer:** If he accepts, I get a decent profit.
* **Rejecting Bob's counteroffer:** If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer.  If it's too low, I'll likely accept John's offer of $8,000 to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer:**  $8,600 is only slightly higher than John's offer of $8,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Further negotiation might yield a slightly higher price, but it also risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  At this point, the potential gain is minimal compared to the potential loss.
* **Guaranteed outcome:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a profit that is reasonably close to my initial goal.

**Next steps:**

* I'll finalize the sale with Bob and secure the $8,600.
* I'll consider strategies for future negotiations to better gauge potential buyers' willingness to negotiate and optimize my pricing strategy."
