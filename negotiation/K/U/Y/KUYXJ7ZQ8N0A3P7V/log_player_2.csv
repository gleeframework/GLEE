You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's always worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a better price from Alice. Even a small reduction from $999,500 would save you money."

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer might get you an even better price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000

At this point, Alice's offer is only $15,000 more than your previous counteroffer. It's likely you won't be able to get a significantly better price, and buying from John would cost you $15,000 more.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible choice."
