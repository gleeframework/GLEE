"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 180}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $180 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is worth more to me than that. How about we meet in the middle at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $130. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly anchored at $130 and is unlikely to budge significantly. It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John than to potentially waste more time and risk getting even less from Bob."
