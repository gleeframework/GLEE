"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Alice's offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget, and he can get the same product from John for a lower price."
