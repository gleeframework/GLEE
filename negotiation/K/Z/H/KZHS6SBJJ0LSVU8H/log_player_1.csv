Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to anyone else. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:** The message starts by emphasizing exclusivity, piquing Bob's interest. 
* **Value Justification:**  Instead of focusing solely on features, the message highlights the ""value"" the product offers, subtly reinforcing its worth.
* **High but Reasonable Price:**  Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to both parties, starting with a higher offer of $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming to maximize profit.
* **Open for Dialogue:** By ending with ""What do you think?"", the message encourages a response from Bob and opens the door for counter-offers.

**Important Note:**  Even though John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob might lead to a more profitable outcome."
