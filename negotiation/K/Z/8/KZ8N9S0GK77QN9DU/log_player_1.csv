Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:** Alice has a backup offer for $1,200,000 from John. 
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 gives Bob a strong incentive to buy (saving $50,000 compared to his valuation) while still netting Alice a significant profit. 

**Why this strategy is strong:**

* **High chance of acceptance:** The offer is significantly below Bob's perceived value, making it very attractive.
* **Safe fallback:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose money; she has John's guaranteed purchase."
