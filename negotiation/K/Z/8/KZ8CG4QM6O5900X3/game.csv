"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit too high for me. How about we start at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than that to me. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I need to stick to my budget. Would you consider $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $1,200,000 is still under what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept that price *if* you can guarantee a quick and smooth transaction. No delays, no complications.  Does that work for you?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
