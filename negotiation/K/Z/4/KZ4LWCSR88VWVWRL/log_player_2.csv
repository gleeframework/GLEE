Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $100. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll really enjoy it.

Alice is now matching John's price, so there's no benefit to further negotiation or buying from John.  It's time to accept the deal."
