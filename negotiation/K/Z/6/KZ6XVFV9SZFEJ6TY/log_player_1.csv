Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $130. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above Minimum:** $130 is comfortably above your $100 minimum and ensures a good profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 provides a safety net, allowing you to aim higher with Bob."
