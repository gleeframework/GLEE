"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm looking to sell the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,500,000 to you. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation.  Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll reject the offer and try to get a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to my target price, but I'm still determined to try and save more.  I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating.  There's still room for a lower price, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,050,000? This feels like a fair compromise, considering the value you're getting from the sale."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is very close to my target price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll be forced to pay more.  It's also getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the product to John.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product while still saving a significant amount of money."
