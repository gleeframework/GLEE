"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows me to make a good profit. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is above her value:** Alice wants $12,000 for something worth $8,000 to her. There's room for negotiation.
* **You have an alternative:** John offers the product at your maximum price, so you won't be left without the product. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you might prompt her to offer a lower price, closer to her own perceived value."
