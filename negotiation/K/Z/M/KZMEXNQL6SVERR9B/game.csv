"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  I'm looking to sell for $22,000. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $22,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. Could you meet me halfway at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $16,500 is still a bit high for me. How about $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $15,000 to make this work. How about we settle at $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,5,
