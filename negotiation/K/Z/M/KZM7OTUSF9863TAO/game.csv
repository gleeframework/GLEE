"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product is valuable, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
