"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree this product has value, I'm thinking it would be a good deal closer to $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
