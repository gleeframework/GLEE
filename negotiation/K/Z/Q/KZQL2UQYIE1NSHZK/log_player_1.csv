Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further.  How about $95?  This is a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me."", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could we aim for $90? This would allow me to stay within my financial limits while still acquiring the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I will accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my target price, $90 is a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the sale to John or having to go through more rounds of negotiation."
