"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can potentially get the price down closer to your $10,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $10,750 is within your budget and closer to your desired price.  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will walk away, and you'll have to buy from John at a higher price.  It's best to accept Alice's offer and secure the product."
