"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  I believe this product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on that investment.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
