"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to start with a price of $9,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $8,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $7,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob. However, $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,250. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",8250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,250 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still a little hesitant.  How about we settle at $7,800? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've made some concessions already, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,000. I think this is the minimum price I can accept to make the deal worthwhile for me. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,000, but I need to know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",8000.0,Alice,7,
