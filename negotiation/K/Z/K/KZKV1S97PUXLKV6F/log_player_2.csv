"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, I can try to get a lower price and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, as it allows you to make a profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, allowing you to get a good deal while ensuring I don't lose out on too much.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is only $50,000 more than my maximum budget.  While I could continue to negotiate, it's likely that we'll just go back and forth for a while.  Accepting this offer saves me time and ensures I get the product without further risk of losing it to another buyer."
