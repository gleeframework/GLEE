"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $16,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows me some room to negotiate. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from the price you're asking. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
