{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I appreciate his interest, $12,000 is significantly below my minimum. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $16,000?  This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows me some room to negotiate. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from the price you're asking. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm really interested in the product and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $14,000 is a decent compromise.  It's above my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely."
