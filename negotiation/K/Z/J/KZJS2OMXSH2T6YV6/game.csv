"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, recognizing its potential value. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while staying within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
