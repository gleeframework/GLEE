"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's crucial to start negotiations by rejecting this offer and setting the stage for a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product, recognizing its potential value. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price ($700,000 vs. $1,000,000) shows a willingness to negotiate and establish a starting point.
* **Acknowledging Value:** Mentioning the product's potential value demonstrates that you are not simply trying to lowball her.
* **Opening for Compromise:**  Phrasing it as finding a ""compromise"" sets a collaborative tone and encourages further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $700,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above your desired price point.  While she has moved closer to your budget, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows you to make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on your price. However, $925,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Proposing $850,000 is a strong move, as it's the midpoint between Alice's previous offer ($925,000) and your last offer ($700,000). This shows a commitment to finding a compromise and puts the pressure on Alice to make a decision.
* **Focus on Fairness:** Emphasize ""fair price"" and ""recognizing the product's value"" to keep the negotiation positive and reinforce that you're not simply trying to get a bargain. 
* **Budget Awareness:**  The line ""staying within my budget"" subtly reminds Alice of your price constraints and reinforces the need for a deal."
