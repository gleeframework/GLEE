"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in this product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1050000.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you a price of $1250000, which is a significant discount from the original price. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1250000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $1150000.  This would be a fair price for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal too. I can offer it to you for $1300000, which is still a discount from the original price. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad you're open to negotiation.  $1300000 is still a bit too high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is a significant compromise for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price that would allow us both to make a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're willing to make a big concession, Bob. I appreciate that. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I need to get closer to the value you place on this product. I'm thinking we can find a sweet spot in between $1200000 and $1300000. How about $1275000?",1275000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1275000 is close, but I'm still just a bit over my limit.  How about we meet in the middle at $1250000?  This would be a fair compromise, and we could finalize the deal.",1250000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession to get the deal done. I can offer it to you for $1300000, but I'm not going any higher than that. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,9,
