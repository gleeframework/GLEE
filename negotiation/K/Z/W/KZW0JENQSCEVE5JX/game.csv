"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,800,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I have another option for acquiring a similar product.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,400,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $1,600,000, which is a 14.3% discount from the original price. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value of the product.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,550,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and the fact that I have another option for acquiring a similar product for $1,500,000.",1550000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the value I was hoping to get from John, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you a price of $1,580,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1580000.0,Alice,5,
