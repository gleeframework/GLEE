"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is too low. I need to recoup at least a portion of the value I place on the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This would give us both a good outcome.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $1000000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's your minimum and within my budget.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm happy to close the deal."
