"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1200000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1050000? This would give us both a good outcome.  Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1050000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $1000000. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's your minimum and within my budget.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
