"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above your ideal price range. You want to try to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $700,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us."", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value and your potential benefits, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $675,000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $675,000 is a good compromise.  While it's still higher than your initial counteroffer, it's a significant drop from the initial price and brings you closer to your target.  It's also likely that further negotiation will only result in small price changes.  Accepting the offer now allows you to secure the product at a reasonable price and move forward."
