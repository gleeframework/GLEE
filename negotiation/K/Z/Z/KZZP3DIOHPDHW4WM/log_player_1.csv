Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,450,000, considering my budget is $1,500,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,350,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close, but Bob clearly has more room to negotiate.  We're still significantly above our fallback offer from John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I value your interest and want to make this work. How about we settle at $1,375,000?  It's a strong offer that reflects the value you'll gain."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than $1,375,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could push for a bit more, $1,325,000 is a solid offer. It exceeds our minimum acceptable price and gives us a significant profit. Bob has shown a willingness to move, but it's unlikely he'll go much higher. Accepting now avoids the risk of the negotiation breaking down and ensures we get a good deal."
