Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $17,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:**  You know Bob values the product at $12,000. This gives you a starting point for negotiation.
* **Aiming High, But Reasonable:** Starting with an offer of $17,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John, so you can afford to be a bit bolder in your initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's absolute maximum willingness to pay. If you knew that, you could potentially push the price even higher."
