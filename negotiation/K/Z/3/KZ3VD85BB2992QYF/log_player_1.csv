Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $110 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $110 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $130? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 130}
