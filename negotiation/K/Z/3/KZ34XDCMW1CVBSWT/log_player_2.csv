"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a special price, knowing it's worth even more to you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's maximum:** $15,000
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000
* **John's price:** $15,000

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum value.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate further with Alice or move to John as a backup."
