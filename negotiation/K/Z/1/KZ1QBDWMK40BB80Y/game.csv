"Alice, your starting price is quite high.  Given my budget and the value I place on the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential benefits. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a considerable adjustment and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement. What do you say?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $2,000,000 is still quite a bit above what I can reasonably afford.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This is a substantial increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product.  I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, $1,200,000 is a significant jump, and I appreciate that. While I'm still seeking a higher price that reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to make another adjustment.  How about we consider $1,750,000? This feels like a reasonable middle ground.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,750,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
