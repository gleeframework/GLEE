# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,300,000 is significantly higher than your budget of $800,000. It's essential to negotiate and try to bring the price down.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more agreeable price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is significantly higher than your offer reflects.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $2,000,000 is still much higher than your budget. While she has come down from her initial price, it's still not within your acceptable range. You should continue to negotiate by sending a counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're right, $1,200,000 is a significant jump, and I appreciate that. While I'm still seeking a higher price that reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to make another adjustment.  How about we consider $1,750,000? This feels like a reasonable middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000.

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $1,750,000 is still outside of your budget. You're willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product, and a price close to that is your goal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and hopefully reach a price you can accept."
