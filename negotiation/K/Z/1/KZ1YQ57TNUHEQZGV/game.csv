"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $800,000 to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering me. However, $1,200,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000.  This price reflects the value to me, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still stuck at $900,000.  It's a fair price given the value to me.  Let's try to find common ground.  I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal.",900000.0,Bob,6,
