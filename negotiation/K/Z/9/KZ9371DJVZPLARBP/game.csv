"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000,  which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $950,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your budget constraints.  $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,025,000?  This price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's make this deal happen.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,025,000 is still not within my budget. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
