While holding out for more is tempting, accepting Bob's offer of $1,620,000 makes the most sense at this stage:

* **Significant Profit:** You are still securing a $420,000 profit over your minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating a strong interest in the product.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, pushing you back to John's $1,200,000 offer."
