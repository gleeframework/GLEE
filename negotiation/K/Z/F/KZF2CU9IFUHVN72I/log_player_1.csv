Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a strategic move:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you get more than your minimum value of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:**  Bob still gets a good deal at $11,500, saving him $500 compared to his maximum value. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counter-offers, you have some wiggle room to reach a final price that benefits both of you.

This approach increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer while still securing a good profit for you."
