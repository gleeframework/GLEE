Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price given its value to me and the fact that I could secure a similar product elsewhere for $800,000.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a fair compromise, as it's right in the middle of our previous offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.
