"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a price closer to my desired value.  I'll see if Bob is willing to bite at this price, and adjust accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I need to push for a higher price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000, still higher than my minimum value, to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. This counteroffer is a compromise, acknowledging that my initial price was likely too high. I'm aiming for a quick and favorable agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $12,000.  While I'm starting to get a sense of where he might be willing to settle, I'm going to keep pushing for a better price.  I'll reject his offer and counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, to $11,000. This is still above my minimum value, but getting closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping to reach a compromise that works for both of us. If he rejects this offer, I may need to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm not willing to accept anything less than that.  However, I'm starting to feel like it's getting close to the end of our negotiation and I may not get a better offer from Bob.  If he rejects my counteroffer in the next round, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to make one last counteroffer to Bob. $11,500 is still above my minimum value, but it's getting closer to what I think Bob is willing to pay.  If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds left, Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, and I don't think he's going to budge much more. I'm running out of time and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing. It's time to take the sure thing and sell to John."
