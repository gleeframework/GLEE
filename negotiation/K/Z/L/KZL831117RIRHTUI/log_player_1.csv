Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** There's room for negotiation, giving Bob an incentive to accept.
* **It leaves space for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects, you can adjust your price based on his counteroffer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below what you're aiming for. There's room to negotiate further with Bob. You'll counteroffer to see if you can reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows willingness to negotiate:** It demonstrates you're open to finding a compromise.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:**  It gives Bob a chance to counter again without feeling pressured.
* **Is closer to your target price:**  You're aiming for a higher price while still being flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $9,800 is still below your ideal price, it's closer to your target and significantly better than selling to John for $8,000. This is a good deal considering Bob's willingness to negotiate and the possibility of further negotiation stalling. It's a reasonable compromise."
