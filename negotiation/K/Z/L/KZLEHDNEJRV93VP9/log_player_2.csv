"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
We can definitely get a better price than $12,000. Let's try a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, given the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, which is good. However, we're still closer to her initial offer than ours. Let's push a little further and see if she'll budge more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to budge a little too. How about $9,800? That's a fair offer considering its true value."",
""product_price"": 9800
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice we are willing to negotiate but also holds our ground. Moving to $9,800 keeps us closer to our desired price point."
