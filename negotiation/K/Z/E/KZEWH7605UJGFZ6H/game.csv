"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a price of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your valuation.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the price of $950,000 is too low for me to consider.  This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value you see in the product, I am unable to meet at $1,025,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000. I hope this offers a compromise that is acceptable for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
