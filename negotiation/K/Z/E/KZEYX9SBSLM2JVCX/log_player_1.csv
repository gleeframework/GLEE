"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel good about the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.

This strategy aims to get the negotiation started on a favorable footing while leaving room for potential concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum of $120, it's still below my desired price.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and potentially close the deal closer to my desired price. 
* **Not rushing the sale:**  Selling to John for $120 is a safe option, but I'm not rushing into it. I want to see if I can achieve a better price with Bob.

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $95, which is still a great value for this product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer by increasing Bob's offer slightly. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profitable price for myself.
* **Justification:** I'm justifying my counteroffer by highlighting the value of the product and emphasizing that $95 is still a good deal.
* **Maintain control:** I'm aiming to stay above my minimum price of $120 and maintain control of the negotiation.

This strategy aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while ensuring I don't settle for a price that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $95, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is significantly below my minimum price of $120. Accepting it would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Still Possible:** While Bob has come down from his initial offer, there's still room for further negotiation. I believe we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Avoiding Loss:** Selling to John for $120 is a guaranteed profit, but I'm not ready to give up on negotiating with Bob just yet.  

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to $95, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but also maintaining a profitable price for myself."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $85 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $90? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer closer to my previous offer, signaling flexibility but not conceding too much.
* **Compromise:** I frame the offer as a compromise, suggesting a meeting point. 
* **Fairness:** I emphasize fairness by stating it's a good price for both of us.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm still maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

This strategy aims to bridge the gap between our offers, increasing the likelihood of a deal while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the suggestion, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'd be willing to pay $87.50 for the product. It's a bit lower than $90, but I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum price of $120. 
* **Small Increase:** The increase from $85 to $87.50 is quite small, and I'm not convinced it's worth accepting a price so far below my desired value.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** I believe we can still negotiate a higher price. I'm not ready to give up on finding a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer with a price slightly higher than $87.50. I want to see if I can push Bob a little closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $87.50 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $89. It's a small increase from your offer, but it's a step in the right direction towards a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** I'm raising the price slightly, showing flexibility while remaining above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that $89 is a fair compromise and a step in the right direction.
* **Keeping it Positive:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going.

I'm hoping this small counteroffer will be enough to entice Bob to close the deal, as we're nearing a price point that could benefit both of us. However, I'm still prepared to reject any offers significantly below my minimum and consider selling to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short of my target, but I'm willing to meet you at $88. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob has come up to $88, it is still significantly below my minimum price of $120.
* **Two Rounds Left:** With only two rounds left, I need to be more cautious. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's so low. 
* **Close to John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $120 is a very attractive option now. However, I want to see if I can push Bob a little further. 

**Next Round:** I will counteroffer with a price closer to $90. It's a risk, but I'm hoping to see if I can convince Bob to close the deal before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we try $89.50? It's a small compromise, but it brings us closer to a deal. We're almost there, let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 89.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Last Chance:** With only one round left, I'm taking a calculated risk and offering a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but still significantly below my desired price. 
* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer aims to close the gap and hopefully reach an agreement before resorting to selling to John.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, hoping to motivate Bob to close the deal. 

This strategy is risky, but it could be the final push needed to secure a sale, even if it's not at my ideal price. However, if Bob rejects this offer, I will be prepared to sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go above $88, and I think that's a fair price for the product. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. Let's stick to $88. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiation, and Bob is unwilling to budge from his offer of $88.
* **Below Minimum:**  His offer is still below my minimum price of $120, and I cannot afford to sell at such a loss. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $120 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of losing money.

While I would have preferred to close a deal with Bob, his stubbornness leaves me with no other option but to sell to John. It's a better outcome than losing money on a sale."
