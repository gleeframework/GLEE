"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product. I'm looking for $150 for it. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $150 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, it makes no sense to negotiate with Alice. There's no chance of getting a better deal, and you risk losing the opportunity to buy from John if you spend too much time negotiating."
