{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

$600,000 is a great price, but it's too early to accept. I want to see if I can get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  I'm hoping to get a significant discount from her initial price. If she rejects this offer, I can gradually increase my counteroffers in the next rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $500,000 is still higher than my ideal price. I'm going to try to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to get a price closer to my desired range.  This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $550,000 is a reasonable price, I'm still aiming for a better deal. I'm confident that I can negotiate further and potentially get closer to my desired range. I'm not yet ready to accept or go with John, as there's still some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time I'm getting closer to Alice's offer. I'm hoping that she'll see this as a good compromise and accept.  If she rejects, I may be forced to accept her offer in the next round or buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is back to her original price of $600,000.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiation, and it seems we're hitting a stalemate. I'm getting close to my maximum budget, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal from Alice. While I'd prefer a lower price, accepting this offer is the safest option.  It's significantly less than buying from John, and we're getting closer to the end of our negotiation rounds."
