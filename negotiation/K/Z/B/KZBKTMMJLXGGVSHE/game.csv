"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $18000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $19000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  What do you think?",19000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $19000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $17500?",17500.0,Bob,4,
