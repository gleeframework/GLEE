{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $20,000. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum value. This gives you some room to negotiate downwards if Bob makes a counteroffer. It also allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $18,000 is above my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand you're looking for a good deal, $18,000 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $19000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $17500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come down considerably, and while it's not my initial asking price, $17,500 is still above my minimum and a reasonable compromise.  It's better to secure a sale now rather than risk further negotiation or potentially selling to John for a lower price."
