"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000. It's still a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen.",15500.0,Bob,4,
