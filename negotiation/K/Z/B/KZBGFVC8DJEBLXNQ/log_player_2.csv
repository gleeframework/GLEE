Alice's offer is way too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start with a strong counteroffer to show you're serious about a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise - it's higher than your previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's last offer. It shows you are serious about buying the product but also want a good deal."
