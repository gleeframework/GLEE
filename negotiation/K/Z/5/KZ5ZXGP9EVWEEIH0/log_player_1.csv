Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 10000} 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price:**  You're not selling yourself short, and still have room to move up if necessary.
* **It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate:**  By not going for your full $12,000 right away, you show that you're open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $8,000 is below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **There's room to negotiate:**  You can still try to get a better price from Bob. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:** You have a guaranteed $12,000 from John, so you're not under pressure to accept Bob's low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Still above Bob's value:**  $9,000 is still more than Bob is willing to pay, but it shows you're willing to meet him halfway.
* **Close to your minimum:**  It's closer to your $12,000 minimum, giving you more potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below your minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial one, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Risk of going lower:**  If you keep rejecting and counter-offering, there's a risk that Bob will walk away entirely, leaving you with only John's offer of $12,000. 
* **Selling to John is still a good option:** John's offer is guaranteed and meets your minimum requirement.

By rejecting Bob's offer, you're signaling that you're not willing to drop below a certain price point. This might encourage Bob to offer closer to your minimum, but you also have the option of securing the $12,000 from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This is a final attempt to get a price closer to your desired minimum. 
* **Not too far from Bob's offer:**  It's only $1,000 above Bob's current offer, indicating you're serious about reaching a deal.
* **Balancing risk:**  While there's a chance Bob will reject this offer, the risk of losing him entirely is getting higher. Selling to John for $12,000 is still an option, but you're hoping to get a bit more profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:**  $9,000 is just $3,000 below your desired minimum of $12,000. 
* **Potential of losing Bob:** If you keep rejecting, there's a good chance Bob will walk away, leaving you with only John's offer. 
* **Time to compromise:**  Given the back-and-forth, it's time to accept a price that's close enough to your minimum and ensures a sale. 

While you could try to push for more, the risk of losing Bob and settling for John's $12,000 is too high at this point. Accepting $9,000 secures a sale and minimizes potential loss."
