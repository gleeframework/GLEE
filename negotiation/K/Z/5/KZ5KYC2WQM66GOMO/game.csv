"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  Considering its value to you, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget limitations, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me.  Considering your initial valuation, I'm willing to drop to $10,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement.",10000.0,Alice,5,
