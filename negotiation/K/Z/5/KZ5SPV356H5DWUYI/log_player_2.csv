"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $165. It's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to give you a slight discount. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $165 is higher than your maximum budget of $150 and more expensive than buying from John. You can do better by rejecting this offer."
