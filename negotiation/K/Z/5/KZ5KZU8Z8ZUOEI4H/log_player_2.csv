Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it will bring to your business.

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached his limit. He's not willing to go higher than $1,000,000, and Alice is holding firm at $1,015,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. He's guaranteed the product at his maximum budget and saves the time and effort of further negotiation."
