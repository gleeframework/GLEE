"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it.

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value it will bring to your business.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,025,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that it's within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,015,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to your business, and it's still a good compromise.",1015000.0,Alice,5,
