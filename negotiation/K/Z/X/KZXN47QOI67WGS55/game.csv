"Hello Bob, I am delighted to offer you a fantastic product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential return on investment, I propose a starting price of $1,100,000. I am open to discussing this further and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  This would allow us both to make a profitable deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $950,000 undervalues the product's capabilities and potential for your business. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value and allows us both to benefit significantly.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $975,000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows us both to close this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise.  However, the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, so I'm willing to consider a price of $1,025,000. This demonstrates my commitment to closing this deal while ensuring a fair outcome for both sides.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While $1,025,000 is closer, it's still not quite within my budget.  To close this deal, I'm offering $1,000,000. This represents a significant investment on my part and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's make this happen.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
