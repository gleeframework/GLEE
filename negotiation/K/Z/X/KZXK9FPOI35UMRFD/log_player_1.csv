Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be interested in.  It's something that could be very valuable to the right person.  I'm asking for $20,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a fair price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering a price of $20,000 gives us room to negotiate downwards while still ensuring we get at least our minimum of $15,000.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  By stating we're open to a fair price, we show flexibility and willingness to work with Bob.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the potential value of the product to the right person can pique Bob's interest and encourage him to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer meets our minimum, it's worth exploring if we can get a bit more.  We're in a strong position because we have a guaranteed sale for the same price with John. By rejecting Bob's offer, we can try to push for a higher price or, at worst, accept his offer and still achieve our goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $15,000 is our minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $17,500 to finalize the deal.  This price still reflects the unique value this product offers.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** Offering $17,500 shows we're willing to negotiate but not completely cave to Bob's initial offer.
* **Reiterate Value:**  Again, we emphasize the product's value to justify our price. 
* **Direct Request for Feedback:**  Encouraging Bob to respond helps keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $17500 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $16000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Our Goal:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is very close to our minimum of $15,000.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** While we could try to push for a higher price, it's possible that Bob might be firm at $16,000.
* **Time and Effort:** Continuing to negotiate might take more time and effort, and we're already at a price that's acceptable. 

Given these factors, accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible decision, as it maximizes our profit while minimizing potential delays and complications."
