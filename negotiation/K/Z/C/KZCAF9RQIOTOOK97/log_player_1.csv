"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $2,300,000. This is a starting point for negotiation, and I'm open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's value and make subsequent offers seem more reasonable.
* **Room to Negotiate:**  The high initial price provides ample room for negotiation over the 10 rounds.
* **Gauge Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his willingness to pay and negotiating style. 

By starting high, you're in a strong position to negotiate a favorable deal while still leaving open the option to accept John's offer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have room to negotiate, and selling to John at this point would mean losing out on potential profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer.  While your initial offer is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm seeing some room for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,100,000?  This reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** You're signaling to Bob that you're willing to negotiate by significantly lowering your initial asking price. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  The counteroffer of $2,100,000 is a substantial decrease from your starting point but still keeps you well above your minimum acceptable price and closer to your initial offer than Bob's.
* **Justify the Price:** By emphasizing the ""true value,"" you're subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth and encouraging him to move closer to your price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, which indicates he's motivated to buy.  However, $1,900,000 is still below your minimum of $1,500,000.  You have room to negotiate further, and it's worth seeing if you can push the price closer to your target before accepting or considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I understand where you're coming from, and I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we settle on $2,000,000?  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the true value of what you're getting."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Movement:** You're making a smaller concession this round ($100,000) compared to the previous round ($200,000). This signals that you're getting closer to your bottom line while still encouraging Bob to move upwards. 
* **Firm but Fair:** Your message emphasizes that this is a significant move on your part,  highlighting the value you place on the product while also showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Reaching a Decision Point:** By setting the price at $2,000,000, you're putting the ball in Bob's court.  His response will be a strong indicator of how much further he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob's offer increments are getting smaller, suggesting he's reaching his maximum. His offer of $1,850,000 remains significantly below your $2,000,000 ask.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing negotiations carries the risk of Bob walking away or offering even less. Meanwhile, you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.
* **Profit Maximization:** While selling to Bob at a higher price would be ideal, the potential increase at this point is outweighed by the risk of losing both Bob and John's offers. 

Accepting John's offer guarantees your minimum acceptable profit and avoids the uncertainty of prolonged negotiations with Bob."
