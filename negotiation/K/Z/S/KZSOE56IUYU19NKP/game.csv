"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still aiming to stay under $1 million. I'm going to counter with $980,000. This would give us both a good deal, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,4,
