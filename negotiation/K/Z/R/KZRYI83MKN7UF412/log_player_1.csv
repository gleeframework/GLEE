Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start higher with Bob. This maximizes your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price, aiming to appeal to Bob's desire for a worthwhile investment. 
* **Exclusivity:**  By framing the offer as ""exclusive,"" you create a sense of urgency and desirability.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While Bob values the product at $1,200,000, he might not be willing to pay significantly more. There's a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts.
* **Negotiation:** This offer is a starting point. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go. Remember, you always have John as a backup."
