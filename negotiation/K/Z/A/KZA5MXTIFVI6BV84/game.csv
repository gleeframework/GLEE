"Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. However, I'm hoping to get a price closer to $10,000.  I understand this is a valuable product, but I'm working with a tight budget.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11,500 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a little more wiggle room.  How about $11,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can get good use out of this product. ",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $12,000. This product is still worth a significant amount to me, and I'm not ready to give up that much margin. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we compromise at $11,250? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",11250.0,Alice,5,
