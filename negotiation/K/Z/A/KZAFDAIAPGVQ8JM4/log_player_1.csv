I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a price that is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000 but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price.  I'm going to reject it and make a counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell the product for that low of a price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,500. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still leaves a good amount of profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway, and if not, I'm prepared to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, it seems his offer is not going to get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to take John's offer of $15,000. It guarantees me a higher profit and minimizes the time spent on negotiation."
