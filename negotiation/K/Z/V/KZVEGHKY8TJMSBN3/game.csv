"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I'm still constrained by my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. This is my highest possible offer, considering my financial limitations.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. However, I'm still not convinced that $1600000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1700000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a price that reflects the product's true value.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your patience, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest offer and, while I appreciate the effort, I must respectfully decline. I am unable to meet the price of $1700000. My final offer remains at $1600000. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement that respects both our positions.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
