"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to us, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's aim for a price that reflects its true value while ensuring you get a great deal. How about we start at $95?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $95 seems a bit steep. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I have a budget constraint.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. How about we meet in the middle? I'll propose $85 for the product. This still reflects its value while allowing for a reasonable transaction for you.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to meet in the middle, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $82.50? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.",82.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $80.50? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'd be happy to move forward with the purchase at that price.",80.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Considering the value and the ongoing discussion, how about we settle at $82? I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions.",82.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80.50 and $82, which would be $81.25. Would you be open to considering this price?",81.25,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your patience and understanding, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer. Considering our previous discussions, how about we finalize the deal at $81.50? I believe this price reflects the product's value while accommodating your budget constraints.",81.5,Alice,9,
