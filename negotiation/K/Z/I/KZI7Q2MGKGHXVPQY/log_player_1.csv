Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe this product would be highly beneficial to you, and this offer reflects a fair price for its value."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Secure the Sale:** While we could try for a higher price, there's always the risk Bob rejects it. Selling to John at $12,000 is our fallback to avoid losing the sale entirely.

By setting the initial offer at $14,000, Alice strikes a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
