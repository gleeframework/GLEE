"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  However, $2,200,000 is far beyond my budget for this product. I'm interested but only at a price that makes sense for both of us.  I'd be willing to consider an offer in the range of  $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you working with me on this. While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me partway, but $1,900,000 remains significantly outside what I can justify. This product is valuable, but I need the numbers to align with my budget. To be frank, anything above $1,000,000 will be a very tough sell for me.  Perhaps you see a path forward in that range?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget limitations. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for us both. Let's aim for a win-win. How about we settle on $1,350,000? This reflects a significant adjustment on my end and brings us closer to a fair deal.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to move on price is appreciated, but $1,350,000 is still too far from what I can agree to.  I need to be realistic about my budget.  To keep us moving forward, I'd be willing to go as high as $1,100,000. However, if we can't find agreement at that number, I may need to explore other options for this purchase.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and respect your need to stay within budget. I've tried to be flexible throughout our discussions. To bridge this final gap, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,225,000. This is my absolute best price, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,7,
