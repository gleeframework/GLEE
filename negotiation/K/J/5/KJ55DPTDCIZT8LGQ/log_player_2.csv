"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the value of this product is much higher.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to go up to $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $8000 is simply too low for me. Let's try to bridge the gap. How about $10000? This is a fair price considering the product's value and your own benefit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his maximum.  Bob has already shown his willingness to negotiate and has 7 rounds left. Rejecting and counter-offering again gives him more leverage to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $10,000. I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $9,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within budget while giving you a better price than John."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9000 still isn't quite enough for me. How about $11000?  I'm confident this price works for both of us, and we can close this deal. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still well above his budget with Alice's offer of $11,000.  He has 5 rounds left to negotiate, and with John's offer at $8,000, he has a safety net.  It's worthwhile to continue negotiating and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still only able to go up to $9,500. This would be a compromise that would benefit us both.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9500 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10250? This seems like a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has already negotiated for several rounds and has only three rounds left. While Alice's offer of $10,250 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than he's willing to pay.  He has a guaranteed option with John at $8,000, and continuing to negotiate with Alice risks running out of time and having to accept a price higher than his maximum.  It's more prudent to secure the product from John at his maximum budget."
