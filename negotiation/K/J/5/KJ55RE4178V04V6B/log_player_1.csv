"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I believe this is a fair price given the value it offers.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to my minimum of $15,000, I'm still within the early rounds and have room for negotiation. I'm hoping to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which reflects a compromise on both our ends.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $13,500. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $13,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $13,250, which is still above my minimum of $15,000.  Although I could continue to negotiate, I'm concerned that I might not get a better offer in the remaining rounds.  It's better to secure this price than risk losing a sale and ending up with nothing."
