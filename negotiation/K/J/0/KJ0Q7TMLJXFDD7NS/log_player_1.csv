"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good price but acknowledging that Bob has a lower valuation.  I'm leaving room for negotiation and want to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far from my minimum value.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate. $10,000 is still a good price for me, but I want to see if Bob will meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to my ideal price, Bob has moved up to $9,500.  This is a good deal for both of us.  Accepting his offer now secures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation or potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
