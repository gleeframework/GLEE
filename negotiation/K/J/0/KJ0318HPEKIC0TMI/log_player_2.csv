"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire the product for a price that's beneficial to your business.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both of you to compromise.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still too low for me. I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This price still allows for a significant profit for you, while also enabling me to achieve my desired outcome. Let's see if we can find common ground at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is closer to your desired price and still allows you to save $50,000 compared to buying from John.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't get you a significantly better price.  Accepting the offer is the best course of action to secure the product at a reasonable price."
