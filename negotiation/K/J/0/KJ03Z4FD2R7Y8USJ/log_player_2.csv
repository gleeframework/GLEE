It's not worth buying the product from Alice for $180 when you can get it from John for $150.  We'll try to negotiate with Alice to get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}

I'm offering Alice $140 for the product. This is a fair price considering I can get it for $150 from John, and Alice is willing to sell it for $150. Let's see if she accepts."

While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

I'm offering Alice $150, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. This is her target price, so it's a fair offer. Hopefully, she accepts."
