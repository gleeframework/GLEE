Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, potentially even more than my valuation. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This represents a unique opportunity for you to acquire it before I explore other options."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) without pushing him away.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a high offer of $1,400,000 sets a strong anchor point. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints that the product might be worth even more to Bob, justifying the high price.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  The message mentions ""other options,"" subtly reminding Bob that he's not the only potential buyer. This adds a sense of urgency without being too aggressive.

**Outcome:**

* **Best Case:** Bob accepts the $1,400,000 offer, netting you a significant profit.
* **Alternative:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, ensuring you meet your minimum acceptable price."
