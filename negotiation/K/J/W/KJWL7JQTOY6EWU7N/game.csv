"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, $1,000,000 is the very top end of my budget. If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is the top end of your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
