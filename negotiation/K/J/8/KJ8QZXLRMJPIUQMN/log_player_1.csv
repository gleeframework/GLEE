Round 2

# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider reducing the price to $950,000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I can likely do better. I want to see if I can push him further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, but that's my final offer.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for your product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $1,000,000 matches what John is offering. Since I have 10 rounds to close the deal, and I'm already at my minimum price, it's best to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
