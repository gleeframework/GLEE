"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that could be incredibly valuable to your business. I understand this is a significant investment, so I'm willing to discuss the price.  My minimum asking price is $1750000, but I'm open to negotiation. If we can't reach an agreement, I have another buyer lined up.  What are your thoughts?",1750000.0,Alice,1,
