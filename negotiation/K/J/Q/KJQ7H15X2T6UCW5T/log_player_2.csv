"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $100 by both parties. Considering its quality and benefits, I would like to propose an initial price of $95. I hope this aligns with your expectations and we can move forward towards a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer is good, there's room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $100 to you and you have 10 rounds, it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of that, I am willing to consider $90 as the price for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise while still ensuring a reasonable profit for us. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $90, which is closer to my target price of $85.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that she'll reject my next counteroffer and we'll run out of rounds. Accepting the offer at $90 is a good compromise and saves me $10 compared to buying from John."
