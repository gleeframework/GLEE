"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You can get a better deal from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and see if she'll come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm not able to go that low. How about $10,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

You can get the product for $10,000 from John, which is a better deal than Alice's latest offer of $10,500. There's no need to keep negotiating with Alice at this point."
