"I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7000. However, I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $9500 and $7000. How about we try $8250? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $7500? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a decision quickly if we can agree on this price.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7500. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet you halfway between $8250 and $7500? That would put the price at $7875. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",7875.0,Alice,5,
