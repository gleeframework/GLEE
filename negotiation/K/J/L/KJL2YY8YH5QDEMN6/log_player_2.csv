"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $11,500. It's in excellent condition and I know you've been looking for one.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $12,000, and your absolute limit is $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or see if she counters with an even better offer."
