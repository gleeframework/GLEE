Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before going to John (who guarantees $120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is just below your minimum, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested, potentially earning you even more. 
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Adding a ""limited time"" element can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly, preventing him from overthinking and potentially rejecting the offer. 

This strategy aims to balance getting the best price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
