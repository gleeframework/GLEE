"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $10,000. Is this a price you'd be comfortable with?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  What if we split the difference and settled on $8,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",8500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $9,500, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",9500.0,Alice,7,
