"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer to purchase it from me for $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, I appreciate it.  However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to come down to $10,500? ",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $11,250 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still not quite there yet.  How about $10,750?  I believe this is a fair compromise that allows both of us to get a good deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting a better price. I can offer it to you for $11,000. This is my final concession, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want the best price possible, and I do too.  Let's split the difference on our last offers. How about $10,875? This would be a win-win situation for both of us, and we can close this deal.",10875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your creative approach, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10,875. I can offer it to you for $11,100. This is a compromise, but I still believe it's a fair price for the product.",11100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I think we're very close to an agreement.  I'm willing to go up to $10,950. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'd really like to close this deal.",10950.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob. I can see that you're willing to meet me at $10,950. I'll meet you halfway between $10,950 and $11,100, which is $11,025. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great deal for both of us.",11025.0,Alice,9,
