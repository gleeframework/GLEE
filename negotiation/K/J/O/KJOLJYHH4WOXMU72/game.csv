"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's significantly lower than its true worth.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $1,200,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
