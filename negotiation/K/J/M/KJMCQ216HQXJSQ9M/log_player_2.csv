"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $650,000 is a significant amount, and there's potential to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant reduction from Alice's initial price. It's a strong starting point for negotiation, showing Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal.  We'll see if Alice is willing to come down to a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is only willing to come down $50,000 from her initial offer.  That's not a significant enough drop to justify accepting her offer. It's still too high, and we have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our counteroffer slightly to $550,000. This shows Alice we're serious about negotiating but are also willing to compromise. This is a reasonable middle ground between our previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and might encourage her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still not coming down to a price that's particularly attractive. While her offer is slightly lower than her previous one, it's still significantly higher than our desired price point.  We have more time to negotiate, and there's a chance she might come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 575000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're raising our counteroffer again, but only slightly to $575,000. This shows Alice that we're willing to meet her halfway, but are not willing to accept a price too far above our desired price point. We're getting close to a potential deal, but need to see if Alice is willing to come down just a bit more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $640,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $640,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's lower than her previous offer, it's still not in the range that I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to continue negotiating, but if she doesn't come down in price soon, I'll need to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're making a significant increase to our counteroffer to $600,000. This is a bold move, but it shows Alice that we're serious about reaching a deal. We've shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer is closer to Alice's latest offer.  We'll see if this is enough to convince her to accept. If she doesn't, we'll need to start seriously considering buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $655,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $655,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's getting very late in the negotiation, and Alice seems unwilling to drop her price significantly. Her latest offer is even higher than her initial offer. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $1,000,000.  It's a guaranteed deal, and while expensive, it's more predictable than continuing to risk getting no deal at all with Alice."
