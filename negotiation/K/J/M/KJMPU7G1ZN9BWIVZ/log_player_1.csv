Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm also leaving room for negotiation if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still get a better price from John. I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering a price slightly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than what I could get from John. This shows flexibility while still aiming for a profit closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, but it's still not worth it for me to continue negotiating. I'm going to sell the product to John for $100, which is a better deal than what Bob is offering."
