"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a very competitive price, considering its potential and my other offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget.  However, I've received a strong offer from another buyer for $1,500,000. Given the value of this product, I'm inclined to accept that offer if I can't get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to increase your offer at all to secure the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is showing strong resistance to coming down significantly in price. Her mention of another buyer at $1,500,000 (her product's true value to her) is likely a tactic to pressure me.  I've already hit my maximum budget, and further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at my desired price."
