,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $120 is significantly below what I'm able to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? That's still a great deal for a product of this quality. Let me know what you think!",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $150 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $75? I really think this product would be a great addition to my collection, and I'm willing to pay a fair price for it.",75.0,Bob,4,
