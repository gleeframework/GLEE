"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000, considering your interest. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I need to make this work. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit, but I'm still a bit away from that number. How about $1,100,000? That's a significant jump on my end.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still too far off for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I'll meet you halfway at $1,125,000. This is my final offer.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
