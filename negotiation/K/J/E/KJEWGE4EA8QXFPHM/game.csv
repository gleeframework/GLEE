"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, $20000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to our initial discussion. How about $14000 for the product?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000 for the product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to what you're willing to pay. How about $12000 for the product?",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000. If we can meet in the middle, I think we can close this deal.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good price for the product. How about $11500 for the product? This is my best offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,7,
