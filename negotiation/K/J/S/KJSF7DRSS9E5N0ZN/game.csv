"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me right now. However, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This still allows me to make a profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from the $10,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",10000.0,Bob,4,
