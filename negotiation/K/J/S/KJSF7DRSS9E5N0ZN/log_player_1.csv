Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Offering a ""Fair"" Price:** Framing the offer as fair for both parties can help build goodwill and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  $12,000 is still above my minimum, allowing me to make counteroffers if needed.
* **Knowing the Alternative:** Having John as an alternative buyer gives me leverage and confidence to stand firm on my pricing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.** While it's better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **I have a better alternative.** Selling to John for $15,000 is a guaranteed higher profit, so there's no reason to accept Bob's low offer.
* **Negotiation opportunity.** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me right now. However, I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This still allows me to make a profit, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer within a reasonable range:**  $10,500 is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin.
* **Highlighting value:**  Reiterating the value of the product helps justify the price and reinforces the idea of a fair deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still above Bob's offer, giving me room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Staying above minimum:**  $10,500 is above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit far from the $10,500. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,000. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.** While it's getting closer, it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation.
* **I have a guaranteed higher profit with John.** Selling to John for $15,000 eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation and guarantees a higher profit.
* **Time is a factor.**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks delaying the sale and potentially losing out on the opportunity to sell to John.

It's important to remember that maximizing profit is my goal, and in this case, selling to John immediately ensures the best outcome."
