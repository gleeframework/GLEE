"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for this product, based on my own research and assessment of its value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's unique features and value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1400000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000.  This is a serious offer and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1100000. I'm willing to compromise further and counteroffer at $1250000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
