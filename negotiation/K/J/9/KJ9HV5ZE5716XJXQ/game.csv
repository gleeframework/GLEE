"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $12,500?  That gives us both a good deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $12,500 is still a little bit of a stretch for me.  How about we split the difference and make it $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $11,250 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $11,750? It's a fair price for both of us.",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, $11,750 is pushing my budget. I can do $11,100, and that's really the best I can offer.  It's a fair deal and gives us both something.",11100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's make it $11,400.  I think that's a fair compromise.",11400.0,Alice,7,
