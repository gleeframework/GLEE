Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents excellent value, even at this price."",
""product_price"": 14999 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, aiming slightly lower with Bob might secure a quicker sale and still yield a significant profit.
* **Sense of Urgency and Value:** The message hints at the product's value while subtly creating a sense of urgency by positioning it as a limited-time opportunity. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Setting the initial price slightly below John's offer leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested while still ensuring Alice gets a price close to her minimum."
