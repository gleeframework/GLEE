Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to secure a deal with Bob before moving on to John.

**Strategy**

The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible without scaring him off. A price too close to his valuation might make him wary, while a price too low leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:** Highlighting ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of desirability.
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning its value subtly reinforces its worth.
* **Confident Price:** $1,350,000  is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.  Observe his reaction and adjust accordingly. Remember, any offer above $1,000,000 is a win for you!"
