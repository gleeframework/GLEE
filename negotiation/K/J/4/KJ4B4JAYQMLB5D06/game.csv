"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for it. How about we meet at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $1,025,000 for it. How about we meet at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
