"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's opening offer is already a good deal, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get a lower price in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,000,000 for it. How about we meet at $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to my price range, but I think I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm getting closer to a price I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle at $975,000?"",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $975,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $1,025,000 for it. How about we meet at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is consistently lowering her price, and the difference is getting smaller.  $1,025,000 is a reasonable price, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
