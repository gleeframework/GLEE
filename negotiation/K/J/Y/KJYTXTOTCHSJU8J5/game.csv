"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $13,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will deliver significant value for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $15,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can offer, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,
