# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but based on my research and budget, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1500000? I believe we might be able to reach an agreement closer to that amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
