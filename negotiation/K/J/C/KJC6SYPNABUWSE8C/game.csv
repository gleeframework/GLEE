"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but based on my research and budget, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Would you consider lowering the price to $1500000? I believe we might be able to reach an agreement closer to that amount.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I can't go as low as $1500000, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1750000? This would still allow me to achieve a reasonable profit while making the product accessible to you. Let's find a middle ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to compromise, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget and the current market conditions, I propose a price of $1600000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair balance between the value of the product and what I'm comfortable spending. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
