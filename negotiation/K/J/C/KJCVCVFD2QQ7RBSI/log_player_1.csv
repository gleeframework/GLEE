{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll love it! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering the product at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob a reason to consider the offer while still leaving room for negotiation. I am hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I can adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired value of $100. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I'm not quite ready to go that low just yet. I'm willing to come down to $95.  This is a fair price considering the value I'm offering. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $85 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum desired value of $100. While I'd rather sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go that low.  I'll accept John's offer to sell the product for $100."
