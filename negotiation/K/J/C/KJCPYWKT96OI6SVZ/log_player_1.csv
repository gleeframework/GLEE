Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. It's a fantastic deal on something I know you're interested in."",
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while staying above your minimum selling price ($12,000). 
* **Create Urgency:** Offering a high but slightly negotiable price creates a sense of urgency. Bob might be willing to pay a premium to avoid missing out, especially if he believes the product is worth $8,000 to him.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  A successful negotiation often involves understanding the buyer's motivations and adjusting your approach accordingly."
