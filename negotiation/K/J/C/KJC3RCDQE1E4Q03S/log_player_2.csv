"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $20,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $15,000. I can meet you halfway at $17,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500.

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $17,500 is still too high for Bob, and he can get the product from John for his maximum budget of $15,000."
