"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than $120, it's still above Bob's maximum value of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit above my budget.  How about $105?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $105 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $108, which is a great deal for both of us. I think you'll really appreciate the value this product brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $108 is still slightly above Bob's desired price point, but it's a good compromise.  Bob is likely to get a better deal than buying from John, and this price is closer to Alice's desired price, making it more likely she'll accept. It's a good balance between savings and potential deal closure."
