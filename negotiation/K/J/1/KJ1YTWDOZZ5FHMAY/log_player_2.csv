Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for Bob, and he can try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that 12000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of 11500. What do you think?

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate further. He should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $10,500."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm thinking of a price of 11250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I'm still confident it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's still a little higher than his ideal price, it's a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might risk Alice walking away, and then he'd be forced to buy from John for a much higher price."
