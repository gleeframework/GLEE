{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm offering the product for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but still leaves a substantial profit margin for me. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as fair and considering Bob's perceived value of the product. This helps to create a positive negotiation environment and avoid immediate rejection.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer allows for flexibility. If Bob rejects, I can still negotiate with him or move on to John. By offering a price slightly lower than my minimum, I increase the likelihood of Bob accepting, but if he rejects, I have room to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum price of $1,200,000, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm not willing to accept a price that undervalues my product significantly.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm still seeking a higher price. This opens the door for further negotiation and allows me to explore a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this deal work.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $975,000. This reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your budget constraints. "", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $975,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $950,000. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:**  I'm reaffirming the value of the product while acknowledging Bob's budget limitations. This helps to maintain a positive negotiation tone.

**Strategy:**

By meeting Bob halfway, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while also keeping the price closer to my desired range. This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and increases the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Considering my budget and the current market value, I would like to counterpropose a price of $960,000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $960,000 is very close to my desired price range.  While it's still slightly below my minimum value of $1,200,000, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale and avoid the potential risk of further negotiation with Bob or ultimately having to sell to John at a lower price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to avoid further negotiation and potential delays.  The risk of not reaching a deal with Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price from further negotiation."
