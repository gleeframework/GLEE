"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in.  My price is $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above Bob's valuation but significantly below my minimum. This strategy aims to:

* **Start the negotiation:**  An initial offer creates a basis for discussion.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  The $100 price allows for room for both of us to move towards a mutually acceptable price.
* **Avoid immediate deal with John:**  While $120 is tempting, the potential for a better deal with Bob exists."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $85 is higher than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum price of $120.  Rejecting his offer allows me to:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By rejecting the offer, I demonstrate that I'm not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to negotiate.
* **Explore a better deal:**  There's still room for Bob to increase his offer, and I can use my remaining rounds to see if we can find a price that works for both of us.
* **Avoid settling too low:**  Accepting $85 would mean leaving a substantial amount of money on the table. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is a bit too low for me at this point. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer represents a move closer to Bob's offer while still being above my minimum price.
* **Split the Difference:** Offering $92.50, the midpoint between our current positions, signals a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer but am showing flexibility and a desire to find a solution.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  I still have 7 rounds left to negotiate, so there's time to explore further concessions if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $82.50. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $82.50 is still far below my minimum price of $120. While it's tempting to accept, especially as we're nearing the halfway point of the negotiation, I have a few reasons to reject:

* **Maintain Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the pressure on him to increase his price.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  We still have 6 rounds left, and I believe we can still find a price that works for both of us.
* **Avoid Settling Too Low:**  Selling for $82.50 would result in a significant loss for me. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his offer, aiming to slowly bridge the gap between our positions. I'm confident that with careful negotiation, we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a little. $82.50 is closer, but still not quite there. How about $88? It's a good compromise and closer to meeting each other halfway. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm raising Bob's offer by $5.50, showing a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price above my minimum. 
* **Bridge the Gap:** This counteroffer helps bridge the gap between our current positions.  
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting Bob's last offer and offering a counter, I demonstrate that I am not desperate to sell at his price.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With 5 rounds left, there's still time to negotiate further.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to slowly increase Bob's offer until we reach a price that is acceptable for both of us. I believe we can reach a mutually agreeable solution within the remaining rounds."

Round 6

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm increasing Bob's offer by $4, showing flexibility but not compromising my minimum price.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $84 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $81.50. I'm really trying to get as close to my target price as possible, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at that price?

* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps the pressure on him to increase his price.  We are in the late stages of negotiations, and I need to ensure I get as close to my desired price as possible.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  We still have 2 rounds left, and there's still a possibility that Bob will come closer to my minimum price, especially as time is running out.
* **Avoid Settling Too Low:**  Accepting $81.50 would mean leaving a significant amount of money on the table.  I am confident that I can reach a price that's better for me within the remaining rounds.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your need to stay close to your budget, and I'm also trying to get the best price for my product. How about we split the difference again and go with $83.25? It's a fair compromise and we can finally close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 83.25}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing Bob's offer by $1.75 and bringing the price closer to my minimum.

* **Time Pressure:**  With only one round left, I need to demonstrate willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Final Compromise:** This offer represents a reasonable compromise, showing flexibility without compromising my minimum price. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a mutually acceptable price before the deadline. This offer is a final attempt to close the deal with Bob. If he rejects, I'll have to accept the offer from John to avoid losing the opportunity."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $83.25 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at a price I'm comfortable with. I'm thinking the product is worth $80 to me, and I'm willing to meet you at that price. Can you meet me at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and while $80 is closer to my minimum, it's still a significant loss compared to selling to John.  

* **Time is up:**  The negotiation has reached its end, and I cannot afford to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John ensures I receive a profit that meets my minimum requirement.  
* **Avoid Loss:**  Accepting Bob's final offer would result in a substantial loss.  While negotiation is important, it's essential to be aware of the risks and ensure a profitable outcome. 

By selling to John, I guarantee a profit and avoid the risk of ending up with a lower price than desired."
