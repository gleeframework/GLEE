""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. Would you consider $8,000?"",

I'm starting with a low but reasonable counteroffer. It's a good starting point for negotiation, and it lets Alice know I'm serious about buying but need a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9,200. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really love the product!

Alice is coming down, but the price is still too high. I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get a better deal."

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still a bit far from your $8,600 offer, but I'm willing to come down a bit more. I can do $8,800. It's my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

This is a good deal, and Alice seems firm on her final offer. It's better to accept this price than risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher amount."
