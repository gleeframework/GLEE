"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting but $15,000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  Let's start with $10,000.  This reflects the value I see in the product and is within my budget."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. After considering your offer, I believe we can find a middle ground. I am willing to consider $14000 for the product, reflecting its value while staying within your budget.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum value. There's still room to negotiate a lower price.  It makes sense to reject this offer and try for a lower price in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still higher than what he is willing to pay. There is still room for negotiation, and Bob is willing to continue negotiating with Alice.  It makes sense to reject this offer and try for a lower price in the next round."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still determined to get the product for as close to his maximum value as possible.  While $12,500 is getting closer to Bob's maximum value, he still has a little bit of room to negotiate.  It makes sense to reject this offer and try for a lower price in the next round."
