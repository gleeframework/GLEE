"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is $1,000 lower than your maximum price, but it's still higher than her value of $8,000. This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can try to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to offer you $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering your value and my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that our product is worth more to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,800. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,800, which is only $300 more than my counteroffer of $8,500.  This is a good deal for me, as it's still below my maximum price of $10,000 and significantly lower than Alice's initial offer.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John for a higher price."
