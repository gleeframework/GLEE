{""product_price"": 150}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a price that is higher than my minimum acceptable value of $120, giving me a profit margin. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm starting with a price that leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll still be able to sell to John at $120, ensuring I don't lose money."
