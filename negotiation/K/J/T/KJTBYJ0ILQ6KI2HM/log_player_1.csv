Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $110 for it. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** It leaves room for you to lower the price if necessary.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It's easy for Bob to understand. 

If Bob rejects, we can then assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worthwhile to continue negotiating or if we're better off selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum, it's still below what you'd ideally like to get for the product. You have a guaranteed $120 from John, so it's not worth settling for $90 right now.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. That's still a fair price for both of us, and it's the best I can do right now."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to your minimum.
* **Clear & Concise:** Itâ€™s straightforward, making it easy for Bob to understand. 
* **Justification:** You offer a reason for the price (""a fair price for both of us""), which can help Bob understand your perspective. 

By offering $100, we're leaving some room for negotiation but not sacrificing too much profit.  If Bob rejects, we can re-evaluate and decide whether to continue negotiations or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $100. How about we meet in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $95 is tempting and getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price. You have a guaranteed $120 from John, making it risky to settle for less, especially since you're already close to your desired price point. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make one final counteroffer before deciding to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference - I'll go down to $97.50. This way, we both get a fair price, and I can avoid having to sell to someone else.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  This counteroffer signifies that you are nearing your minimum and are trying to reach a compromise.
* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering a price exactly in between the last two offers, you appear flexible and reasonable.
* **Appeal to Bob's Interest:** Mentioning the potential of selling to someone else adds pressure, subtly encouraging Bob to accept the offer.

This counteroffer is the last chance to get a decent price from Bob before resorting to selling to John for the guaranteed $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $97.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $92 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired price point. With the guaranteed $120 from John, it's not worth risking a lower price with Bob.  Furthermore, the negotiation seems to have reached a stalemate, with both parties unwilling to budge significantly.  Selling to John at this point ensures a comfortable profit and avoids further negotiation."
