"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $750000 is below what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. I'm proposing a price of $850000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I believe it's still a good deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,
