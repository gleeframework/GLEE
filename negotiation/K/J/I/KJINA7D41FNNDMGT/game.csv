I have a unique and valuable product that I think you might be interested in. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a high-end item that could bring significant benefits to your business or personal life. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think?,20000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $18000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider at this point.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $16000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal. However, $16000 is still a bit lower than I'd like to sell it for. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to make a profit. I can sell the product to you for $17500. This is my final offer in this range.",17500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but $17500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16500 for the product. This is my final offer.",16500.0,Bob,6,
