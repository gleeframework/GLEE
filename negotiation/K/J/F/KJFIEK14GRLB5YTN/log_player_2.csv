"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that I believe will be a significant asset to your operations.  It's worth a great deal to me, and I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you.  My asking price is $950,000.  This represents a substantial savings compared to the value you'll realize from it.  Please consider this carefully, as I have a backup buyer who is ready to purchase at a lower price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
