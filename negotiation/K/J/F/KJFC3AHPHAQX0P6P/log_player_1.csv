I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is more than what John is offering, I think I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,500 is tempting, it's a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $8,750? That's a good middle ground, and I think it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000.  Bob is offering the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I'm running out of time and want to secure the deal.  Selling to John guarantees me a sale at my minimum price."
