Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a reasonable counteroffer:**  Offering $125 is a significant drop from Alice's initial price of $135, demonstrating your desire to negotiate.
* **Leave room for compromise:** This price is still higher than what the product is worth to Alice, allowing for potential back-and-forth. 
* **Maximize your savings:** You aim to get the lowest possible price, but still want to secure the product within your budget."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is your maximum:** This price is exactly what you are willing to pay, and there's no room for negotiation.
* **You have 3 rounds left:**  While you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee that you'll get a lower price.

By buying from John, you are guaranteed to get the product at a price you are comfortable with, without risking further rounds of negotiation.  While it's not the lowest price, it's a reasonable alternative to risking a deal with Alice."
