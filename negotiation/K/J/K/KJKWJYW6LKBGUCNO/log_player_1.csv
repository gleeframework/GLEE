Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,700,000. This is a higher price than his perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a better deal than selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $1,400,000. This is still above his initial offer, but it's a significant step down from my first offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  This price is closer to his perceived value while still allowing me to get closer to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's counteroffers have consistently been below my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which may not result in a better outcome."
