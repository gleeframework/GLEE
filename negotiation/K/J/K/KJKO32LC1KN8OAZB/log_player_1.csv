Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your value)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **John's Offer:** $1,000,000 (your safety net)

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of the value difference between what Bob thinks it's worth and your minimum price. However, you need to leave Bob feeling like he's getting a deal too.  Aiming too high could make him walk away.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Positive:** The message is clear and highlights the product's value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $50,000, incentivizing him to buy.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""return on investment,"" you subtly anchor the price to its value for Bob, not just its cost.

**Important Notes**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have some wiggle room before hitting your minimum. 
* **Relationship:**  Consider if a long-term relationship with Bob is more important than squeezing out the highest possible price in this single transaction."
