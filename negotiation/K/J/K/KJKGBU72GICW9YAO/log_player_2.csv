"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is less than Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $900,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $1,200,000, while still leaving some room for potential negotiation. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying the product but is also looking for a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant savings compared to buying from John. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting the offer and potentially increasing the price again or even backing out of the deal altogether is high. Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price and avoids further uncertainty."
