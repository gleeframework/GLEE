"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'll be very interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $100.  Let me know what you think!",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still a little too low for me. How about $95? That's a fair compromise, and I think it still leaves you with a good value.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident that I would get good value for the product at that price.",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. $92.50 is a good offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we settle at $94? That's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $93.25. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think.",93.25,Bob,6,
