"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $950,000.  This is a significant opportunity to acquire a product worth over $1 million for a substantial discount.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,000,000, it's still higher than what John is offering. You can save $50,000 by going with John. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price further. However, even if she doesn't budge, John's offer provides a better deal."
