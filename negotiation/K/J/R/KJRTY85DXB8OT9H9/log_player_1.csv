Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $105. I'm willing to meet you at $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** While I'd ideally like to get more, Bob is unlikely to go higher. Accepting $95 ensures a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away, forcing me to sell to John for $100."
