"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product, which is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire it at a competitive price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is clearly inflating the price and trying to mislead you about the product's value to you.  You know you can get the product for a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's inflated offer."
