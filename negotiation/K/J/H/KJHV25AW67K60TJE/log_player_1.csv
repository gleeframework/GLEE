Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, he's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, the difference between his offer ($975,000) and John's standing offer ($1,200,000) is too large to ignore. It makes more financial sense to cut my losses with Bob and take the guaranteed deal with John."
