,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $110 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $125. Would you be willing to consider $115?",115.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still below my minimum. Let's try $120. It's a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy.",120.0,Alice,5,
