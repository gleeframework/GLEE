"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $1,500,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,200,000. This means there's room for negotiation, and I can likely get a better price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Alice with a lower price, aiming to be close to my $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still above my target price of $800,000. I want to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if she's willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above my target price, but it's a step in the right direction. I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $950,000.  Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate, and this offer is still a substantial discount from her initial offer. I want to see if she's willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but $1,050,000 is still too high. I believe I can push for a better price, especially as we're halfway through the negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $950,000, potentially even slightly lower, to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $975,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still too far away from my target price.  While I'm getting closer, I'm starting to run out of rounds. I want to see if I can get her lower, but I'm also getting closer to my limit for negotiations. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make another counteroffer, trying to push for a price closer to $975,000,  but I need to be careful not to go too low and risk her rejecting it and potentially ending the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 990000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $990,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise. However, it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. With only a few rounds left, I'm pushing for a price that is close to my limit while trying to avoid a stalemate. I'm hoping that Alice sees that I'm serious about buying the product and will accept this final offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round, and while Alice is still coming down in price, she's not getting close enough to my target.  At this point, the risk of not closing a deal with her is too high. I'm already close to my upper limit, and further negotiations may result in a stalemate. 

By purchasing from John, I guarantee myself a deal within my budget and avoid the risk of losing the opportunity completely."
