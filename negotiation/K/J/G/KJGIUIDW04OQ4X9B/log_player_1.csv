Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and inviting, hoping to build a positive rapport with Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I explicitly state that I'm open to negotiation, indicating flexibility. 

This strategy allows me to see if Bob is interested at a high price and if not, we can explore more reasonable options.  It also keeps the door open for me to switch to John if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer more, accepting his offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether."
