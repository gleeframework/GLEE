Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment.  I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a significantly higher price than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000) sets a strong anchor. This can make your eventual target price seem more reasonable in comparison. 
* **Justification:**  Mentioning the ""value and potential"" provides a vague but positive justification for the high price, appealing to Bob's potential desire for a good investment.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""proposing a price"" and ""discuss further"" signals willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in this scenario.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  This offer assumes some things about Bob.  If you knew Bob was extremely price-sensitive or disliked haggling, a different approach might be necessary.
* **Information Asymmetry:** You have the advantage of knowing John's guaranteed offer.  However, revealing this directly could weaken your position.

This is a starting point for negotiation.  Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response and any additional information you gather during the negotiation process."
