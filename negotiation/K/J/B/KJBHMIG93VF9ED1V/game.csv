"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Bob, I understand that you're still looking to negotiate further. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go below $800,000. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  My final offer is $775,000. If you can't accept that, I'll have to consider John's offer.",775000.0,Bob,6,
