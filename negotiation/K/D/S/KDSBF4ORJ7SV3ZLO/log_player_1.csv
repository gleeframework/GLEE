Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but given my budget constraints, I can only consider offers within my price range. I am willing to pay up to $800000 for the product. Let me know if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I need to explore if we can reach a better compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is the best I can do, let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Given my current financial situation, I would like to propose a price of $1000000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between our positions. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my threshold. I need to see if I can squeeze out a bit more."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,150,000. This is my final concession, let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I am willing to pay $1050000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise and hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I've already had to make several concessions. There's a risk that further negotiation with Bob will result in a lower price. Selling to John for $1,200,000 ensures a good price and avoids further negotiation risk."
