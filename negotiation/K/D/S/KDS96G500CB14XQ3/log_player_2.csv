"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for a price of $13,000. I believe this product will be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,500 is a good deal for Bob.**  It's significantly lower than John's price of $15,000 and still allows Bob to save money compared to Alice's initial offer.
* **Further negotiation may be time-consuming and risky.** There's no guarantee Bob can get a lower price from Alice, and he risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without unnecessary delays or risks.**"
