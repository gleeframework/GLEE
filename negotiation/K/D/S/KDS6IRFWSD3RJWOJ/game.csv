"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you coming down to $1,000,000.  However, I'm still looking to save a bit more.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is still a good deal for both of us, as it's well above your minimum and significantly below my maximum. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we split the difference and agree on $950,000? This is still a great deal for you, as it's significantly below your estimated value.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
