"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $800000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $700000 for it. This is a fair price considering I'm still paying a premium for the product's value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and the premium you're willing to pay. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,3,
