"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

You have no information about Alice's minimum acceptable price.  Buying from John guarantees you the product for your maximum budget. There's no upside to negotiating with Alice as you risk getting stuck with a higher price or a lengthy negotiation that could lead to missing out on the product altogether."
