Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. That's the value you mentioned it's worth to you, and I'm willing to pay that price.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is my minimum, I can potentially get more by continuing the negotiation. I want to see if I can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $8,000 is simply too low for me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try and push for something closer to my initial counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit above my target. How about we settle on $8,300? It's a fair price for both of us and we can close the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8300}

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I've already rejected his last two offers. There's a risk that we'll go back and forth for the remaining rounds without reaching an agreement.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm going to sell to him and avoid any further risk."
