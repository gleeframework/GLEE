"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000, which is my minimum price for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,050,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be willing to consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $925,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on the deal. I can do $975,000, which is $75,000 more than your last offer. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $975,000 is getting closer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me there?",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not quite there. I can do $985,000, which is $35,000 above your last offer. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle now.",985000.0,Alice,7,
