Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This gives me a good starting point for negotiation, while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. I'm confident that Bob will likely counteroffer, and we can then work towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $14,000. This is still a decent amount above my minimum, but it shows flexibility and encourages Bob to come up with a more reasonable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, it's likely that we'll get stuck in a stalemate.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of a further price decrease from Bob."
