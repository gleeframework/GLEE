Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $2,300,000 is well above my budget. Given the product's worth to me, I can offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $2,100,000. This offer reflects the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,100,000 remains out of my price range. I'm still committed to acquiring this product, but I can only offer $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering my own valuation and your need to sell.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $1,000,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's unlikely he'll bridge that gap in the remaining rounds. Accepting John's offer guarantees you your desired profit with no further risk or negotiation."
