Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider coming down to $2,100,000. This offer reflects the product's potential and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,100,000

Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth trying a counteroffer again, to see if we can get closer to my budget."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,100,000 remains out of my price range. I'm still committed to acquiring this product, but I can only offer $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering my own valuation and your need to sell.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
