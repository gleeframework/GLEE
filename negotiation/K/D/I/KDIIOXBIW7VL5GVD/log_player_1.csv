"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that reflects the product's value to me.  Since Bob only values it at $800,000, this is likely to be rejected, but it sets the stage for negotiation.  I have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John, so I can afford to be a bit aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum desired value of $1,000,000. I have more rounds to negotiate and I can always sell to John for $1,000,000. I want to see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer but still staying above my minimum. I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if Bob is willing to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I have more rounds to negotiate and I can always sell to John for $1,000,000. I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher, but also understand time is running out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but this time I'm getting closer to my minimum desired value of $1,000,000. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a genuine effort to close the deal and might be willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I'm still in a good position to sell to John, but with fewer rounds remaining, I need to be more strategic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only four rounds left and Bob's offer still below my minimum, I'm not confident I can get him to meet my price. It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than risk getting less from Bob."
