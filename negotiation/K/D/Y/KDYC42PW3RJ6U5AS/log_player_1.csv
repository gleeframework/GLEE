Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a higher offer ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Gauge Interest:** Bob's response will give you an idea of his willingness to pay above $10,000.  

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. Your goal is to find a price that's acceptable to both of you, ideally exceeding your minimum of $10,000."
