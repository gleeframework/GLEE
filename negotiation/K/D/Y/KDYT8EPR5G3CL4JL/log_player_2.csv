"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you say?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer. While it's better than her asking price, I can try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd love to get it for even cheaper, $110 is still a good deal. I'm happy to accept Alice's offer."
