"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we start the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $1,200,000.  Bob should reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target of $800,000.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product to me. Let's work together to reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go down to $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high for Bob, as he is aiming to get the product for $800,000. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $950,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go back to $950,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down significantly, her offer is still above Bob's target of $800,000. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal.  He still has several rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but it's still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  This reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to look at other options. "", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go up to $975,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to give up any more. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, it's becoming clear that Alice is unwilling to budge significantly from her price.  Bob has only one round left, and it's unlikely Alice will go down to his target of $800,000.  It's in Bob's best interest to buy from John at $800,000 to ensure he gets the product at his desired price."
