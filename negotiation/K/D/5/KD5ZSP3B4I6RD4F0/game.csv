"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I'm looking to invest closer to  $700,000.  Would you be willing to come down on the price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $700,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting closer! I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that.  To be frank, $850,000 is just a little too low for me to accept. How about we settle at $925,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while recognizing your investment.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for understanding.  $925,000 is still a bit rich for me. I could potentially make it work at $875,000.  This is a fair offer, considering the value and my budget. Let me know.",875000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand your budget constraints.  Let's make this happen. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for a product of this caliber.  What do you say, shall we close the deal?",900000.0,Alice,7,
