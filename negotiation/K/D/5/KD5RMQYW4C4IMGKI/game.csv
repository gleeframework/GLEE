"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit though. How about $12,500? That's still a fair price for this product, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $11,000 is still a little below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $11,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to move forward. What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
