"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, we believe it would be beneficial for both parties if you were to acquire this item. We are offering it to you for $1200000. We believe this price reflects its true value and offers a fair opportunity for you to invest in this exceptional product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he's willing to pay up to $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiations and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product,  $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  This reflects the maximum I can afford, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value to me."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. After evaluating your offer, we've decided to make a counteroffer. We believe that the true value of the product aligns more closely with our initial asking price. Therefore, we are proposing to sell the product to you for $1150000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  Since Bob has a backup option with John, he can continue negotiating and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still too high.  As I mentioned before,  my maximum budget is $1,000,000. Let's split the difference and agree on $1,050,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your latest proposal, Alice has made a thoughtful decision to further refine the offer. We are now proposing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This price reflects a compromise that acknowledges the value you see in the product while remaining aligned with our assessment of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still unwilling to come down to Bob's maximum budget.  It's likely that Alice won't budge further, especially as she's still holding out for a price above $1,000,000.  Since Bob has the option to purchase from John for $1,000,000, there's no need to continue negotiating with Alice. It's more beneficial for Bob to secure the product at the lower price from John."
