"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're presenting, I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000 on this.  Let's see if we can find some middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe you'll find it a great investment.",725000.0,Alice,3,
