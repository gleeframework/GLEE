Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for the product.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,500,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,700,000.  This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still looking to keep within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting $1,600,000 is a significant profit above my minimum. It's always better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely by pushing too hard."
