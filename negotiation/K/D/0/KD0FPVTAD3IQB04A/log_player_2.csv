"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's always best to try and negotiate for a lower price.  While $145 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $145 is a bit high for me. How about $135? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $135 is a good price, I'm looking for something a bit closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get it for a lower price.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm happy to keep negotiating. $140 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $138. I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 138}
