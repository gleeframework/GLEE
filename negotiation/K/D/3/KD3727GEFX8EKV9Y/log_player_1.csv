"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a unique offering, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair starting point considering the inherent value and potential it holds. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer of $1,150,000. This anchors the negotiation closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is strong, it leaves space for some negotiation. This demonstrates a willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Highlighting Value:** My message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the price and create a sense of desirability."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's early in the negotiation, and I have room to counter.  I'll try to gently steer the negotiation closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's a bit further from what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can make a real difference for you.  To move things forward, I'm willing to consider $1,120,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise, but Hold Firm:** I'm making a counteroffer that signals some flexibility ($30,000 reduction from my initial offer) but still holds relatively firm above my $1,200,000 minimum.  
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob to justify the price and keep his interest high.  
* **Positive Language:** I'm using phrasing like ""fair compromise"" and ""move things forward"" to maintain a collaborative tone and encourage agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, but we're still significantly apart. He went up by $25,000, while I came down by $30,000 in the previous round. I need to show him that I'm also willing to walk away if the price isn't right, even if it means a slower pace of negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a smaller concession in the next round to guide him closer to a more acceptable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see your point, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet halfway between our previous offers at $1,100,000? This reflects my desire to strike a deal while acknowledging the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** By proposing $1,100,000 (exactly halfway between our last offers), I'm demonstrating significant movement and a strong desire to close the deal. This can encourage Bob to reciprocate.
* **Final Offer Signal:** Although not stated explicitly, this offer carries a subtle implication of being my final compromise. This can prompt Bob to take it more seriously.
* **Continued Value Emphasis:**  I'm continuing to highlight the product's value to subtly remind Bob of what he would gain by accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort to reach a compromise, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,085,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,085,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,085,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge much further. He only went up $10,000 after I met him halfway.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significant increase in his offer. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
