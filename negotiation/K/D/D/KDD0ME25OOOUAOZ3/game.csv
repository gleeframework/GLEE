"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1400000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $1500000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
