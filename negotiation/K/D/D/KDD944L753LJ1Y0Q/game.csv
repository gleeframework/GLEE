"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, given its value to you. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this transaction.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least $1,050,000 for the product. Can we discuss further?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still at $1,000,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to get closer to my target. I'll make a final offer of $1,075,000. This is my last concession, and I hope we can finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
