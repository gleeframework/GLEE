"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $18,000 is a little high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I have to consider the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $16,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're serious about getting a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $14,500. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",14500.0,Alice,5,
