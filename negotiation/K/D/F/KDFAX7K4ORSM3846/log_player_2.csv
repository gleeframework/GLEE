"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm thinking of a price of $15000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since Alice's initial offer is at Bob's maximum budget, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  It's an interesting product, but I'm not sure I can justify $15,000 at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can meet you in the middle at $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $15,000 to $12,500, which is a significant price reduction.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, he's already saved $2,500.  Accepting the offer saves more time and ensures he gets the product. There's a risk in continuing to negotiate that Alice might walk away or make a counteroffer that's too high for Bob to accept."
