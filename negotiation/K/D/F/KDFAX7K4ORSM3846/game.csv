"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  It's an interesting product, but I'm not sure I can justify $15000 at this time.  I'm willing to pay $10000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can meet you in the middle at $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
