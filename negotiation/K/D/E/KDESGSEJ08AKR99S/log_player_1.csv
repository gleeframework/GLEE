Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. It's a fantastic deal for a product of this quality. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to the product's true value to me.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 creates a sense of urgency and potential savings for Bob, encouraging him to buy it quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate, potentially increasing my profit margin."
