,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $180 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for it. What do you think?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $160. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little higher than what I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $155? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your point, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $165. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. How about we meet at $162.50? It's a small concession from my original offer, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",162.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to stay within my budget, and $162.50 is a little too high.  I'm willing to go up to $157.50, which is closer to what I can afford.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",157.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $165. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $162.50 and $157.50, which would be $160. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.",160.0,Alice,7,
