"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is close, but I can't go above $10,500. That's my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to be reasonable. However, I have to think about my own costs and profit margins. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. I can sell the product to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  He's already shown his willingness to negotiate and should continue to push for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer gives him more leverage to get closer to his desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to pay $10,750. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can sell the product to you for $10,900. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is getting closer to Bob's preferred price, but it's still a bit higher than his target.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and should continue to push for a lower price.  Rejecting this offer could lead to a more favorable outcome in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting close to my limit, but I can't go higher than $10,800. Let's make this happen. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 10800}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I'm willing to make one more concession, but it's my last one. I can sell the product to you for $10,850. That's the absolute lowest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has reached her final offer at $10,850. While Bob would prefer to pay less, this offer is very close to his target and within his budget.  Given that this is Alice's final offer and there are only 3 rounds remaining, it's a good strategy to accept the offer and avoid the risk of not being able to purchase the product at all.  Furthermore, if Bob rejects this offer, he has to go through a counteroffer process that might result in him having to buy from John at $10,000, which would mean he's essentially wasted several rounds of negotiation."
