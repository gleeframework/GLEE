"I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to meeting in the middle. How about $8,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8000.0,Bob,4,
