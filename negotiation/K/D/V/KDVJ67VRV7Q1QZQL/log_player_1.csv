"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now.  While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm hoping I can get closer to my target price. I'll see if I can negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate.  $7,500 is a bit too low for me, but I'm open to meeting in the middle. How about $8,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $8,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly what the product is worth to me.  Since I'm happy with this price, I'll accept his offer."
