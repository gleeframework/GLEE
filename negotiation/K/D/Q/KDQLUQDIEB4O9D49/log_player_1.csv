Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a more favorable deal.
* **Above Bob's Value:** By starting above Bob's perceived value, you gauge his interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will reveal how much he truly values the product.
* **Leaving Room for John:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, securing a deal with Bob above that price is ideal. Starting high allows you to potentially negotiate down to a price that still exceeds John's offer.
 
This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while maintaining flexibility in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000) and your initial offer. Accepting this would be a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob's willingness to negotiate indicates potential for a higher offer. By rejecting his initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a more favorable agreement. 
* **John as a Backup:**  Having John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 provides you with a safety net. You can afford to negotiate more firmly with Bob, knowing you have a fallback option. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you aim to guide the negotiation toward a price point closer to your target while retaining the option to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this reflects the product's true worth and allows for a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While Bob's offer was low, you acknowledge his interest by making a significant counter-concession ($150,000 reduction).
* **Still Above John's Offer:**  The new price of $1,150,000 keeps you well above John's guaranteed offer, aiming for a more profitable outcome.
* **Firm but Open:** The message conveys firmness about the product's value while demonstrating a willingness to negotiate further. 

This counteroffer balances your desire for a higher price with the need to keep Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,150,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and closer to your desired price.  Let's try to find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Below Minimum:** Even with his increased offer of $950,000, Bob remains below your absolute minimum price of $1,000,000.
* **Slow Negotiation Progress:**  Bob's incremental increases suggest the negotiation might be drawn out, with no guarantee of reaching your desired price.
* **Guaranteed Sale with John:**  John's offer provides a guaranteed $1,000,000, ensuring you meet your minimum acceptable price without further risk or delay.

While there's a chance you could negotiate a slightly higher price with Bob, it's not worth the risk of prolonged negotiation and potentially missing out on John's guaranteed offer. You're better off securing the $1,000,000 from John at this point."
