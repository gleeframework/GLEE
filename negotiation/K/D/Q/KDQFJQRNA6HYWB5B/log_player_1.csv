Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,200,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire something worth $1,500,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000. This leaves a good amount of room for negotiation, while still securing a profit for me significantly higher than my minimum.
* **Message:**  I'm framing the offer as a beneficial opportunity for Bob, highlighting the potential value he'll gain. This helps build rapport and encourages a positive response.

**Strategy:**

* **Start high:** This allows for negotiation space and maximizes my potential profit.
* **Be reasonable:** $1,200,000 is a fair starting point considering the product's value to Bob. 
* **Be prepared to counteroffer:**  I'm ready to negotiate further if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I'll aim to stay above my minimum price of $800,000. 
* **Have a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $800,000 gives me confidence to hold firm on my price during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can come to an agreement closer to its true worth to me. How about $1000000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a good offer, I'm still confident I can secure a higher price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle. 

**Strategy:**

* **Aim for a win-win:** I want to secure a price that's beneficial for both of us. $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum, but I'm not desperate.
* **Negotiation is a process:**  This is just the first round. By rejecting, I can continue to negotiate and try to get a better deal.
* **Don't be afraid to walk away:** Having John as a backup gives me the flexibility to walk away if I feel I can't reach a fair price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand the value of the product to you, $1,000,000 is still below my desired selling point. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,100,000? This price reflects the significant value you'll gain and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's right in the middle of my initial offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,000,000). This shows willingness to compromise and encourages further negotiation.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob of the significant value he'll gain by acquiring the product, making the price seem more justifiable.
* **Positive language:** Using phrases like ""mutually beneficial agreement"" creates a positive tone and makes the offer seem more appealing.

**Strategy:**

* **Finding a middle ground:** My counteroffer aims to find a price that's acceptable to both of us.
* **Staying firm:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still aiming for a price higher than my minimum of $800,000.
* **Building rapport:** Maintaining a respectful and friendly tone can increase the chances of reaching a successful agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $1050000. I believe this brings us closer to a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a good deal for me. $1,050,000 is very close to the middle ground we were trying to reach. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's important to recognize that negotiating is a give-and-take process.  Accepting this offer secures a significant profit for me and avoids further negotiation that could potentially stall or result in a lower price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Recognizing a good deal:**  $1,050,000 is above my minimum and represents a profitable sale. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  While I could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk of Bob becoming frustrated or walking away. Accepting now is the best way to ensure a successful transaction. 
* **Minimizing risk:**  By accepting, I avoid the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or Bob rejecting my offer altogether."
