"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $200. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",200.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $200 is way out of my budget. I'm only willing to pay $80 for this product. Let me know if you're interested in negotiating further.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $200 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $160. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking with my original offer of $80. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to go with John's offer.",80.0,Bob,4,
