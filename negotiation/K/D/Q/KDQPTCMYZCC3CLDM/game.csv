"Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's see if we can make this work.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $950,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is getting closer, I'm still only able to offer $925,000. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  It's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward.",940000.0,Alice,7,
