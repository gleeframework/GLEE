"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $850,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. While it is lower than her initial offer, it is still higher than what you are willing to pay. You can try to negotiate further to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm ready to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in your product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's meet in the middle. How about $950,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to your budget, you can still try to negotiate a lower price.  You're close to your maximum budget, so you need to be careful and not overpay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is getting closer, I'm still only able to offer $925,000. This is my absolute final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is your final offer, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer. $940,000 is very close to your maximum budget, but it's still a good deal considering the value of the product.  You're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and it's unlikely you'll be able to get a significantly lower price.  It's better to close the deal now than risk losing the product to another buyer or having to buy it from John at a higher price."
