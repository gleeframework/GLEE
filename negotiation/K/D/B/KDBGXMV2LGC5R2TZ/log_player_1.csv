"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,200,000). This allows for negotiation and gives me room to make concessions if necessary. It's important to note that I don't know Bob's valuation, so it's a risky but potentially rewarding strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale quickly, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm reducing my offer from $1,500,000 to $1,300,000. This is a significant concession, but still leaves a profit margin above my minimum acceptable value. By showing willingness to compromise, I hope to encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still not satisfied with the price. There's only a $50,000 difference between his offer and what I would get from selling to John. I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price and see if I can get Bob to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm further lowering my price to $1,250,000. This offer is only $50,000 higher than what I would get from selling to John.  Given the limited rounds left, I want to gauge Bob's willingness to close the deal close to my minimum acceptable value. If he rejects this, I will likely accept John's offer."
