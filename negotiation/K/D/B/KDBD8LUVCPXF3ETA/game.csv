,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however.  How about $1,100,000? This price reflects the value of the product while still providing you a good deal.  Let's find a way to make this work!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $1,050,000 is getting closer. However, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,075,000. This gives us both a fair deal and moves us towards finalizing the sale. What do you say?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your willingness to split the difference, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but no more. This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
