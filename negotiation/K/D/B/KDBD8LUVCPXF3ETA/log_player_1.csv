{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Bargaining:**  A $1,300,000 offer allows for some wiggle room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit for me.
* **Confidence and a Clear Message:** The message is concise and conveys confidence in the product's value while highlighting the potential benefit for Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer.  If it's too low, I'll make a counter-counteroffer. 
* If the negotiation stalls or becomes unproductive, I'll always have the option to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While it's a significant jump from his initial valuation, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  Bob's counteroffer indicates he's willing to negotiate, and I believe there's still room to reach a price that's mutually beneficial. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to my desired range. I'll keep in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, however.  How about $1,100,000? This price reflects the value of the product while still providing you a good deal.  Let's find a way to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer moves closer to Bob's offer while still keeping a significant profit margin for myself. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not give away the farm.
* **Positive and Motivating:** My message is positive and encourages Bob to find a way to make the deal work. It focuses on mutual benefit, highlighting the product's value and the opportunity for a good deal.
* **Strategic Compromise:** This offer is a strategic compromise, demonstrating flexibility without jeopardizing my financial goals. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's response to this counteroffer.  If he accepts, great! If he rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to make a further concession or move on to my backup option (John) for the $1,500,000 sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob is getting closer to my desired price point, $1,050,000 is still significantly less than what I'd like to receive for the product. I'm not desperate to sell at this price.
* **Further negotiation is possible:** Bob's counteroffer shows that he's still interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. There's likely room to find a price that's more favorable to me. 
* **Maintaining my leverage:**  By rejecting this offer, I can maintain my position and potentially achieve a better outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round of negotiation and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to secure a price closer to my ideal $1,300,000. I'll continue to consider the option of selling to John if negotiations with Bob become unproductive or too time-consuming."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $1,050,000 is getting closer. However, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,075,000. This gives us both a fair deal and moves us towards finalizing the sale. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1075000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Middle Ground:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($1,050,000). It shows a willingness to compromise while still securing a price closer to my desired range.
* **Emphasis on Finality:** The message highlights the potential for finalizing the sale, encouraging Bob to consider this offer seriously. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm moving closer to Bob's price, I'm still leaving room for him to counter if necessary. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, we finalize the sale. If he rejects, I'll weigh his counteroffer against my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to split the difference, but $1,075,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000, but no more. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  He's declared it his ""final offer,"" which indicates there's little room for further negotiation.
* **Time and Effort:**  The negotiation has gone back and forth for several rounds, and it's becoming clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a significantly higher profit than I'd receive from Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

I'll proceed with selling the product to John for $1,500,000. While it's frustrating to not close the deal with Bob, securing a profit of $700,000 is a positive outcome and a wise decision given the circumstances."
