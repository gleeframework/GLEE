# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product for $1,300,000. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love, and I think this price is a fair reflection of its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Bob should reject the offer. While the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, Alice is willing to sell for less than that. There's room for negotiation to save money."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident that the product's value to you is even higher than that, so I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, so she won't go lower.  While Bob could keep negotiating, there's a risk Alice will walk away or Bob will have to buy from John for a higher price.  At $1,200,000, Bob gets a good deal while securing the product."
