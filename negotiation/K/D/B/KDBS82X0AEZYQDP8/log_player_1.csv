Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired selling price.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
