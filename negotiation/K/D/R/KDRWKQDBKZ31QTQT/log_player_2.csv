"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire this valuable product for a price that is significantly below its true market value. I'm confident it would be a tremendous asset to your company, given its potential to generate substantial profits. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.  This is a price that is more than fair, considering the product's worth to you. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested party willing to pay $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using a common negotiation tactic called ""creating urgency"" by mentioning another interested party. However, her offer of $950,000 is still above your maximum budget and not significantly lower than John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000. By rejecting her offer, you might encourage her to propose a lower price, closer to her own valuation of $800,000. If not, you can always fall back on purchasing from John."
