"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $10,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer of $12,000.  This is a strong starting point for negotiation, and Alice might be willing to accept a price closer to her own valuation of $8,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $15,000. While Bob would prefer a lower price, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a better outcome. Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price while avoiding the risk of a protracted negotiation or a potential stalemate with Alice."
