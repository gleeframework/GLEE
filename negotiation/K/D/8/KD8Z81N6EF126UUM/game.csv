"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I understand you're working within a budget. However, $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm trying to find a price that works for me. $8,500 simply isn't enough for me to sell the product.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but only to $8,750.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a great product at a great price.  Let's make a deal!",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but I'd really like to try to get it for $8,250. Would you be willing to consider that?",8250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $8,250 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer. Let's finalize this deal!",8500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $8,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a better price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000",8000.0,Bob,8,
