"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and conversational tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to pique Bob's interest. 

This strategy aims to start the negotiation strong, leaving space for potential concessions later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push Bob closer to my desired price range. I have several rounds left and selling to John is always an option if I'm unable to reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, and I understand you're working within a budget. However, $7,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $10,000 to $9,000.
* **Reiterate Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $9,000 is still a good deal for him, considering the value of the product.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using positive language to keep the negotiation friendly and encourage a successful outcome. 

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between my minimum price and Bob's offer, hopefully leading to a more agreeable price point in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up from his previous offer, $8,500 is still far below my minimum price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell it that low, especially since I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my desired price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push Bob higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm trying to find a price that works for me. $8,500 simply isn't enough for me to sell the product.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but only to $8,750.  This is a fair compromise, and it gives you a great product at a great price.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm offering a smaller concession this time, only going down to $8,750. This shows I'm serious about getting closer to a deal, but I'm also making it clear that $8,500 is still unacceptable. 
* **Emphasis on Fair Deal:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept.
* **Motivational Language:** I'm using motivational language like ""let's make a deal!"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

This counteroffer aims to test if Bob is willing to budge further. If he rejects it, I'll have to assess whether to continue negotiating with him or simply sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,500, but I'd really like to try to get it for $8,250. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has shown a willingness to move closer to my price, $8,250 is still far below my minimum value of $12,000. I am not willing to sell it that low, especially since I have John as a backup buyer who is willing to pay my desired price. I'll reject this offer and see if I can push Bob higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $8,250 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500, which is a fair compromise. This is my final offer. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm explicitly stating this is my final offer to put pressure on Bob.
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm framing my offer as a compromise, emphasizing fairness to encourage acceptance. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm using language like ""final offer"" and ""let's finalize this deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to act.

At this point, it's a gamble.  If Bob accepts, I get a decent price. If he rejects, I can sell to John and secure my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $8,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if I don't get a better price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is still below my minimum value of $12,000.  I have already made several concessions, and it appears we are at an impasse.  Rather than risk losing more time and potentially getting a lower price, I will sell the product to John for $12,000. This guarantees my desired profit and ensures a quick and successful transaction."
