Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $11,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

It's clear Alice is not budging much from her initial offers. It's unlikely we'll get a price significantly lower than $11,000.  Buying from John at $10,000 is the best option to ensure we stay within budget."
