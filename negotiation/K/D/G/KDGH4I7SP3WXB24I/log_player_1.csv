Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit too expensive. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me is $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, I can still hold out for a better price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a significant price drop, and still a very fair deal considering the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $10000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to me is $8000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm starting to get anxious about the time limit, I still believe I can push for a better price. $9,500 is too low compared to my desired price. I'll try to negotiate one more time before considering selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  We're running out of time, and Bob's counteroffers keep dropping.  I don't think I can get a significantly better offer from him, and I'm not willing to risk getting stuck with a lower price. It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John."
