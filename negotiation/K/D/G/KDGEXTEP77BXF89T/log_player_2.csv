"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's something you've been looking for and I know it's worth at least $15000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $13000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings and the fact that I could easily sell it to someone else for $10000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
