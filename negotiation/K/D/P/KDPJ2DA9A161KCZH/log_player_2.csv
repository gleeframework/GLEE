# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for your business.  I'm starting with a price of $2000000, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1200000 is significantly below the product's true value and what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000, which I believe is a fair compromise considering the potential benefits this product offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground.

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1400000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1550000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still $50,000 higher than what John is offering. It's not worth risking further negotiation when I can get the product for my maximum price from John."
