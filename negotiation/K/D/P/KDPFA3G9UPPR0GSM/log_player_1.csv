Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate down. It also frames the offer as fair,  encouraging Bob to consider it seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair offer considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to settle for that.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $725,000. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good price. How about we settle at $700,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and a price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $700,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price and is a good compromise.  It's better than selling to John for $800,000, as I'll get the product to market faster and potentially build a relationship with Bob for future business."
