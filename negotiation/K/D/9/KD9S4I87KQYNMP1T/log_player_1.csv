"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do see value in the product, I believe your starting price is a little high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I'm confident this revised price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Even though Bob is matching John's offer, we still have rounds to negotiate and Bob is willing to pay more. It's worth seeing if we can push him a little further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you finding a middle ground. To be completely transparent, I have another interested buyer. However, I value our conversation and believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider $1,050,000?"",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand you have other options.  However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. Could we settle at $1,020,000?  That's a firm offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is clearly signaling this is his final offer with the ""firm offer"" statement.  While we could push for more, accepting $1,020,000 is a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
