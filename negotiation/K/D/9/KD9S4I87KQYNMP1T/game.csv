"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I know you'll find immense value in it. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,150,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I do see value in the product, I believe your starting price is a little high. I'd be willing to purchase it for $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I'm confident this revised price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
