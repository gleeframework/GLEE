Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm looking to pay closer to $85.  This would still leave you a nice profit, and it's within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
