"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $100. It's a great value considering its worth to you is $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. I can potentially get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, I'm looking to pay closer to $85.  This would still leave you a nice profit, and it's within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $92 for the product? That's a bit more than my initial offer but still leaves you with a reasonable savings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $92 is a good compromise. It's a bit higher than my initial counteroffer, but it's still significantly lower than John's price of $120. It's also a reasonable profit for Alice, so I'm confident she's not likely to go much lower."
