{""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is willing to pay a bit more than his initial counteroffer, but still wants to save some money.  $15,500 is a compromise that might be acceptable to Alice, but it's still under his maximum budget. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but is also trying to get the best deal possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget. While there's a chance he could negotiate a lower price, it's not guaranteed. Bob's priority is to save money, and John offers the product at his maximum price. This ensures Bob gets the product within his budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might not be fruitful."
