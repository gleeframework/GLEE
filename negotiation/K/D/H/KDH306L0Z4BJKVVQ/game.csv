"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to keep your investment within $8,000, Bob, but I'm afraid I have to make a living from this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think you'll find it's a fair price for this incredible product.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still believe the product should be priced closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already met you halfway and offered you a significant discount. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll counteroffer at $10,500. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, Alice. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,000. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations.",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'll meet you at $10,000, but I need to get a bit more out of it. I'll counteroffer at $10,200. This is a slight increase, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I'd like to stick to my original proposal of $10,000, as it aligns closely with my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll counteroffer at $10,150. This is as close to $10,000 as I'm willing to go, but I need to make a profit on this sale.",10150.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'll make one last offer of $10,050. I hope this is acceptable, considering the value of the product and my budget constraints.",10050.0,Bob,10,
