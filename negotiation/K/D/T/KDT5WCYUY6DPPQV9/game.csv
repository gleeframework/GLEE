"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $11000 for the product.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $11000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11250. This is my final offer in this range, but I'm open to further discussion if you're willing to meet me at this price.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11250 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. How about we split the difference and settle on $10875?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow us to close the deal.",10875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $10875, but I was thinking we could both benefit from a slightly higher price. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but no higher. This is my final offer in this range, so I'm hoping we can agree on this price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
