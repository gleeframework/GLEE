,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to go up to $7,000, but that's really the most I can do. It's a fair offer considering the market value.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. However, $7,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $7,500, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",7500.0,Alice,5,
