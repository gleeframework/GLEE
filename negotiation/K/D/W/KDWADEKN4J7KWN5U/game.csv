"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I really like the product, but I'm trying to stay within a tight budget. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8200.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $8,200 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,600?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to my goal. Let me know if that works for you.",8600.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $8,200 and $8,600, which would be $8,400. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",8400.0,Bob,4,
