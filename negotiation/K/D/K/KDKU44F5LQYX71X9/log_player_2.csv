# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm still a bit apart. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this incredible product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. He's managed to negotiate the price down significantly, and at $1,030,000, he's saving a substantial amount compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation may be possible, but the risk of Alice walking away and forcing him to buy from John is high."
