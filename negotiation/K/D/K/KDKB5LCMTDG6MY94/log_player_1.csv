Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,750,000. Let me know your decision - this offer stands for 24 hours."", 
""product_price"": 1750000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you can afford to start with a significantly higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Time constraint:** Adding a 24-hour time limit creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster.
* **Value-focused message:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob without revealing your own minimum price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an initial offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob.  If he rejects the offer outright, you can always come down in price before the 24 hours are up, knowing you have John as a safety net."
