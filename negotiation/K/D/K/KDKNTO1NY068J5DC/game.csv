"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. How about $12,000? That's a fair compromise, and it still gives you a great deal.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,500? That's the highest I can go, but I'm really interested in making this deal happen.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point about the budget. $11,500 is definitely getting closer.  To make this work for me, I'd need to come down to $11,800.  This is my final offer, and it's a good price for both of us.  What do you say?",11800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,800 is your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $11,600? That's the absolute highest I can go, and I'm really hoping we can make this deal happen.",11600.0,Bob,6,
