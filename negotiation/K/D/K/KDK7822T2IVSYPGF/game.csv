"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is far too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the product.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this transaction. Let's work together to find a solution.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $10,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, as I'm making a significant increase from my previous offer and you're coming down from your previous offer. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10,000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good compromise considering the value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still slightly above what I can afford. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at this price. Let's work together to make this happen.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $10,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good compromise considering the value of the product.",10250.0,Alice,9,
