"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as close to Bob's perceived value as possible.  I want to see if I can get a quick deal, but I'm also prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is a good deal, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price of $14,000.  I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm offering a slight compromise by lowering the price to $13,500. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, I'm confident that I can't get a higher price from Bob.  The negotiations are getting close to my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Selling to Bob for $13,200 is still a good profit for me."
