"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is a decent price, it's still above my budget of $10,000. I'm going to try to negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $11,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I'm still not willing to pay more than $10,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still sticking to my budget of $10,000.  I'm hoping we can find a way to make this work.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,400?"", ""product_price"": 10400}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $10,400 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,700?  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $10,700 is still a bit too high.  Since we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and I'm confident I can get the product from John for $10,000, I'm going to go with the guaranteed lower price."
