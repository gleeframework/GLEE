"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I'll meet you at $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
