Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get a good deal. However, I'm also prepared to negotiate, and I have a backup buyer (John) in case Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Since Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'll accept it to avoid risking a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a deal with John."
