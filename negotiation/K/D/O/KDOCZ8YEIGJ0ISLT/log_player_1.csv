Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $600,000 is a bit low considering the product's value to me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $750,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $950,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
