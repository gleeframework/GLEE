"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for a one-time price of $15,000. I think you'll find it's a great value and will bring significant benefits to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $15,000 is way above his budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Would you be open to that?"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm prepared to pay $10,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's try to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time at $11,500. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob is at his limit. Alice is offering $11,500, which is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  It's better for him to buy the product from John for $8,000 and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
