"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better price, but I have to consider my minimum selling price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1750000? It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still trying to get closer to your budget, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly by offering $1750000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $1800000? It's a bit above your last offer, but I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
