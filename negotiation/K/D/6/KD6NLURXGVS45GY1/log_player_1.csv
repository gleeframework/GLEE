{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $100, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit.  I've also added a friendly message to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer if he's interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price.  I'll see if I can get him to meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down to $90, which is right in the middle of our offers.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you at $85. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is a good compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $80.  It's also closer to my ideal price than my minimum.  I'm going to accept his offer."
