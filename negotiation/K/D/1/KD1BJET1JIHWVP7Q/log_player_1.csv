{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value.  It's a good starting point, leaving room for potential negotiation while still aiming for a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum desired price of $120. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go as low as $110.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $115. This would still give you a great deal on the product, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $112? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $120.  While I could continue negotiating,  it's getting close to my minimum and John is a guaranteed sale at my desired price.  I'm going to sell to John to avoid further haggling."
