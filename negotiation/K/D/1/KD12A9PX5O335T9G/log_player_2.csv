"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $140.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than her own valuation and leaves little room for negotiation. There's a good chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to anchor the negotiation much closer to Alice's valuation. While it's unlikely Alice will accept immediately, it sets the stage for a potentially favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but there's still room for negotiation. Her offer of $125 is still higher than her own valuation.  We can try pushing a little further before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $110? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving while still aiming for a price significantly below Alice's initial offer. It positions us well to either reach a deal or assess if walking away to John's $150 offer is necessary."
