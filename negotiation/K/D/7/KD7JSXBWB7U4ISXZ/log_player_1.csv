Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $110? This is still a great price for the product, and I'm confident you'll be satisfied."", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm selling the product to John. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I've already had multiple rounds of negotiation and I'm running out of time. John is offering a guaranteed $120, which is more than my minimum and a good deal for me."
