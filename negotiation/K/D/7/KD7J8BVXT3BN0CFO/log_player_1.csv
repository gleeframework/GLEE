"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting high, hoping to get as much as possible from Bob.  While $200 is a big markup from my minimum, I'm leaving room to negotiate and still profit.  This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy, but I'm confident I can close the deal with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $160 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get closer to my initial ask with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway with a counteroffer of $180. This is still a good profit for me, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $170
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, and I'm confident I can't get a better deal in the remaining rounds. It's time to close the deal."
