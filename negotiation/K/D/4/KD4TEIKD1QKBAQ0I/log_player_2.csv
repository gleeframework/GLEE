"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, so accepting it won't save you any money.  Rejecting her offer means you can buy from John at the same price.  There's no benefit to buying from Alice in this scenario."
