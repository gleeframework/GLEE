"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $125 is closer to my desired price, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit more.  How about $140? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? That's the highest I'm willing to go.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",135.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your point, but I'm really trying to stick to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $128, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",128.0,Bob,6,
