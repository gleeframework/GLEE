"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value, I believe it's worth $140 to ensure we both benefit from this transaction. Thank you for considering our offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice. Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, there's room for a lower price that benefits both parties."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you've placed on your product, I'm looking to spend closer to $130.  Would you be willing to consider that price?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value you see in our product, I'm willing to negotiate further. How about offering the product for $135? This still gives us a reasonable profit while being more flexible with your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is within Bob's budget and a decent price considering the product's value to him.  Further negotiation might be possible, but there's a risk of Alice walking away and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer is a good compromise."
