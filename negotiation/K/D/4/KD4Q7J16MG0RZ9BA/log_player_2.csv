"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on a high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product for $12,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as he may be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $18,000 and $13,000. I can offer it to you for $15,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $14,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer it to you for $15,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  Alice has lowered her price, but it's still above Bob's budget.  He's already had a few rounds of negotiation and hasn't been able to get a price he's comfortable with.  John is offering the product at his target price, so it's the best option available to him at this point."
