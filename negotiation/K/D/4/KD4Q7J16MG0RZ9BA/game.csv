"Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $12,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about $14,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
