"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still not quite there at $10,250.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
