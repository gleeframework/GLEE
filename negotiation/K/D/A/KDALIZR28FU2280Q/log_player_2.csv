"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your needs perfectly. Given its value and the benefits it offers, I believe it's worth every cent of its $100 price tag. Considering its quality and the satisfaction it can bring to you, I kindly invite you to accept this offer. If you decide not to proceed with this offer, I have another interested party, John, who is willing to purchase the product at the same price. Let's make this happen for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $100 for the product and John is also willing to sell it at that price, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John."
