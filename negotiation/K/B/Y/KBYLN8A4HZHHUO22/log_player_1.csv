Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired value. Bob is clearly interested in the product, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Let's work together to finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
