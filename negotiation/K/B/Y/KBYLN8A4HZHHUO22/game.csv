"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I recognize the value you see in the product,  $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the full potential it holds for you. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still offers significant value for you, while also allowing me to achieve a reasonable return on my investment. Let's work together to finalize this deal!",1050000.0,Alice,3,
