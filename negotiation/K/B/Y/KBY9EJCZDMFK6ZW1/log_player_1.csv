{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You want at least $12,000, and $14,000 gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he'll likely see this as a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** You state your price directly and invite Bob to respond.

By offering a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, you increase the likelihood of him accepting the offer. However, you also have room to negotiate if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While you want to make a deal with Bob, you shouldn't accept an offer that undervalues the product.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer that is more in line with your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

This counteroffer is a good compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:**  You're not accepting his initial price, but you're showing flexibility.
* **It's lower than your original offer:** This signals that you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's still within your acceptable range:** $13,000 is above your minimum of $12,000.

By offering a price that's a midpoint between your previous offer and Bob's offer, you increase the likelihood that you'll reach a deal that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're firm on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **You're at your minimum:**  Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price.
* **It's a fair compromise:**  You've both made concessions, and this price is a good meeting point.
* **There's no guarantee of a better offer:**  You could keep negotiating, but there's no guarantee that Bob will budge further or that you'll get a better offer.  

While you could potentially get a higher price by continuing to negotiate, there's a risk of losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures you get your desired price and a sale, which is a positive outcome."
