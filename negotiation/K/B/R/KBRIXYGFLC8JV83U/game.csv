"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here.",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $10,200. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",10200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,200 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,000. This is a fair price considering we both know the product's true value. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at $9,000. I'm willing to make another concession and counteroffer at $10,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a good compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,5,
