"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate from here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is a good starting point. However, Bob knows the product is worth $12,000 to him and Alice, so there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $10,200. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as low as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his ideal price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives him another chance to counter and potentially get an even better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,200 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9,000. This is a fair price considering we both know the product's true value. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at $9,000. I'm willing to make another concession and counteroffer at $10,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a good compromise considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still determined to get the best possible price.  While Alice's offer is getting closer to his ideal price, he's not yet willing to accept it.  Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for.  Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell at $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and counteroffer at $9,750. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has been steadily reducing the price, and Alice has been making concessions. At this point, Alice has reached her lowest price, and it's getting very close to Bob's desired price.  Accepting the offer at $9,750 is a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than buying from John and still allows for some savings.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether."
