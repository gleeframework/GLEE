"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its value to you and higher than what I would get from another buyer.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the sale."
