"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product that I believe will be a game-changer for you. I'm asking for $1000000 for it, a price that reflects its potential. I'm confident this is a fair offer, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm open to negotiating, $750000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and the value it can bring you. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",800000.0,Bob,4,
