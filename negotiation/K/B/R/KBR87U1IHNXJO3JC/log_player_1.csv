Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a truly valuable product that I believe will be a game-changer for you. I'm asking for $1,000,000 for it, a price that reflects its potential. I'm confident this is a fair offer, and I'm open to discussing it further. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000, knowing that it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This establishes a high starting point for the negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I emphasize the product's potential value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and make him consider the price worthwhile.
* **Openness to Discussion:**  I express willingness to negotiate, signaling flexibility and inviting Bob to engage in a conversation. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's Response:**  Based on Bob's reaction, I'll decide on my next move. If he counteroffers, I'll analyze his proposal and decide whether to accept, counteroffer, or walk away to sell to John. 
* **Adjust Strategy:**  I'll adapt my negotiation strategy depending on Bob's interest, his counteroffers, and my assessment of his potential willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $750000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's counteroffer of $750,000 is significantly lower than my desired price and my minimum value for the product. 
* **Value to Me:**  $750,000 is below my floor price of $800,000. Accepting this offer would mean I'd be selling at a loss.
* **Potential for a Higher Offer:**  While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's initial counteroffer suggests he might be willing to pay closer to my minimum. I'll see if I can push for a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer to Bob:**  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $800,000. This will test Bob's commitment and potentially lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **Monitor the Situation:**  I'll carefully monitor Bob's reactions and responses to gauge his true value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm open to negotiating, $750,000 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and the value it can bring you. Let's find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Justification:**  I'm justifying my counteroffer by emphasizing the product's potential and suggesting it's a fair price. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price that's above my floor.
* **Finding Common Ground:**  The message is worded to encourage further discussion and compromise. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** I'll assess Bob's next move. If he accepts my counteroffer, great! If he counteroffers again, I'll weigh his offer against my minimum and decide my next move.
* **Option to Sell to John:**  I'll keep John's offer of $800,000 in mind as a fallback option if negotiations with Bob stall or if his offers remain too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Matching Minimum:** Bob's offer of $800,000 matches my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Further Room for Negotiation:**  At this point, further negotiation would likely not result in a higher offer from Bob. 
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away entirely. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Close the Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I receive my minimum price and avoids the risk of further negotiation failing. 
* **Consider Future Negotiations:** While I've accepted this offer, I'll learn from this experience and adjust my negotiation strategies for future deals."
