# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100.

``` 

Alice's offer is higher than our ideal price. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

We're starting with a counteroffer slightly above Alice's value. This leaves room for further negotiation while still being significantly below Alice's initial offer and our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $92.50 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $92.50 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you be willing to consider $88?"",
""product_price"": 88
}
``` 

We're edging closer to a potential agreement. Our counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Alice's price while still staying under $90."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $90, but I think I can do a bit better than that. How about we meet at $91? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is still holding above $90. We're getting close to the point where we might consider accepting, but another round of negotiation could be beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. $91 is close, but I'm still hoping to land closer to $90. How about we split the difference and settle at $89.50?"",
""product_price"": 89.50
}
``` 

We're making a final push for a price below $90. This offer shows we're serious and willing to compromise, but not at the cost of going over our ideal budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $91 and $89.50, which is $90.25. I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $90. This offer is a reasonable compromise, saving us almost $10 compared to John's price and a significant amount compared to her initial offer."
