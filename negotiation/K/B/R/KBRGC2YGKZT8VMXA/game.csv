"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1000000 is still a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Given the value to me, I'd be comfortable offering $850000. This allows us both to achieve a fair outcome. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $950000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your compromise, but $950000 is still a bit more than I can justify. I'm willing to go up to $900000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good outcome. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is getting closer to my target, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925000. This allows us both to achieve a fair outcome without compromising too much on our individual needs. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a good price, but $925000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $910000, which represents a compromise from both of us. This allows us to achieve a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let me know what you think.",910000.0,Bob,6,
