"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $12,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's find a middle ground.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $15,000, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal, I think this is a good price for the value you'll receive. ",15000.0,Alice,5,
