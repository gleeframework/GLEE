The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $100. This is a good price, but you can try to get it for even less.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."

The product is worth $120 to me, and Alice is offering it for $95.  This is a good deal and getting closer to my ideal price. It's not worth risking losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price."
