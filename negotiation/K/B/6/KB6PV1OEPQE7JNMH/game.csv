"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially far exceeding $1200000.  While I can't disclose specifics about the product at this time, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for the right buyer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This price reflects the potential value I see in the product, but I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
