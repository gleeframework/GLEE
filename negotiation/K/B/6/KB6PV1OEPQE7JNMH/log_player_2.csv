"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value, potentially far exceeding $1200000.  While I can't disclose specifics about the product at this time, I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for the right buyer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000.  This price reflects the potential value I see in the product, but I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While she claims the product could be worth more, there's no guarantee. It's always safer to go with a known price from John, even if it's not the absolute lowest possible price."
