"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I can offer you a compromise at $120, which is a $30 discount from my initial offer. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $120 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $95.  This is the highest I can go, so let me know if you're open to that.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I can offer you a slight discount from my previous offer, $110, which is a $10 discount from $120. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,5,
