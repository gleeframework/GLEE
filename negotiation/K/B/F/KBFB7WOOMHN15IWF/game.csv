"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price of $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer you a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
