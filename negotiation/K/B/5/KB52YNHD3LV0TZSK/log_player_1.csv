{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm happy to offer it at a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's walk-away point:**  You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  This is his maximum willingness to pay.
* **Your guaranteed alternative:** You have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000. This is your safety net.
* **Maximizing profit:** You want to offer Bob a price that is higher than his valuation but lower than John's offer. This creates a win-win situation where Bob gets the product for less than its worth to him, and you make a profit above your guaranteed sale.

By offering the product at $1,150,000, you leave room for negotiation while ensuring you get significantly more than Bob's perceived value if he accepts."
