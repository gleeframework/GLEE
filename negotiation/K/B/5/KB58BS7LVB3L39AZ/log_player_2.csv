"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $120 to Bob,  $140 is too high. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is close to his maximum value but leaves some room for negotiation.  This strategy aims to get Alice to consider a lower price while still demonstrating Bob's interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand it's a bit less than my initial price. I'm willing to come down to $135. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to Bob's maximum value, he can still try to get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $135 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $130?  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price while recognizing that Alice is also trying to get a good deal. By offering to split the difference, Bob is showing a willingness to compromise and potentially reach an agreement. This approach could increase the chances of Alice accepting the counteroffer."
