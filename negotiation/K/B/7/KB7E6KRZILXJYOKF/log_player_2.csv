"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $120.**  This is within your budget of $150.
* **Buying from John costs $150.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Therefore, it makes more financial sense to accept Alice's offer and save $30."
