"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. Let's meet in the middle at $1,300,000. This still gives you a great deal, and it allows me to get closer to the value I see in this product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come away with a good deal.  Let's find a resolution at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still not quite where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.  I hope we can reach an agreement at this point.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
