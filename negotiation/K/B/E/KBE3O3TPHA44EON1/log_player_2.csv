"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's a great deal at $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $80 from John. Rejecting this offer keeps the door open for a better deal from Alice or allows you to proceed with your backup plan."
