,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and allowing for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $950000 is certainly a good offer, it's a bit below what I need to achieve my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1025000. This price still provides a strong value for you, and it allows me to move forward with this deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $1025000 is closer to where I need to be. However, I'm still hoping to finalize this deal at a lower price. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm prepared to offer $987500 for the product.  This price is a fair midpoint between our current positions, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",987500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  $987500 is a step closer, but it's still not quite in the range I need to make this deal work.  I'm prepared to come down to $1000000. This price reflects the significant value this product offers you, and it's a fair compromise that I believe allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're making good progress! I see your commitment to finding common ground. While $1000000 is a very fair offer, I'm still hoping to close this deal at $987500. This is a strong offer that reflects the value of the product for me and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  I believe a little more compromise on your end will make this happen for both of us.",987500.0,Bob,6,
