"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, you can likely get a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows you to start negotiating and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120 but still leaves room for negotiation.  This demonstrates my willingness to bargain while still keeping a reasonable price in mind.  This price point also leaves room for Alice to counter while still potentially profiting more than selling to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $130 is still too high. While it's closer to my desired price, there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to continue bargaining to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $110, which is closer to Alice's last offer of $130.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to keep the price as low as possible.  This is a good middle ground that Alice might accept, avoiding the need to go through further rounds of negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $140 is still too high.  While I'm nearing my maximum budget of $150, I'm not desperate to purchase the product.  There's still a small amount of room to negotiate with Alice.  I'll make one more counteroffer before deciding to buy from John if Alice doesn't accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer before I consider buying from John. I'm increasing my offer to $125, which is a significant jump from my previous offer of $110. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but am still trying to get a good deal. Hopefully, Alice will accept this offer, as it still represents a decent profit for her, but I'm prepared to move on to John if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $145 is too close to John's price of $150.  At this point, there's not much room for negotiation, and I'm likely to reach my budget limit if I continue.  It's more advantageous to purchase from John as it's a quicker and simpler solution.  While the price is slightly higher, it saves me the time and effort of further negotiation, which might not lead to a significant price decrease."
