"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1500000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident the potential returns will justify the price. Let's discuss further.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it, but I'm not sure I can go any higher. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1200000 is still too low. I'm prepared to come down to $1400000.  This is a significant offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the compromise, but I still think $1400000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1300000. Can you consider this offer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're close, but $1300000 is still too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see $1350000 for this deal to be viable.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can agree.",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to find a fair price. I'm willing to make one final concession and offer $1300000. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options. This is my final offer.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
