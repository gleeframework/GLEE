"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $100, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer.  You should try to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  If not, you can always buy from John."
