Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for this product. I believe that's a fair offer considering its current market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but $900,000 is still too high for me. I can offer $700,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is unlikely to reach our minimum price. He's incrementing his offers in $100,000 steps. We're currently at $700,000, and even with several more rounds, he might not reach the $800,000 mark. John offers a guaranteed $800,000, which is our minimum acceptable price. It's better to take the sure thing than risk Bob not meeting our valuation."
