"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm really serious about getting this product, and I'm willing to pay $12,000.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product from another seller for $10,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty about being able to get the product from another seller for $10,000, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for that price. However, I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but I'll throw in a small bonus to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and support package worth $1,000. So, the total price would be $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",13000.0,Alice,5,
