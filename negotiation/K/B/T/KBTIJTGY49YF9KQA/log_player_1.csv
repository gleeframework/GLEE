Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  It also highlights the potential benefit for Bob while ensuring I still get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I need to see if I can get closer to my goal through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $11,500 to make this worthwhile. Let's keep the conversation going, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. Considering your latest offer and my budget, I am willing to propose a price of $11,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within the range you're considering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would prefer $11,500, $11,000 is a good compromise and getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob and ending up with nothing.  Selling to John is also an option, but I'm not sure I want to miss out on the potential of a deal with Bob."
