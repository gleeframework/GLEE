Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product at $1,000,000 (Bob's value) is leaving money on the table. Offering it at $1,200,000 leaves no incentive for Bob. 
* **The Sweet Spot:**  The offer of $1,150,000 aims for a price that's appealing to Bob (a $150,000 gain over his perceived value) while still netting you a significant profit ($150,000 more than John's offer).
* **Urgency:** Adding a time limit encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially prevents him from overthinking or trying to negotiate further."
