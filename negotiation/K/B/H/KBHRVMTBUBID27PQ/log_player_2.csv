"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best financial decision."
