"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget considerations, but $900,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair offer reflecting the immense potential of this product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm proposing $1,175,000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing further if you're willing to budge.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
