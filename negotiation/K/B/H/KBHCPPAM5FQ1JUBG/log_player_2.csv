{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly in price, and her offer is now within a reasonable range for me.  While I would love to get it for closer to $11,250, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  At $11,400, it's still a good value compared to John's offer of $10,000, and I think it's a reasonable compromise."
