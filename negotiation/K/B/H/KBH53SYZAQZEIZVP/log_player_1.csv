"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm aiming to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in a serious negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm offering $1,200,000, which is still above my minimum but a significant drop from my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject it again, but I'm feeling the pressure to start closing the deal. I might be more flexible with my counteroffer this time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm offering $1,000,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John.  I'm hoping he'll finally accept, as we've been through a few rounds now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and we're running out of time.  It's not worth risking another rejection and potentially ending up with nothing.  $1,000,000 is a guaranteed profit and secures my minimum value."
