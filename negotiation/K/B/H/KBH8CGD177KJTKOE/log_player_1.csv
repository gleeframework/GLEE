Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I believe it's a great deal and would be very useful for you."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to make the most money possible. While she has a guaranteed $150 from John, selling to Bob for more would be ideal.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering the product at $140 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer while still staying above Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Proposition:** The message highlights that the price is a ""great deal,"" subtly suggesting it's worth more than Bob's perceived value of $120. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between:

1. **Securing a Sale:** Offering a price significantly closer to Bob's valuation increases the likelihood of acceptance.
2. **Maximizing Returns:** The price remains significantly higher than Bob's valuation, aiming for the highest possible profit."
