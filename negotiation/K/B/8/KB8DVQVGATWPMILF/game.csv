"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the initial price of $1,800,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly exceptional, and $1,400,000 falls short of what I believe is fair.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,650,000. I'm confident this price reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",1650000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,650,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000.
