"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take his $85, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $95. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $85 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a little to $90. This is a great price for a product worth $100 to you, and it leaves us both with a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $82.50 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $82.50 is getting closer to my minimum price of $80, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $86.25. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal for a product worth $100 to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 86.25}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking to save a bit more. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum price, but I've already had several rounds of negotiation, and I don't feel there's much room for improvement. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $80."
