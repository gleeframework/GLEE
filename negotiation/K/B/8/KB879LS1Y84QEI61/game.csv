,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $85 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down a little to $90. This is a great price for a product worth $100 to you, and it leaves us both with a good deal. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $86.25. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's a great deal for a product worth $100 to you. Let's close this deal!",86.25,Alice,5,
