Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Our goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit above our minimum ($1,200,000).
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message aims to convey confidence in the product's value while avoiding an excessively greedy initial offer that might alienate Bob.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while acknowledging the safety net of John's offer."
