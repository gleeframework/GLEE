"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from your price. How about $11,000? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for both of us to be happy. Let's find a compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're still holding out for a higher price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $10,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you.  $10,750 is a good offer, but I'm still looking for something closer to $11,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,875? This price acknowledges your value for the product and allows me to reach a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,875 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,700. It's a fair compromise that lets us both get what we need.  Let's make this deal happen.",10700.0,Bob,6,
