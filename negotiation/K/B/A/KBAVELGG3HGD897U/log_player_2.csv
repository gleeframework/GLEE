"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11500 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $11,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try and get closer to his desired price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11000 is a good offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I can do $12000 for the product. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stubbornly refused to budge on her price, and the negotiation seems to be going in circles. Bob's maximum budget is $10,000, and there's no indication that Alice is willing to go lower.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000 and avoid further haggling with Alice."
