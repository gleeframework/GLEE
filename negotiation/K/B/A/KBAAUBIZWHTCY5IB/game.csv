"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product! I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $11,000. Would that work for you?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $18,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering your budget, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my ideal range.  Would you be open to $12,000? That would be a comfortable price point for me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is still a good price for the product. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
