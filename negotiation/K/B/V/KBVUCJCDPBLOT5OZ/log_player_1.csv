Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. I think it's a great deal for something of this value, and I'm hoping we can make a deal."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. Offering the product just below her guaranteed sale price to John ($15,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Urgency and Value:** The message implies some urgency (""hoping we can make a deal"") and emphasizes the perceived value to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of Bob countering with a slightly lower offer, still leaving Alice with a significant profit."
