"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, though. How about $10,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, which is the lowest I can go. It's the minimum I need to make this deal worthwhile for me.",12000.0,Alice,5,
