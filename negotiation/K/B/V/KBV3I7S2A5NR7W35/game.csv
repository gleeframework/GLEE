"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the initial gesture, but $1200000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $850000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows for a comfortable profit for you.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not ready to accept $850000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $1100000. It's a fair price that still reflects its value to me, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1100000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900000. This price is a reasonable compromise, allowing you to gain a significant profit while still staying within my budget. I believe this offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product holds for both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
