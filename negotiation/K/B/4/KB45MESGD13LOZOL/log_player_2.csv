"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would greatly benefit you. This product holds immense value to me, but I understand its potential worth to you might be even greater. I am offering this product to you at a special price of $900,000. I trust that this offer reflects both the value of the product and my desire to facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction. I look forward to discussing this further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your $1,000,000 maximum price and cheaper than buying from John."
