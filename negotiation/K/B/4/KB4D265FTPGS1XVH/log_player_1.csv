{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **My Floor:** I won't go below $1,200,000, so I need to start higher than that.
* **Bob's Ceiling:** He values the product at $800,000, so I can't expect to get much more than that.
* **Negotiation Room:** $1,000,000 provides a good starting point for negotiation, giving us both room to maneuver. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a backup buyer at $1,200,000, so I have the luxury of being somewhat flexible with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900,000. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is closer to my minimum:** While $900,000 is closer to my minimum of $1,200,000, it's still significantly less than what I'd like to get. 
* **Negotiation room:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my desired amount. 
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 with John, so I can afford to be more patient and try to get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $950,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my initial price, but still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Mid-point:** $950,000 is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000.
* **John's offer:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, as I can easily walk away if this negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $920,000. Can you consider it?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $920,000 is still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Small difference:** The difference between $920,000 and my last offer of $950,000 is only $30,000. It's unlikely I'll get a much higher offer from Bob.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 with John. I'm better off selling to John and avoiding further negotiation with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $920,000 is still too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $940,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price again, but staying above Bob's latest offer.
* **Small Adjustment:** The difference between $940,000 and my previous offer of $950,000 is only $10,000. It's a small adjustment, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **John's Offer:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, but I'm also trying to see if I can get a better deal with Bob before accepting it."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my floor:** Bob's offer of $910,000 is getting close to my minimum of $1,200,000, but it's still significantly lower than what I'd like.
* **Time is money:** Continued negotiation is time-consuming and potentially draining.  I've already made significant concessions.
* **John's offer:** I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 with John.  It's more beneficial to sell to John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob that may not result in a better price."
