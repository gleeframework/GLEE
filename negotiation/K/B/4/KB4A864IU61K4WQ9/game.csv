"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a serious buyer. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $22000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,

"I think we're really close now, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $19200, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm going to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, and I'll sell it to you for $19500. This is my final offer, what do you say?",19500.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate the extras you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $19500. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $19000. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept the deal. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $15000.",19000.0,Bob,10,
