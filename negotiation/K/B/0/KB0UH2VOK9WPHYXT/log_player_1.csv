"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal for you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150).**  Accepting $60 would mean losing a substantial amount of money.
* **I have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate.**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but it's not the best outcome.**  I'd prefer to negotiate with Bob if possible, as I could potentially get a better price than $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, $60 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $120. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit much for my budget. Could we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.**  While it's closer, $90 is still a significant loss for me.
* **I have 6 rounds remaining (10 total - 4 rounds passed).**  This gives me time to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **Selling to John is always an option, but it's still not the best outcome.**  I'd prefer to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground that's closer to my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but $90 is just too low for me. How about $105?  That's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable, but I can't justify going over $80 for this product. If you can do $80, I'm ready to buy right now. Otherwise, I think I might have to check out other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer of $80 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.** This means I would be losing money if I accepted.
* **I have 4 rounds left, but the negotiations seem to be stagnating.** Bob is firm on his price, and further counteroffers are unlikely to be successful.
* **Selling to John for $150 is the best option at this point.**  It guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation that might not result in a better deal."
