Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm asking for $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and allows me to potentially achieve a higher price. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to create a good rapport with Bob. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the potential value of the product to Bob. 

I'm hoping Bob will counter-offer. If he doesn't, I can always go to John after a few rounds."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500

```
