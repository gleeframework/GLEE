"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a better price than $1,000,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is still a good profit for Alice, and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. It's also a price that Bob is comfortable with, as it's lower than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $975,000 is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but still higher than what he's willing to pay right now. There's still room for negotiation, and continuing to counteroffer could lead to a lower price.  While buying from John is an option, it's not the most economical choice at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is willing to increase his offer slightly, showing he's serious about making a deal with Alice. However, $900,000 is still a significant savings compared to John's offer and leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects. It's a strategic move to demonstrate flexibility without giving away too much ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $990,000 is very close to John's price of $1,000,000.  While continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly lower price, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice is high. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are not worth the risk of losing the deal entirely.  It's more prudent to accept John's offer, as it guarantees Bob gets the product at a price that's still within his budget."
