"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Can you meet me at $107? I'm willing to compromise, but I really want to stay within my budget.",107.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to meet me in the middle, but $107 is still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $109. This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go down to $109, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $109, which would be $104.50. Can you consider that?",104.5,Bob,6,
