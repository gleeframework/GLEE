"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a strong starting point for the negotiation. I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me, so I have room to negotiate.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium.  

I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiations with Bob fall through.  This gives me some leverage and helps me to be more confident in my negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I won't settle for anything less than $8,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up with a more reasonable price.  I'll send him a counteroffer in the next round.  

I'm still keeping in mind the option to sell to John for $8,000. This keeps me grounded and gives me confidence to hold firm on my negotiation strategy.  I'm not in a rush to sell the product, so I have the time to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.  I believe Bob will be more willing to negotiate after his initial low offer was rejected. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to him.  

I'm also keeping in mind that I can sell to John for $8,000 if this negotiation fails. This gives me the flexibility to walk away if I'm not satisfied with the outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $6,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still too low. I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly less than what I know the product is worth.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get Bob to come up with a better price.  

I'm still holding onto the option to sell to John for $8,000, which gives me a strong safety net. This keeps me focused on achieving a good deal with Bob, but also allows me to walk away if the negotiations don't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a reasonable price given the product's value.  I believe this offer is close enough to my minimum value that Bob might be willing to accept it. 

I'm aware that I can sell to John for $8,000, but I'm hoping to get a bit more from Bob if possible.  However, I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob continues to refuse to meet me halfway.  I'm confident in my negotiation strategy and won't settle for anything less than what the product is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I would love to get closer to my initial asking price,  Bob's offer of $7,000 is very close to my minimum value and represents a significant increase from his previous offers. With only 4 rounds left, it's risky to keep rejecting and potentially end up with nothing.  I believe accepting this offer will be the most financially beneficial decision.  

I'm also aware that I could sell to John for $8,000, but that would mean missing out on an opportunity to potentially close a deal with Bob.  I'm taking a calculated risk by accepting this offer, but I believe it's the best option at this point in the negotiation."
