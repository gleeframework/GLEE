"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product.  I'm interested, but $180 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $180 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering the product to you for $160. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $160 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. Could we do $130?",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I've already come down a significant amount from my initial offer. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm offering the product to you for $145. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",145.0,Alice,5,
