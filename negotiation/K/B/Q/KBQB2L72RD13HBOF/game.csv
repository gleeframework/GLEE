"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am not able to meet the price of $2,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000? This reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still unable to meet the price of $2,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,900,000. I hope this is closer to what you're considering.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
