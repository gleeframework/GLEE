{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe you'll find it to be a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product to Bob for $119, you maximize your potential profit while still ensuring Bob gets a deal. He saves $1 compared to his valuation, making it highly likely he'll accept. If he rejects, you can still sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
