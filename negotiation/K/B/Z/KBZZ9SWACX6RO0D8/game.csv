"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $110.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,4,

"I like that you're willing to compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm still a bit above the middle ground, but I think it's a fair price for the quality of the product.",115.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference and land at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,6,

"I see you're really trying to get a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $110 again, but I'll throw in an extra incentive - I'll include a free accessory that's worth $20. So, the total value you'll get is $130. I think that's a great offer, considering the product is worth $150 to you.",110.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the offer with the accessory, Alice. However, I'm on a tight budget and need to keep the price down.  Would you consider $105 without the accessory?",105.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you like the accessory idea, Bob! However, I'm not willing to give it away for free. I can offer it to you for $105, and the product will be $90. That way, you'll still get a great deal, and I'll make a fair profit.",90.0,Alice,9,
