"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its worth to you and still a decent profit for me. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $7,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $8,500 is my absolute bottom line.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we meet at $8,000? I'm willing to pay a bit more than my initial offer, but I really need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,4,
