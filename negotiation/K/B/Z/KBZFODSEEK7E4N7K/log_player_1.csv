Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to  $600,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the adjusted offer. I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, anything above $700,000 would be really stretching my budget at this point. How about we settle at $680,000? That's a significant investment on my end, but I think it could work for us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $680,000.

It's a unique item with the potential to significantly impact your business. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to agree on $1,600,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground.  However, that price is still quite a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  I believe that represents a fair deal considering the overall market and my current budget. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently offering prices far below the product's value to you. He's unlikely to drastically increase his offer in the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees you your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's time to cut your losses with Bob and secure a guaranteed profit."
