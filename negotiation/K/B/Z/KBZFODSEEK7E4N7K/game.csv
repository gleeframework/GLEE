"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me right now. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to  $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's inherent value and potential ROI warrant a higher investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the long-term benefits it can provide.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the adjusted offer. I appreciate you working with me.  To be honest, anything above $700,000 would be really stretching my budget at this point. How about we settle at $680,000? That's a significant investment on my end, but I think it could work for us both.",680000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints, but the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. It's a unique item with the potential to significantly impact your business. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to agree on $1,600,000. This offer represents a considerable reduction on my end while still acknowledging the product's worth.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a middle ground.  However, that price is still quite a stretch for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000.  I believe that represents a fair deal considering the overall market and my current budget. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,6,
