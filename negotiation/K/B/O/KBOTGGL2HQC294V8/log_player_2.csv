```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9000. I can do $10500. Would you be willing to meet me there?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  While it's closer to his desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500 is not possible, but I can do $10250. That's as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,250 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. While it's very close, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000. This ensures he stays within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
