"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Bob is willing to pay a maximum of $120 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, there's no reason to negotiate with Alice.  Buying from John guarantees the product at the desired price."
