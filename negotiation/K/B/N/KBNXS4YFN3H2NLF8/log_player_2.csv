"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $120 to me, but Alice is only asking for $100. I can likely get a better deal, so I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
