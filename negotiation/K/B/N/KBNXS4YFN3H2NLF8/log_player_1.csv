"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate and maximizes my potential profit.
* **Friendly opening:** I want to start the negotiation on a positive note.  
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** By not going for the full $120 right away, I create the possibility for Bob to counteroffer and hopefully find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good compromise:** Bob's offer of $90 is significantly closer to my desired price of $100.  Accepting it would be a good compromise and secure a sale quickly.
* **Time is money:** While I could potentially get a higher price by continuing negotiations, there's no guarantee.  It's better to secure a profit than risk losing the deal entirely.
* **John's offer:**  While John is a backup, Bob's offer is more lucrative.  There's no reason to risk selling for less when a better deal is on the table."
