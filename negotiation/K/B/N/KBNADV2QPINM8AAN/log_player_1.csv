Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $2,000,000. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  A starting price of $2,000,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Confident language:** The message uses positive language (""exclusive opportunity"", ""incredible value"") to frame the offer attractively.
* **Clear expectation:** The message directly states the price you're aiming for, leaving no ambiguity.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit with Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer. If Bob rejects the initial price, you can:

1. **Negotiate:** Gauge his interest and potentially lower the price incrementally. 
2. **Walk away:** If Bob isn't willing to meet a price significantly above $1,500,000, you can confidently sell to John."
