"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,050,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's a fair price for me.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we settle at $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's aim for a number that works for both of us.  I'm willing to drop to $975,000. This would be a good deal for you, and it would be closer to the value I need to get for the product.  What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting us closer.  I'm willing to move a bit to meet you.  Would you be open to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,6,
