"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but my budget is $10,000. I'd be willing to pay $12,000 for it right now.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $16,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value I see in this product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $12,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm going to make a new offer of $14,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still above my limit.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if it's not accepted.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're close to walking away, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $14,000, so I'm offering you $13,500. This is my last offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
