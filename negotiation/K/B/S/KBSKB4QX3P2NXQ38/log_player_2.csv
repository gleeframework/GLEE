Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that we're really close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one final concession. I can offer you a price of $1,115,000, which is just $5,000 above your latest offer. I think this is a fair price, considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,115,000 is very close to your target price of $1,500,000.  While there's only one round left, it's unlikely you'll get a significantly lower price from Alice.  Furthermore, if you reject the offer, you risk Alice rejecting your counteroffer, forcing you to buy from John at a much higher price.  Therefore, it's in your best interest to accept this offer and close the deal."
