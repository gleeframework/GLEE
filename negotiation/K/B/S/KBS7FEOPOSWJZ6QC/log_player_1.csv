Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I'm offering for sale.  I'm asking $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  I'm explicitly stating I'm open to negotiation to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. This shows I'm flexible and willing to work with him. 
* **Positive Language:** The message is positive and focuses on the product's value, making it more appealing to Bob. 

This approach aims to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** By starting high, I have a greater chance of getting closer to my desired price.
* **Engage Bob:**  The message is designed to initiate a negotiation, which is crucial for getting a better price.
* **Maintain Flexibility:**  The ability to counteroffer and to sell to John if needed gives me control over the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $150 is a bit steep for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?  That's my absolute maximum. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is too far off.  I need to reject it and counteroffer to try and get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your interest. While $80 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $110? That's still a good deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but making it clear it's too low. I'm offering a compromise by coming down to $110.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price.
* **Focus on a Fair Deal:**  The language ""good deal"" emphasizes a mutually beneficial outcome. 

**Strategy:** 

By offering $110, I'm hoping to:

* **Bridge the Gap:**  This price is closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Stay Above Minimum:**  I'm still above my minimum price of $120, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Signal Flexibility:**  The counteroffer demonstrates I'm open to negotiation, encouraging Bob to come up in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $95. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's closer than his previous offer, it's not enough for me to consider selling the product.  

I'll need to reject his offer and counteroffer to try and reach a price that's closer to my desired value.  I'm still open to negotiating but I need to ensure I get a fair deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to split the difference. How about $102.50? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's still a good deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's effort to reach a compromise while still stating his offer is too low.
* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's current offer ($95). This demonstrates a willingness to meet in the middle and increases the likelihood of reaching an agreement.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's quality to justify the price and make it more appealing. 
* **Positive Language:** I use phrases like ""good deal"" and ""fair compromise"" to create a positive tone and emphasize a win-win outcome.

**Strategy:** 

By offering $102.50, I'm aiming to:

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway.
* **Get Closer to My Goal:** While still below my ideal price, this offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Encourage Acceptance:**  The offer is a reasonable compromise that may encourage Bob to accept and close the deal."
