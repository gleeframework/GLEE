Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price significantly higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation and potential compromise with Bob. This way, I'm not giving away too much value upfront but also showing willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price range.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11000}
