"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it works for me.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and my needs. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
