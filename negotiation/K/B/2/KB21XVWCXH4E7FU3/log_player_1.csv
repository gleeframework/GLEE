{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a bit higher than Bob's valuation, but it leaves room for negotiation and avoids immediately resorting to John's offer. This strategy allows for potential profit while still leaving room for a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's worth more to me than that, and I can get a better price from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? That's still a good deal for you, and it works for me."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $60 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than $60, it's still far from the $150 I can get from John. I'm going to try to push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $75 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price that takes into account your budget and my needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
