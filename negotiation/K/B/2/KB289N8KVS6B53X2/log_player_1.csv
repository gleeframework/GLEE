Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice will accept no less than $1,500,000 for the product because she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at that price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. He'll only accept an offer equal to or less than this amount.
* **The Negotiation Gap:**  There's a potential negotiation gap.  While Bob won't pay above $1,000,000, Alice has no incentive to go below $1,500,000.

**Optimal Strategy**

Since there's no price point where both Alice and Bob benefit, Alice's best move is to offer the product slightly above Bob's valuation. This gives the appearance of a potential deal while ensuring Alice can still sell to John.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a competitive price for such a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Why this Approach Works**

* **Creates a Sense of Urgency:** The message implies the product is in high demand.
* **Justifies the Price:**  Highlighting the ""unique value"" aims to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Leaves Room for Counteroffer:** While unlikely, Bob might counter, potentially giving Alice a chance to negotiate slightly down but still above her bottom line.

**Important Note:** It's highly probable Bob will reject this offer. However, it's the best strategic move for Alice to maximize her potential earnings."
