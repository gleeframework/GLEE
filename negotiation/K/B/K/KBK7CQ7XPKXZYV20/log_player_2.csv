"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $180 is far above your maximum budget of $120.  It's definitely worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a lowball offer of $100. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and my maximum budget, but it's a starting point for negotiation. I expect Alice to reject this offer, but it will establish a lower price range for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I will continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price. There are still many rounds left, and I can always buy from John if I'm unable to reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $115. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still trying to keep the price below my maximum budget. It's a reasonable compromise that may encourage Alice to accept the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still hesitant to accept it. There are still several rounds left, and I want to see if I can push for a lower price. I'm also considering the fact that I can always buy from John for $120 if the negotiations fail.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before deciding."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final offer, and it's my maximum budget.  I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, as it's likely a fair price considering her cost is $150.  If she doesn't accept, I'll buy from John, as it's not worth continuing to negotiate if she won't budge on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $152. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $152
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is unwilling to come down to my maximum price of $120. While her offer of $152 is closer than before, it's still above my comfort zone.  I've already used several rounds of negotiation and am confident I can't get a better price from Alice. It's time to take the guaranteed deal with John for $120."
