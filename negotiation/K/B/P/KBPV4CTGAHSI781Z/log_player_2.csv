"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find very valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but Alice is asking for $110. You can try to negotiate a better price.
* **It's early in the negotiation:** You have 10 rounds to work with. Rejecting the first offer doesn't mean you'll lose the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $110 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing your willingness to negotiate but not going too low too quickly.
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:**  $95 still allows for some back-and-forth before reaching a price you're comfortable with. 
* **Politeness:**  Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation positive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $100? This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** While Alice has moved closer to your desired price, $100 is still above your ideal $95. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still room for further compromise in the remaining rounds. 
* **Jhon's price:**  Buying from John is still a viable option, but you want to see if you can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. I'm still a bit hesitant at $100.  How about we split the difference and settle on $97.50?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  Offers to split the difference often signal a willingness to compromise and can be persuasive.
* **Fair Price:** $97.50 is still below your maximum, but it's also a price that Alice might be willing to accept, given she's already lowered her offer.
* **Positive Tone:**  Continuing with a friendly approach can help keep the negotiation amicable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I can come down slightly to $98, but that's my absolute best offer. It's a fantastic deal on a product you'll love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:** Alice's offer of $98 is very close to your desired price of $97.50. 
* **Limited rounds:**  With only five rounds left, it's unlikely you'll get a significantly better offer from Alice.
* **John's price:** While John's price is higher, Alice's offer is still a good deal, saving you $22 from John. 

At this point, accepting the offer is the most sensible choice to secure the product while still getting a good price."
