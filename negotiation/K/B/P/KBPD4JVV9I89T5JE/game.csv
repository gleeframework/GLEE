"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference at $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll still get great value for the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to make a profit, but $105 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet at $98? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",98.0,Bob,4,
