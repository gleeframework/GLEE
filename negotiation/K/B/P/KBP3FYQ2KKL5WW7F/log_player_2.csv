"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
