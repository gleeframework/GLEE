"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
