"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. After re-evaluating the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
