"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for a product worth a lot more to me! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $13,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, though.  How about $13,500? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject the offer.  He's still willing to pay less, and Alice has shown flexibility. There's still room to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $13,500 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $13,250?  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $13,250 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. How about $13,375? This is my final offer, I'm ready to close the deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob should accept the offer.  Alice has clearly stated this is her final offer, and while it's still slightly above his target, he's only $1,375 over his maximum.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely.  It's more advantageous to accept and secure the product, even with a small overage."
