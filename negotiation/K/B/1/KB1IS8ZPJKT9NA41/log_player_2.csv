"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $7500. I believe this is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save even more money by negotiating with Alice. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less.  Would you be willing to consider $7,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to move forward if you're open to it."", ""product_price"": 7000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $7250. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $7,500 to $7,250. This is a good compromise, as it's still a better price than what John is offering.  Bob can save $750 by accepting Alice's offer. There's a chance he could negotiate a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal to John is too high."
