"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $150 to you and I'm happy with that price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by counteroffering. There's room for negotiation since Alice is happy to sell at $140, which means she'd likely accept a price slightly lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. This still gives you a good profit and is a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $135? That's still a good profit for me, and closer to your offer. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, and $135 is a good deal for Bob.  It's still lower than John's price, and Alice is likely willing to accept this offer.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the opportunity to buy from Alice."
