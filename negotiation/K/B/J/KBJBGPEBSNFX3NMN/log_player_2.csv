Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $975,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000, Bob. I think you're getting a great deal at that price, considering the product's value is worth at least $1,200,000 to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'll meet you at $950,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still more than you're willing to pay. It's time to move on and secure the product from John for $800,000. While you're leaving some profit on the table with John, you're staying within your budget and avoiding further negotiation."
