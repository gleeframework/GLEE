"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are looking to pay no more than $10,000, and her initial offer is $9,500. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, and Alice is likely willing to lower her price to secure a sale. 
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** It's good to keep in mind, but you'll save money by negotiating with Alice if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting lower:**  My offer is $500 lower than Alice's, which shows I'm serious about negotiating. 
* **Reasonable offer:**  $9,000 is still within my budget and leaves room for Alice to make a profit, making it a reasonable counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** I keep the tone polite and express appreciation for her willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit lower than I'd like to go. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is coming down:**  She's dropped her price from $9,500 to $9,250, which is a good sign. 
* **Still too high:**  $9,250 is still above my target of $10,000 maximum.
* **More room to negotiate:** There's still room for a deal at a price closer to my target.  I'm going to counter again and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you're being flexible. $9,250 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but polite:** I'm reiterating my previous offer, showing I'm serious but keeping the tone respectful.
* **Focus on common ground:** I emphasize finding a price that benefits both of us, reminding Alice that a deal is better than no deal. 
* **No concessions yet:** I'm not budging on my price yet, but I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation."
