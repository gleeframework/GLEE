"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $12,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $12,000.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,000. I think this is a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to you is $12,000.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still finding it hard to justify $13,500.  How about we settle right at $12,000? That's my final offer, as I know I can get it for that elsewhere, but I'd rather work with you.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $12,000. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,500 and $12,000. I'm offering the product to you for $13,250. This is my final offer.",13250.0,Alice,7,
