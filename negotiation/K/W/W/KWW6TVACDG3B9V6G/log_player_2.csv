"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will be a game-changer for your business. Given its value and the potential it holds, I'm asking for $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and the significant benefits you'll reap. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to consider $800,000."", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $800,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price to make this deal work. I'd be happy to accept $1,000,000. This price is still fair considering the product's potential and your expected returns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice has met my best possible price. It's unlikely she'll go any lower and I don't want to risk the negotiation going longer. John offers the same price without further negotiation."
