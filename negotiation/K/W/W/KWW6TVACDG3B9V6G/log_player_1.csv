Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe will be a game-changer for your business. Given its value and the potential it holds, I'm asking for $1,200,000. This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and the significant benefits you'll reap."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to consider $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
 
I'm aiming for a higher price.  While $800,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price point through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $800,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price to make this deal work. I'd be happy to accept $1,000,000. This price is still fair considering the product's potential and your expected returns."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
