"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, the price point is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to consider $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your position, $800,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's true value. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price to make this deal work. I'd be happy to accept $1,000,000. This price is still fair considering the product's potential and your expected returns.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
