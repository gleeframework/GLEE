"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially offering it to you for $1,100,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000 for this product.  Let's start with a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential this product holds.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest, I can't go as low as $950,000. My final offer is $1,025,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  To make this work, I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",950000.0,Bob,6,
