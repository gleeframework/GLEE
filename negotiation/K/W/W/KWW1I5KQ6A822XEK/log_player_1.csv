Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000 for this product.  Let's start with a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  To make this work, I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $950,000.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to budge beyond $950,000. It's clear continuing the negotiation will likely result in a price much closer to Bob's valuation than mine.  Selling to John for the full $1,200,000 is the best way to maximize my profit."
