"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm initially offering it to you for $1,100,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, and she's offering it for $1,100,000.  This indicates there's room for negotiation, and Bob should try to get a better deal.  

The goal is to save as much money as possible. Going to the next round allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get the price down closer to his $800,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000 for this product.  Let's start with a counteroffer of $900,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** Bob's initial counteroffer is aggressive, starting at $900,000. This shows Alice that he's serious about getting a good deal and is willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, focusing on Bob's budget and the need for a mutually agreeable price.
* **Openness:**  The message ends on a positive note, signaling Bob's willingness to continue negotiating."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential this product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down slightly, but her offer is still above Bob's target price of $800,000. Bob should reject the offer and continue negotiating. There's still room for Alice to come down further.  It's important for Bob to be patient and try to get the best possible deal, especially with the option of buying from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Incremental Increase:** Bob raises his offer by $50,000, showing he's willing to compromise but is still pushing for a better price.
* **Fair Compromise:** He emphasizes that his offer is a ""fair compromise,"" positioning it as a reasonable solution that benefits both parties.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message concludes with confidence, expressing belief in reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest, I can't go as low as $950,000. My final offer is $1,025,000. This is a firm offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,025,000, which is still above Bob's target price.  However, the fact that she called this her ""final offer"" could be a signal that there's not much room for further negotiation.  Bob should still reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. 

* **Reasoning:** Alice has demonstrated a willingness to compromise, but Bob is still holding out for a better deal.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and could potentially push Alice closer to Bob's target price. 
* **Considerations:**
    * If Bob accepts the offer, he'll be paying $225,000 more than his target price.
    * Rejecting the offer gives Bob another round to try and get closer to his goal.
    *  While the risk of Alice walking away increases, there's still a possibility of a better outcome."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  To make this work, I'm going to have to stick with my previous offer of $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm but Fair:** Bob is sticking with his previous offer, showing he's serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Appeal to Compromise:** He emphasizes that his offer is a ""fair compromise"" and reminds Alice that they're close to a deal.
* **Urgency:** The message suggests a sense of urgency, implying that the deal could fall through if they don't come to an agreement soon. This could nudge Alice to consider his offer more seriously."
