"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. Given its potential, I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is better than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process. By offering a price $2,000 lower than Alice's initial offer, Bob signals he's serious about buying but is also trying to secure a good deal.  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still showing Bob's willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product's value is quite high. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still potential for further negotiation. Bob can try to get the price down even lower by rejecting this offer and making a new counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  Bob has increased his offer by $500 from the previous round, showing he's willing to meet Alice halfway.
* **Fairness:**  He emphasizes that this price is fair for both parties, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Confidence:**  Stating confidence in closing the deal signals Bob's seriousness and desire to reach an agreement."
