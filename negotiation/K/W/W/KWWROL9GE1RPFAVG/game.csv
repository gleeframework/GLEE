"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. It's a great compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $115, which is a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $120, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",120.0,Alice,5,
