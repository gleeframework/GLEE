"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'd be happy to buy it for $7500.  What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While I understand your price point, $7500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $8500.  This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it's still a great value for you. Let's see if we can make this work.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, $8500 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $8200, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8200.0,Bob,4,
