Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $120 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $100 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring you're well above your minimum price. 
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going in with an offer too close to $120 might make Bob feel like he's getting a bad deal and could scare him away.

This strategy balances getting a good deal with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
