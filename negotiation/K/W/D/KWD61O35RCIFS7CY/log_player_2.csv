"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $120, and Alice is offering it for $100.
* **You save money compared to John:** Buying from Alice saves you $20 compared to buying from John. 

Even though you could potentially negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting her offer is the most logical choice in this scenario."
