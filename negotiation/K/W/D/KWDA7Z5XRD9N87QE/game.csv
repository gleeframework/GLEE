"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $70?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $70 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $82.50?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle for $75? That's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite there yet with $75. How about we meet at $85? That's a bit closer to my minimum price, and I think it's still a fair deal for you.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $78 if that works for you.  Otherwise, I may need to explore other options.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $82, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't agree on a price, I'll have to consider other options.",82.0,Alice,7,
