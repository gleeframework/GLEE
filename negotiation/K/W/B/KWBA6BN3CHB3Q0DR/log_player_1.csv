Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a significant discount to Bob:**  $1,400,000 is less than Bob's perceived value of $1,500,000, making the offer attractive.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  It doesn't undercut my minimum value of $1,200,000, allowing for potential counteroffers and a final price somewhere in the middle. 
* **Provides a strong baseline:** If Bob rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or move on to John."
