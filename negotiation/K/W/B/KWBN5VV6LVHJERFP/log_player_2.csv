"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $9,500.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $9,500
* **Your value:** $10,000
* **John's price:** $10,000

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $500 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll budge, and you risk losing the deal entirely."
