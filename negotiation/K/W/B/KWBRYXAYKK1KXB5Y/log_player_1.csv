"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me, hoping to maximize my profit.  I believe Bob is likely to negotiate, but this will give me room to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm offering $85, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I believe this shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $75 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm offering $82, which is only $2 away from my minimum. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. If he doesn't, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm concerned that we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  I don't want to risk losing a sale completely, so I'm going to sell to John for $80."
