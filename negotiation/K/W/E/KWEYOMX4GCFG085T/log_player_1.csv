"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but still leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping to capture a good portion of the value Bob sees in the product while leaving him some room to feel like he got a good deal.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price of $100. I'll counter with a price that's still above my minimum, but hopefully closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  I'm willing to come down to $90, but that's my final offer. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway.  $90 is still a decent profit for me, and hopefully, it's an attractive price for him too.  I'm putting the pressure on him to make a decision. If he doesn't accept, I'll have to consider selling to John, but I'm hoping we can close this deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $80 is the most I'm willing to pay. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I've reached my minimum price for the product, and while I'd love to get more, Bob is firm at $80. It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for the same price. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and move on."
