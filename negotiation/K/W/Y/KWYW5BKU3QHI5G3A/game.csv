"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident you'll see the value in this product and be willing to pay a premium for it.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on the value of this product. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to move up to $750,000 to try and close this deal.  It's a fair offer, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not giving it away. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in making a decision now.",825000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to offer $775,000 to try and get this done. Let me know if that works for you.",775000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go much lower, Bob. I'm going to make one final offer. I can sell it to you for $825,000, which is the same price I offered in Round 7. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,9,
