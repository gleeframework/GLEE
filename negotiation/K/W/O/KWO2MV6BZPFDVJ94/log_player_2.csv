Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you've stretched your budget to $675,000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll counter with $700,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?

It's getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While you might be able to get it a bit lower in the final round, it's unlikely to be a significant difference. Accepting at $700,000 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of losing the product entirely."
