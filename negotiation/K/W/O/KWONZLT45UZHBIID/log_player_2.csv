"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product! We're excited to discuss the details with you. We're willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. We believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and we're confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,300,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is my best offer, and I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is our best counteroffer, and we hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly Bob's maximum budget. Accepting this offer allows Bob to buy the product without exceeding his budget. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting a counteroffer and potentially losing the deal to John is too high."
