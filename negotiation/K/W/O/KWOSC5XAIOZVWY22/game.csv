"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe the product is a good fit for me, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, $900000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $950000?  This would allow me to proceed with the sale and still ensure a fair return on my investment.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $950000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $920000. Can we meet at this price?",920000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to make a final concession and come down to $930000.  This price reflects the significant value the product brings to you, while also allowing me to make a fair return on my investment.  I believe this is a win-win situation. Let me know if this works for you.",930000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $930000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920000 and $930000, which would be $925000. Can we do that?",925000.0,Bob,6,
