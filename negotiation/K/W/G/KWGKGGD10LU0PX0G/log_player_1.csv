{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also being friendly and confident, which might encourage Bob to negotiate.  If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter and adjust the price based on his response.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $11,000. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter his offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,250?  I'm confident you'll find this product is worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 10250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $10,250. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. I think that's a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's likely that further negotiations will only take longer and might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale."
