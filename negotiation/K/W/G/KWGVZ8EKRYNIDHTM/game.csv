"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $500,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $900,000? This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's closer to your initial budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your flexibility.  To be honest, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $700,000?  That would work much better for my budget.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
