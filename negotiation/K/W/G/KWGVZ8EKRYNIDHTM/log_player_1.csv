{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($800,000), but lower than my minimum value ($1,500,000). 
* This initial offer gives me room to negotiate, and it might entice Bob to consider the deal.
* The message is friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer. 
* This strategy is aimed at securing a good deal while also keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $500,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. 
* Accepting his offer would result in a huge loss for me.
* I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round. 
* I still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $500,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $900,000? This price still allows me to make a profit, and it's closer to your initial budget. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$900,000** is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* The message is positive and emphasizes finding a mutually beneficial solution, fostering a collaborative tone.
* This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while still securing a profit close to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. I appreciate your flexibility.  To be honest, $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $700,000?  That would work much better for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $700,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,500,000. 
* While I'm willing to negotiate, accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss for me.
* I will reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round. 
* I still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$850,000** is a compromise that is significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer. It shows that I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go much lower. 
* The message is direct and emphasizes the need to find a mutually beneficial solution. I'm also highlighting the fact that this offer is my final concession.
* This counteroffer aims to close the deal at a price that is closer to my minimum value and still within a reasonable range for Bob."
