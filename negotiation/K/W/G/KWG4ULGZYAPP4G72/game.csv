"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product could be valuable, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that takes into account your concerns while still recognizing the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be totally transparent, I have another offer on the table for $1,000,000. If you're able to come down to that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for the offer, Bob. I understand you have another option on the table, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. I believe the product is still worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal. If not, I'll consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
