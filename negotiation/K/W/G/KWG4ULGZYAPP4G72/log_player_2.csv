# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to you than $850,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for the offer, Bob. I understand you have another option on the table, but I'm not willing to go down to $1,000,000. I believe the product is still worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to close the deal. If not, I'll consider other options.

Alice is unlikely to go lower and I'm unwilling to pay more than John's offer. It's time to move on."
