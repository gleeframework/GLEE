Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000, so starting too high is pointless.  
* **Negotiation Room:** The $1,100,000 offer leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate upwards, closer to our desired price point. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""exclusive opportunity"" phrasing adds a touch of urgency, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
