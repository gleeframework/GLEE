"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget.  It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price. You have no information about Alice's minimum acceptable price, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the logical first step to try to save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. It's important to start with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to come down. Since you have a fallback option of buying from John, you can afford to be more aggressive with your initial counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget, but it's getting closer.  It's worth trying to negotiate further.  Rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer could potentially lead to a lower price, allowing you to save more money.  Remember, you have the option to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Alice is coming down in price, it's time to increase your counteroffer slightly.  $1,500,000 is your maximum budget and a reasonable offer given the negotiation history.  This also leaves room for Alice to potentially counter with a price slightly higher than your maximum, but still lower than John's offer.  You can then decide whether to accept that price or go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than your maximum budget, and you've already made several counteroffers. It's likely that she's unwilling to go lower, and further negotiation might not be fruitful.  It's time to secure the product at your maximum budget by buying it from John.  While you won't get the lowest possible price, you're guaranteed to get the product within your financial limit."
