I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150?,150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"That's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but $85 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $120?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $100?  That's a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $115?",115.0,Alice,5,
