It's always worth trying to negotiate, especially since you have a backup option.  You can likely get a better deal than $1,200,000."

I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping to find a price that is closer to my target of saving as much money as possible."

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still a bit high.  I'm going to try another counteroffer to see if we can get closer to a mutually agreeable price."

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still below Alice's last offer.  I'm hoping this shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price. While I'd still prefer a lower price,  $1,075,000 is a good deal compared to buying from John.  It's worth accepting this offer and saving $425,000."
