"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. I believe it's a valuable asset that could be a great addition to your business. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm opening the negotiation with a price significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down while still aiming for a high profit.
* **Positive message:**  The message is friendly and highlights potential benefits for Bob, hoping to pique his interest and encourage him to consider my offer. 
* **Leaving space for counteroffers:**  I don't want to scare Bob off by starting too high. By leaving space for counteroffers, I can potentially find a middle ground that satisfies both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm only able to offer $1800000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my target price. While I need to consider his willingness to negotiate, selling for $1,800,000 would still be a good deal for me. However, there are still rounds remaining, and I believe I can push for a higher price. By rejecting his offer, I maintain my negotiating leverage and signal that I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to $1,900,000. This product is truly valuable, and I believe its worth to you justifies a slightly higher price. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm moving my price down from $2,000,000 to $1,900,000, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Reinforcing value:** I reiterate the product's value to emphasize that this price is still fair, hoping to justify my stance and encourage Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Open to further discussion:**  I use language like ""let's find a compromise"" to keep the negotiation open and avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. I'm willing to consider $1850000 as a compromise. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not willing to settle. I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, considering I still have several rounds left and the risk of selling to John for a significantly lower price.  By rejecting his offer, I'm demonstrating my commitment to getting a better deal, while also leaving the door open for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm closer to $1,875,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I think it reflects the true value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1875000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Incremental adjustment:** I'm increasing my offer by a smaller margin ($25,000) to show Bob that I'm getting closer to his price point. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I use phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""true value"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason and to justify my price. 
* **Direct question:** I end with a direct question to encourage Bob to respond and make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your effort, Alice. I would like to counter with $1860000. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,860,000 is very close to my target, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. We're in the middle of the negotiation process, and there are still a few rounds remaining.  I believe I can push for a slightly higher price, especially since selling to John for $1,500,000 is still a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you at $1,865,000. It's a small adjustment from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's seal the deal!"", ""product_price"": 1865000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small Adjustment:** I'm only increasing my offer by $5,000 to show Bob that I'm almost ready to accept his price but still pushing for a slightly higher figure.
* **Emphasis on Closing:**  I'm using positive language like ""seal the deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept my final offer.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** While I'm getting close to Bob's offer, I'm still keeping some leverage by not completely accepting his price. This prevents me from settling too low, but it also demonstrates my flexibility and willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $1862500. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,862,500 is very close to my previous counteroffer, and we're almost at the end of the negotiation process. While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk of him rejecting my offer again, leaving me with only one round remaining.

Considering the potential of reaching a stalemate and the possibility of having to sell to John for $1,500,000, I believe accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy. This secures a favorable deal for me, maximizing my profit within the limited time frame."
