{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate the offer, $18,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $12,000.  This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both place on this product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to make a significant step, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $12,000, which is $13,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is getting closer to my target, it's still higher than my budget. I'm willing to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice.  Let's split the difference one more time.  I'm willing to offer $12,500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to meet you at $12,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll sell the product to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $13,500 is still above my budget, and I've already made multiple counteroffers. With only a few rounds left, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that we'll reach an agreement.  To ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll buy it from John for $10,000."
