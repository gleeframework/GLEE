"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a great deal, considering its true value is much higher. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I've seen it for elsewhere. Can you meet me at that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm looking for a better deal. Can you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $110. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but I'm still a bit away from being comfortable with $110. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,6,
