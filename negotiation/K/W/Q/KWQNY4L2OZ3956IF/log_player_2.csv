"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. I have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider selling it for $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation. This leaves me space to increase my offer if needed while staying well below my $12,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved closer to my desired price, I believe there's still room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

I'm proposing a price that splits the difference between her current offer and my previous one. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable outcome."
