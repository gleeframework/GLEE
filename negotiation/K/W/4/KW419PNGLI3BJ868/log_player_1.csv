{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Reasonable Offer:**  $1,100,000 is a reasonable starting point that shows I'm willing to negotiate but still allows for a significant profit for me.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and open to dialogue to encourage Bob to negotiate. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'm prepared to adjust based on Bob's response and potentially counter-offer. If Bob is unwilling to negotiate, I can always fall back on John's offer for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $950,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's room for negotiation. Bob has shown interest in the product and is willing to compromise, indicating a potential for a higher price. 
* **John's Offer as Safety Net:**  I have John's offer as a backup, ensuring I can secure a profitable sale if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Step:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is closer to my desired price point, but still allows for some negotiation. This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the deal alive."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $950,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,025,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm proposing a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's offer ($950,000). This shows willingness to compromise and meet him halfway.
* **Attractive Offer for Bob:** $1,025,000 is still a good price for Bob, as it's lower than his perceived value of $1,000,000.
* **Fair Profit for Me:** This price allows me to make a decent profit while still engaging in a productive negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message maintains a friendly and open tone to encourage Bob to accept the offer.

**Next Steps:**  I'll assess Bob's response and be prepared to negotiate further if needed. However, I'm confident that $1,025,000 is a fair price that is likely to be acceptable to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'd like to try to find a middle ground. How about $980,000? That's a bit closer to my original offer, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Still Possible:**  Bob's offer shows he's willing to compromise further, indicating that there's still room for negotiation.  
* **John's Offer as a Backup:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 if I can't reach a satisfactory price with Bob.

**Next Step:** I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point, but still acknowledges Bob's willingness to negotiate. This strategy allows me to continue the negotiation process with a chance of achieving a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $980,000 is closer to my target price, I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000? This price reflects the value of the product to you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,025,000) and Bob's offer ($980,000). This shows continued willingness to compromise and find a middle ground.
* **Attractive to Both Parties:** $1,000,000 aligns with Bob's perceived value, making it a good deal for him. It also allows me to secure a significant profit while still negotiating with Bob.
* **Final Compromise:** This offer positions me to potentially finalize the deal with Bob. If he accepts, I'll secure a good price. If he rejects, I can still fall back on John's offer. 
* **Positive and Encouraging:** The message remains positive and encourages Bob to consider the finality of the offer, aiming for a successful conclusion to the negotiation."
