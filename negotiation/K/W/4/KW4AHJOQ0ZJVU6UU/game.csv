"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product for $105. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $95. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",95.0,Bob,4,
