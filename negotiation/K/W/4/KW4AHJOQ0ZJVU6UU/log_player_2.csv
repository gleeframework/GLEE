{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above your maximum price of $100.  While there are more rounds, it's likely the negotiations will be protracted and you might not be able to secure a lower price.  John's offer is a guaranteed price of $100, which is within your budget and eliminates the risk of further negotiations."
