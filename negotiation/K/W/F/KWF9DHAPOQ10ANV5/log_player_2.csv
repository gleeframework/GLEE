"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far too high for Bob's budget.  There's no reason to accept it. It's better to try and negotiate with Alice or explore the alternative option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible deal. Since Alice's initial offer was $20,000, Bob is offering a price significantly lower than that.  $8,000 is still a substantial amount, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to come down on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $20,000, it's still above Bob's budget of $10,000. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a lower price. There's still room for further bargaining, and going to John right now would mean paying more than Bob is willing to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to close the gap with Alice, but he's still sticking to his budget. Offering $11,000 is a significant increase from his previous offer, showing Alice he's willing to negotiate, but it's still under her latest offer of $17,000.  This shows a willingness to meet halfway, but it also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, but it's getting closer.  There are still rounds left, so Bob should continue negotiating.  He may be able to get closer to his target price of $10,000. Buying from John at this point would mean paying more than what Alice is currently offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, but he's still sticking to a price that's within his budget. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about buying the product but also that he's not willing to overpay. It's a good compromise that could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
