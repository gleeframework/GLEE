"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the ""unique potential"" of the product, aiming to justify the high initial price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price at any time. This knowledge empowers my negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter in the next round. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a tempting backup plan, but I'll aim to secure a better deal with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While your offer is quite a bit below what I had in mind, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This offer still reflects the true value and potential of this product."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a significant drop from my initial offer to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. However, I'm still well above both his offer and my absolute minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the high price point and potentially shift Bob's perception of its worth.
* **Balancing Risk:**  I'm aware of the remaining rounds and the John option. This offer represents a calculated risk, aiming for a high price while leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still out of my range. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's work together to reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. While selling to John is an option, securing even $100,000 more from Bob would be a significant win. I'm willing to continue negotiating for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this reflects a fair price considering the long-term value and potential this product holds. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Approach:**  I'm making smaller concessions now ($200,000 reduction) to signal that I'm reaching a more firm stance.
* **Future Focus:**  I'm emphasizing the ""long-term value"" to nudge Bob away from focusing solely on his immediate budget and consider the bigger picture.
* **Pressure Tactic:**  By directly asking ""What do you say?"", I'm subtly increasing the pressure for Bob to respond more decisively.
* **Alternative in Mind:** I'm still open to John's offer if Bob doesn't meet my price expectations in the upcoming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above my absolute minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more in further negotiations, the gains might be small and risk losing the deal altogether. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now provides immediate value and avoids the uncertainty of continued back-and-forth.

Bob's offer represents a strong outcome, exceeding my minimum threshold. Accepting now secures a profitable deal and allows me to move on to other opportunities."
