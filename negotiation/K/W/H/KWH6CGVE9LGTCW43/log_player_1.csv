Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $1,275,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Bob's offer of $1,275,000 is a reasonable compromise.  While I could try to push for more, there's a risk he'll walk away, and John's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant drop. It's better to secure a solid deal now."
