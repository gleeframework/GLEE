"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am not able to meet the price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1500000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1750000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds. Let's find common ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the discount, I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my initial proposal. I would like to counteroffer at $1600000. I hope this suggestion is within your consideration.",1600000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  While $1600000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go down to $1650000.  This is a significant investment for you, but the potential benefits this product offers are equally significant. Let's close this deal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
