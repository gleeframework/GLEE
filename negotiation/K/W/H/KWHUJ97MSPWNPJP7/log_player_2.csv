```

**Explanation:**

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is making a final push towards his target price.  He's increasing his offer slightly to demonstrate his willingness to compromise, but he's still aiming for a significant discount. This offer is a good compromise: it's lower than Alice's last offer, but still higher than his previous counteroffer, which is likely to be more appealing to Alice. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob is likely to accept her next counteroffer, or he might be willing to go with John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only one round left, Bob needs to decide if he wants to risk another counteroffer and potentially lose the deal. While Alice's offer of $10,500 is still higher than Bob's desired price, it's a significant saving compared to buying from John. The risk of another counteroffer might result in Alice asking for a higher price or rejecting Bob's offer entirely, forcing him to buy from John at the higher price. Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a price that is still within his budget and significantly lower than the alternative."
