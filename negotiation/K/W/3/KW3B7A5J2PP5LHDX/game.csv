"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe the product is valuable, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,150,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit away from my desired price. Let's bridge the gap a little more.  I'm willing to come down to $1,180,000. This reflects the significant value this product offers, while also acknowledging your financial considerations. What do you think?",1180000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $1,180,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,160,000. Can we meet in the middle at this price?",1160000.0,Bob,4,
