"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is significantly lower than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. It's a great deal for Bob, and there's no reason to risk losing the product by negotiating further or buying from John at a higher price."
