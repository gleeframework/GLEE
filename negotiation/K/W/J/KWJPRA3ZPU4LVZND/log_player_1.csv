Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $12,000, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and potentially start a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $15,000 is better than my minimum value of $12,000, I believe I can still get a higher price. I'm going to make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
``` 

I'm offering $16,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  $14,500 is a good deal considering my minimum value and the risk of further negotiation.  There's a chance Bob might reject my counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price."
