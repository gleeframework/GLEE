"Bob, I'm confident this product is a valuable asset for you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its potential.  My asking price is $1400000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it leaves room for negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000.  This gives you a significant discount while still allowing me to get a fair return on my investment.  What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to negotiate a good price, and I respect that.  However, $1250000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle again. How about $1275000? It's a small increase from your last offer, but it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1275000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $1260000, but that's as high as I can go. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product for both of us.",1260000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I'm still not able to go below $1265000.  This would be a fair price that recognizes the value of the product for both of us, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can close this deal.  What are your thoughts?",1265000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1265000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1240000, and that's my final offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on this price.",1240000.0,Bob,8,
