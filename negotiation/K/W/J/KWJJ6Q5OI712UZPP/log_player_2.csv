"Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $800,000 to him, he's willing to pay that much, but no more.  Alice's offer of $800,000 is the maximum he's willing to pay, and he's not getting any savings.  Therefore, he should reject the offer and buy from John, as John's offer is also $800,000, but Bob still has the option to negotiate with John in the future."
