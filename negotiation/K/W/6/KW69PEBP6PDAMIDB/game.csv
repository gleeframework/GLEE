,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm.  However, $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $115 for the product.  What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $130 might be a bit steep, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120, which is the absolute most I can afford right now. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell it to you for less than $125. I'm willing to make a slight concession and offer it to you for $124.50. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",124.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still not quite there at $124.50.  How about we split the difference and I offer you $122. That would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I can close this deal with you today.",122.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $125. I'm willing to make another small concession and offer it to you for $123.50. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",123.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you sticking with this negotiation. While I understand your position, $123.50 is still a bit too high for me.  If you're truly willing to make a deal today, I'm willing to offer you $122.50 for the product.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it'll get us both to a close.",122.5,Bob,8,
