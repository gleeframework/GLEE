"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14000. It's a great deal, and I think it would be a valuable asset to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Since Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price, it makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price.  There's potential to get a better deal from Alice, or at least get closer to Bob's ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $13000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget and closer to his ideal price than John's offer of $15,000. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save money and acquire the product.  While there might be a chance to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
