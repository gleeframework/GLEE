This strategy aims to secure a price close to the maximum while keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $14000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but I'm not ready to settle just yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering a price of $13,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** The message acknowledges Bob's offer while emphasizing the value of the product. It also suggests a sense of fairness and encourages further negotiation. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties while maintaining my position as the seller with the higher price advantage."
