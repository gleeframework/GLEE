"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident this is a fair price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than $10,000, I can still do better.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $14,000. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still allow you a good profit margin, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in between. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $11,500 is still a bit low. I'll counter again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure as the rounds are ticking by. I need to find a compromise soon or I might have to settle for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm feeling the pressure to close this deal, but I can't go any lower than $12,500. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer, and it's the absolute lowest I can go. Let's finalize this and make it a win-win. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,250. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,250 is very close to my desired price point.  While I'd love to get even more, it's getting late in the game.  If I reject this offer, I risk running out of time and having to settle for John's offer of $10,000.  It's time to take the deal and secure a profit."
