It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $13,000 is still too high, and there's a chance you can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering $9,000, which is still significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but closer to my budget.  It's a good starting point for negotiation."

$11,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'll try another counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm increasing my offer to $10,000, hoping it's closer to a meeting point. Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so I'm trying to find a price that's acceptable to both of us."

I'm still hesitant to pay more than $10,000.  I'll make another counteroffer.  If Alice rejects it, I'll consider buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10250}

I'm increasing my offer to $10,250, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest one.  I'm hoping this shows I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm still not willing to go much higher."

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, and we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds.  I'm willing to accept $10,350 to avoid further negotiations and possibly losing the product."
