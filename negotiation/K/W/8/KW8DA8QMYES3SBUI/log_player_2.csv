"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. I think this is a great price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is better than $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price is fair considering your value for it and my budget.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my minimum requirement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price.  $8,750 is a good compromise and still significantly lower than the $10,000 Bob would pay John. Accepting the offer saves Bob money and avoids further negotiation."
