"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This price is fair considering your value for it and my budget.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my minimum requirement.",8750.0,Alice,3,
