"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  You can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more. By rejecting, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. You're showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but you're also not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what you can get from John.  You should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's closer to Alice's price, showing you're serious about buying, but still below what she offered, making it a fair deal. You're essentially asking Alice to meet you halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your maximum price, but it's still not worth it. You've already had a few rounds of negotiations and it seems like Alice is unwilling to come down further. Since John is willing to sell for your maximum price, it's best to buy from John and avoid further negotiation."
