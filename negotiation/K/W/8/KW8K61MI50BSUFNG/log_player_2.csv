"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer. You don't know her value for the product, and there's a chance you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price is a good strategy. This shows you are serious about negotiating and forces Alice to consider your offer.  A million dollars is a substantial discount, and it leaves room for negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than what you're aiming for. There's room for further negotiation, and you have more rounds to leverage.  Rejecting her offer keeps the pressure on Alice to reduce the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate, but it's still a significant amount above your target. By increasing your offer slightly from the previous round, you show you're serious about buying the product while still pushing for a better price. This also allows for potential compromise in the next round."
