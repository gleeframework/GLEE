"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate but I'm confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that low, especially so early in the negotiation. I'll counteroffer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm dropping the price slightly from my initial offer but still aiming for a substantial profit. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer, and while it's still not my ideal price, it's getting closer. It's also  becoming riskier to keep negotiating.  I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, Bob will walk away, and I'll be stuck selling to John for my minimum.  $1,100,000 is a good profit and I'm willing to take it at this point."
