"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is still a great deal for you, but also reflects the value that I think this product holds. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $850,000. It's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this out.",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $920,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",880000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going below $930,000. I think this product is worth every penny, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. What do you think?",930000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm starting to get worried we won't be able to find common ground.  I'm willing to go up to $890,000, but that's my final offer.  I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen.",890000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point where it's more worth my while to explore other options. I'm willing to meet you at $900,000, but I'm not going any higher. This is my final offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $890,000.  We've come so far in this negotiation, and I truly believe we can find a final price that works for both of us.  This is my absolute final offer:  $895,000.  If this isn't acceptable, I will have to explore other options.",895000.0,Bob,10,
