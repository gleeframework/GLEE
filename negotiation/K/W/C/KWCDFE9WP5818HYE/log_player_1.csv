"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $900,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's get this deal done!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a price of $900,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $800,000, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Motivational Message:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to accept the offer.
* **Directness:** I'm clear and concise about my offer. 

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects, I have room to lower my price while still maintaining a profit.  I also have the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I really love the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value.  I have several reasons to reject his offer and continue negotiating:

* **My Target:** I want to earn more than $800,000, and selling to John for $800,000 is my safety net.  Bob's offer isn't enough to meet my goals.
* **Negotiation Power:**  Rejecting Bob's offer demonstrates my willingness to stand firm on my value. It keeps him engaged in the process and allows me to set the pace. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a price closer to my initial offer or at least reach $800,000.  

By rejecting, I maintain control and leverage in the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 simply isn't enough for this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $825,000? This gives you a great deal, and it's a price I can live with."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my minimum price. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit.
* **Emphasize Value:** I reiterate the unique value of the product to reinforce why it's worth a slightly higher price. 
* **Clear Offer:** I'm direct with the counteroffer price, making it easy for Bob to understand the terms. 

This strategy aims to close the gap with Bob while keeping my options open. If he accepts, I make a decent profit. If he rejects, I can still negotiate further or sell to John as a backup plan."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $825,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $775,000. That's the best I can do for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied. 

* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm sticking to my initial goal of earning more than $800,000.  Accepting $775,000 wouldn't meet that objective.
* **Risk-Averse:**  I'm aware that I have a guaranteed $800,000 from John.  There's no need to settle for less.
* **Possible Compromise:**  I believe there's still room for Bob to come up slightly in his offer.  Rejecting gives me the opportunity to push for a deal closer to $800,000.

By rejecting the offer, I retain the advantage and control in the negotiation. It's a calculated risk that might lead to a more favorable outcome for me."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand we're close, but $775,000 still falls short of the value this product brings. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and allows you to secure this exceptional product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting the Middle Ground:** I'm proposing a price that's precisely between my minimum value and Bob's latest offer. This shows willingness to compromise and encourages a quick resolution. 
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I highlight that $800,000 is a fair deal for both of us, making it less about ""giving in"" and more about finding common ground.
* **Closing the Deal:** The message is direct and persuasive, aiming to seal the deal in this round.

This counteroffer puts the pressure on Bob to accept or risk losing the product."
