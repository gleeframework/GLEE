"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you reaching out. I'm interested in the product but $10,000 is a bit high for me at the moment. How about $9,000?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,500? That's still a good price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
