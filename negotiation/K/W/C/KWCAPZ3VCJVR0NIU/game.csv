"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable selling it to you for $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95. This is a good price for both of us, and I think it reflects the value of the product.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $98. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a good price considering the product's value to me.",98.0,Alice,5,
