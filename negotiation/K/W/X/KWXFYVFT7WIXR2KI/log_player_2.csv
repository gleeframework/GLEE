"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I'm excited to share with you, Bob. I'm open to discussing a fair price. My initial offer is $10,000 for the product. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a better price than $12,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's room for both of them to find a price that is beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $9,500 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $9,500 is less than Bob's maximum price of $12,000. 
* **It's a better deal than John's offer:**  This offer is significantly lower than John's price.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it:** While Bob could try to get a lower price, there's a chance Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal with minimal risk."
