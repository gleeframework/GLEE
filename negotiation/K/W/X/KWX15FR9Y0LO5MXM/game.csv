"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me there?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'm willing to pay $13,500. Can you meet me there?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go below $17,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, so how about we meet in the middle at $16,500?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,500. Can you meet me there?",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my costs. How about we meet at $16,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",16000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm willing to pay $14,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Bob,8,
