Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it gives us room for negotiation. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While $125 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my minimum of $150. I'm not willing to accept that. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm offering the product for $150. This is my minimum acceptable price, and it's still a fair price considering Bob's willingness to pay.  I'm hoping he'll see the value and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'd rather have some money than nothing, I'm not willing to risk further negotiations.  John is offering a fair price and I can guarantee the sale."
