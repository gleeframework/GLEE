It's a great deal at $500,000, but it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get an even better price."

I'm offering $350,000.  This is a significant discount from her initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see if she's willing to meet me halfway."

$400,000 is a good price, considering my maximum budget is $1,200,000. It's a significant saving compared to buying from John."
