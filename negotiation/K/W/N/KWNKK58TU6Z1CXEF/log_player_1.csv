``` 

This offer sets the bar high, aiming for a profit while leaving room for negotiation.  The message is friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the value of the product. This strategy allows for potential negotiation without immediately jeopardizing the potential for a higher sale price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $15000, which is fair market value for this product.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I don't want to risk further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
