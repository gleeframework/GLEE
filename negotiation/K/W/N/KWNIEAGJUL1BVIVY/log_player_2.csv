"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12000. This is a great deal for you, as it's worth exactly that amount to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the sale. If not, I'll be selling it to John for the same price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

You're better off buying the product from John for $12,000.  Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price, so there's no potential for saving money. You might as well go with the guaranteed deal from John."
