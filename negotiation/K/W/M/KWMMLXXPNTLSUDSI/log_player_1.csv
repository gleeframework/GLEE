Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's in great condition and worth a lot more than that. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's significantly higher than my minimum of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay closer to his value of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get a higher price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $105 is still a little too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $97.50?  I'm really interested in this product and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $97.50 is a good price and significantly better than selling to John for $80.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk Bob might walk away, and it's likely we'll end up at a similar price point after a few more rounds."
