"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000. This price is a fair reflection of its value, and it gives you a significant opportunity for profit.  I understand you value the product at $1,200,000, so this offer allows you a healthy margin.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise I will be selling to another buyer who has already expressed interest at a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and the price John is offering. By rejecting this offer, you can move forward with purchasing from John at a price that aligns perfectly with your budget."
