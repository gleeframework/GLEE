Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it brings to your business.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on the value I was hoping to get. I can offer you the product for $12,800. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you and my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,800.  You have the option to buy from John for $12,000, guaranteeing you the product at your target price. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation with Alice, as she may not budge, and you'd end up paying more."
