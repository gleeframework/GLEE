"Hello Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm looking to purchase it for a bit less. Would you be willing to come down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $900,000, but I'm afraid I'm not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $1,200,000 is just too high for me.  To move this forward, would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. I think this price reflects the product's value and is a reasonable compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
