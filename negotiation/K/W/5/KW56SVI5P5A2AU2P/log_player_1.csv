{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for your needs. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This leaves room for negotiation and gives you some leverage.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This shows you're willing to compromise and increases the chance Bob will engage in the negotiation. 
* **It's not too aggressive:** A much higher offer could immediately turn Bob off and end the negotiation.

I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer and make a quick sale, I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter-offer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $11,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $12,500? That would give us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
``` 

This counter-offer is still higher than Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum price, showing a willingness to negotiate. It also includes a friendly message to maintain a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,250? That's the lowest I can go 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,250 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, and it's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation and the potential to end up with a lower price or even selling to John for $15,000."
