Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and high demand, I'm asking for $20,000.  I'm confident you'll find this a fair price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my final offer."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While we could continue negotiating with Bob, his offer is unlikely to increase significantly beyond $12,000. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees the best possible outcome at this point, maximizing profit and avoiding further negotiation rounds."
