Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to try to get a better price from Bob.  $120 is a little low, and I think I can do better."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135?  It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a bit more than $120, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $127.50. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $127.50 is a decent price, and it's better than selling to John for $100.  I'm happy to close the deal."
