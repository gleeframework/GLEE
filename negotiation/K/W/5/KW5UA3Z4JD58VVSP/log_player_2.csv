"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $150. I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, and I know I can get the product for $150 from John, it's not wise to accept Alice's offer immediately. I'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $120 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135?  It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to my target, I'm still trying to save money. I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need a bit more than $120, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $127.50. I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 127.5}
