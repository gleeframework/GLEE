"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its value to us, we are offering it to you at an exclusive price of $1350000. This represents a significant saving compared to its full value of $1200000, and we hope this proposal aligns well with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the product's full value, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. While we understand your current budget constraints, we're willing to explore a compromise that benefits both parties. We propose a revised price of $1300000 for the product. This offer still represents a substantial discount compared to its full value, while providing a more favorable price point for you. We hope this proposal is acceptable and look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further.  Bob could offer a price closer to $1,250,000, but a counteroffer of $1,275,000 might be a good compromise."

I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. After careful consideration, we've decided to further refine our offer to better suit your needs while maintaining a fair return for us. We are now proposing a price of $1295000 for the product. This price reflects a balance between the value of the product to us and the budgetary constraints you've shared. We believe this offer presents an attractive opportunity for both parties and hope it meets your requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,295,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price to $1,295,000, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob could continue to negotiate, but at this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $1,200,000.  This saves Bob money and avoids the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer and potentially raising her price again."
