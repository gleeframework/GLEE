"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $130 to start the negotiations. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product.  Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $95?  I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value you'll be getting.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  How about we try $75?  I think that's a fair offer, considering I could get it for $80 elsewhere.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're right that $75 is getting closer, but I need to get a bit more out of this. I can go down to $85, but that's as low as I can go.  What do you say?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position.  How about we split the difference and do $80?  That's my final offer.",80.0,Bob,6,
