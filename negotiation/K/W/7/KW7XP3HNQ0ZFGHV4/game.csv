"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,500. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.",11750.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,750 and $12,500, which is $12,125. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let's finalize the deal!",12125.0,Alice,5,,
