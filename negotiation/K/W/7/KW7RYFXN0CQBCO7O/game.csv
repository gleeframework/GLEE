"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  However, $18000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably afford.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again, and offer $12000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow me to purchase the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $12000, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $13500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
