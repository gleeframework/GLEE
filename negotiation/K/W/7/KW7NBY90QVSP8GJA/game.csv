,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product in your collection. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's fair considering the value we've discussed.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product in your collection. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9000. It's a fair price, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,7,
