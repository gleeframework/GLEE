"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. I think it's a great value, and I'm confident you'll love it.",170.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $170 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $120 for the product. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $145? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet halfway between our last offers - how about $132.50? ",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $132.50. How about we try to find a compromise at $140? It's still a bit above your initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $140 is still more than I can afford.  How about $135? That's a fair compromise, closer to my last offer, and might help us reach a deal.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more compromise at $142.50. It's still a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",142.5,Alice,7,
