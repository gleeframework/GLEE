"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired price. This gives you room to negotiate and appear flexible if you come down in price. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, we know we need to adjust significantly. If he counters, it shows he's interested and willing to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, we have John as a backup who's willing to pay our minimum acceptable price. This gives us leverage. We won't feel pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price. We have room to negotiate. Accepting $10,000 would mean leaving $2,000 on the table compared to selling to John.  Let's see if we can bring Bob closer to our desired range with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you countering, Bob.  I understand the product's value might not be immediately apparent at $16,000. However, $10,000 is significantly less than what I can consider. Could you meet me somewhere in the middle, say, $13,500?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:**  Showing we understand his position helps maintain a positive negotiation environment.
* **Justification:**  We're hinting at the product's value without fully revealing our hand. This might make Bob think it's worth more than he initially thought.
* **Compromise:**  We're moving closer to the middle ground. This signals to Bob that we're willing to negotiate but also holding firm on a price above our minimum. 
* **Targeting Above Minimum:** We're aiming slightly above our $12,000 minimum in case Bob tries to negotiate further down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $11,500, which is only $500 less than our guaranteed sale price to John.  While we could try to push for a bit more, there's a risk Bob might walk away or not budge much further. Accepting this offer guarantees a good profit and avoids the risk of continued negotiation or losing the sale entirely."
