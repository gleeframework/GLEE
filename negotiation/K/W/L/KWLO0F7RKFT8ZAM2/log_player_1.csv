"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is a high starting offer, reflecting the fact that I value the product at $10,000. This will give me room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It's important to start high and gauge Bob's interest before potentially moving to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value. I have more rounds to negotiate, and I believe there's room for improvement.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm countering with $13,500, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise while still remaining above my minimum value.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my preferred price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is getting closer to my minimum value, I still believe there's room for improvement. We're only on round 4, and I'm determined to get a price closer to my initial offer. I'll counter with a slightly higher offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm countering with $13,000, slightly higher than Bob's last offer. This shows that I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go much lower.  I'm hoping this will be a good compromise that Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial offer, we're already in round 6 and Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum value. It's better to secure a sale now than to risk losing him and having to accept John's offer."
