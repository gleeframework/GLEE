"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1000000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $1000000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1400000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1200000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer, considering our previous discussions. I'm offering the product to you for $1300000. This price is closer to your offer, but still reflects the product's value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

This is a small step from my previous offer and a fair compromise. It's getting late in the negotiation and I'm starting to consider my options with John.
