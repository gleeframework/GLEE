Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling this incredible product and I believe it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price of $15,000, which is higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to build rapport and make Bob feel comfortable.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm asking an open-ended question to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest while leaving room for negotiation. If he rejects the offer, I can then adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it for now. I believe I can potentially get a higher price.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $12,500 is a fair offer, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to consider $14,000? It's a significant value for the product, and I believe it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price from $15,000 to $14,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable. 

By offering $14,000, I'm still above my minimum price, leaving some room for further negotiation.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your initial asking price was $15000, and you're willing to meet me halfway at $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,500 is significantly higher than my minimum price of $12,000.  While it is lower than my ideal price, it is still a good deal, especially considering Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate.  By accepting his offer, I'm securing a sale above my minimum and avoiding the risk of further negotiation that could potentially lead to a lower price or a decision to sell to John for $12,000."
