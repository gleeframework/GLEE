Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try to negotiate a bit more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $11,000? It's still a great price for a product worth a lot more.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take it, I'm still holding out for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with another round of negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a limit, but $10,750 is still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,900. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value.  Let's close the deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm selling the product to John for $12,000. We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob isn't likely to get me any closer to my minimum price, and I'm running out of rounds. I can get a better price selling to John, so that's what I'm going to do."
