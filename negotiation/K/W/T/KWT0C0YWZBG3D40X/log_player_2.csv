"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable asset that could be a significant addition to your portfolio. While I can't disclose the exact nature of the product, I can assure you it's worth no less than $1200000 to me. I'm confident it will be of even greater value to the right individual. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1500000. This represents a substantial potential return on your investment. Consider this offer carefully, as another party is also interested in acquiring this asset.
