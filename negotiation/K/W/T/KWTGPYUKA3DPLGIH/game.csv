"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $900000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This price still offers you a significant advantage in the market, and it's a good compromise from my initial offer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
