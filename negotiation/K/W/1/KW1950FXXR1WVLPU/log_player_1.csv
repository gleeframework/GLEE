``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price, but leaves room for negotiation. This strategy gives me a chance to gauge Bob's interest without immediately resorting to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While I'd like to secure a sale, $8,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."

Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, $8,750 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob, or I can always sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
