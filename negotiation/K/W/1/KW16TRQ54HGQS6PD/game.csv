"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that reflects its value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit far off from that number. How about $950,000? That's a substantial offer, and I'm hopeful we can make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
