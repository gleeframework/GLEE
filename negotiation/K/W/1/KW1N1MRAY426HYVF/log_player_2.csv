"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a low counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  Offering $8,000 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for compromise.  This counteroffer allows Bob to see if Alice is willing to meet him halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal.  There are still rounds left, so there is time to try and get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he is willing to compromise. $9,000 is closer to Alice's last offer and still within Bob's budget.  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while keeping in mind his goal of saving money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, but it's still a little higher than Bob's comfort zone. He's not quite ready to accept $11,000.  He's got a few more rounds to try and squeeze out a lower price, and there's always the option of buying from John if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his maximum budget price. This is his final offer, as buying from John at this price would be the same. If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will likely move to buy from John.  This strategy creates urgency for Alice to accept the offer."
