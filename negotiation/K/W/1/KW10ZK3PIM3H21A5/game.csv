"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you consider a price in that range?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, the value of this product is significant and $20,000 is a fair price.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This offer reflects the product's true worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still too high for me.  I can do $9,000, which I believe is a fair offer considering my budget.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $9,000 is still quite a ways from what I'm hoping for.  To be transparent, I have another offer for $15,000, but I'd prefer to find a solution that works for both of us. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for being transparent. While $13,500 is closer, it's still a stretch for me. How about we try $11,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise.",11000.0,Bob,6,
