"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase the product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her value of the product, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price.  We'll counteroffer and see if we can get closer to our target."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than her value of the product ($1,000,000) but it's closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,050,000.  This approach balances the risk of losing the deal with the potential for further savings."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're still a bit away from my target, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,180,000. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has clearly stated this is her lowest possible price.  While I'd prefer a lower price, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether.  At $1,180,000, I'm still saving a significant amount compared to buying from John, and it's within my budget. Accepting this offer is the best course of action."
