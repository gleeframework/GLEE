"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset for a price that's significantly below its true worth. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable addition to your portfolio. However, please note that I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
