"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset for a price that's significantly below its true worth. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be a valuable addition to your portfolio. However, please note that I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","I'm going to reject Alice's offer. I'm looking to save as much money as I can, and buying from Alice for $1,000,000 would leave me with a $200,000 profit margin compared to buying from John for $1,200,000. However, I can do better than that. Since Alice mentioned she has another interested buyer willing to pay $800,000, I'll reject her offer and see if I can get a better deal.
