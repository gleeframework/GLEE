"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable.  My initial price is $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and potential benefits for your business.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it. This price reflects a significant investment on my end and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and recognize your budget constraints. However, $1,250,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still offers you a significant return on investment and represents a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. This would represent a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get closer to your desired price while still giving me a fair price within my budget.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,300,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  Let's split the difference. I'm happy to accept $1,325,000. This ensures we both get a good deal, and we can move forward with this transaction.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,325,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,310,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us to both close this deal without going over my budget. ",1310000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to close this deal.  I'm willing to come down to $1,315,000. This is a fair compromise that gets us both closer to our desired price.  Let's make this happen.",1315000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go up to $1,312,500. This is a very fair compromise, and I believe it's the best we can do within our respective budgets. Let's seal the deal.",1312500.0,Bob,8,
