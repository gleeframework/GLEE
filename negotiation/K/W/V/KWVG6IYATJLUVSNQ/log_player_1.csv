I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price that gives him a good deal while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still make more money by continuing to negotiate. While $85 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $90. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but it's still a good price for both of us.  I believe it's fair and demonstrates a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's only $2 more than what I could get from John, it's still a profit and the negotiation is getting tiring.  I'm happy to move on."
