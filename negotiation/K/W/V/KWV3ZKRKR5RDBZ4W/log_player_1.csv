"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) but well above my minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, aiming to justify the high price and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal even if he negotiates it down slightly.
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping in mind I have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000, I'm not overly attached to this deal if Bob proves too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in Round 3 to try and secure a better price, knowing I always have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,075,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000? This recognizes the product's value while still being a good deal for you."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing a willingness to negotiate by coming down in price. However, the decrease is calculated to keep the deal above the halfway point between our initial offers, aiming for a slight advantage. 
* **Justification:** Framing the counteroffer as ""meeting in the middle"" promotes a sense of fairness and encourages Bob to accept.
* **Alternative Still Available:** I remain aware of John's standing offer, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit higher than $1,110,000. How about we meet at $1,090,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,090,000 is a strong price and represents a significant profit above my minimum. While I could potentially push for a bit more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that our negotiations could stagnate. Accepting this offer secures a great deal and avoids the potential for losing the sale altogether."
