"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $14,000 is above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000. Let me know if you're willing to negotiate.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $9,000. If that's not acceptable, I'm going to have to buy the product elsewhere.",9000.0,Bob,4,
