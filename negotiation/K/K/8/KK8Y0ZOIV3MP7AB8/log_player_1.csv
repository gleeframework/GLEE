Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, attempting to sell to Bob first allows for potential profit beyond that.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a significant profit margin for me while still being an attractive proposition for Bob, as he gains it for $400,000 less than its value to him.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Adding a time constraint encourages Bob to decide quickly and prevents delays that could cost me the guaranteed sale to John."
