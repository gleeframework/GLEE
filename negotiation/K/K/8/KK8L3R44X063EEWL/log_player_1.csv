Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my maximum. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is close, but to be fair to both of us, I need to land at $1,050,000 for this product.  I believe that reflects its significant value while still offering you a competitive price."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $1,000,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

While I could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob arriving at $1,000,000 suggests he's unlikely to go much higher. Accepting his offer secures me the best possible outcome at this point in the negotiation."
