"Bob, I'm excited to offer you something truly extraordinary. This product is incredibly valuable and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a very fair offer.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product. I'm thinking more along the lines of $800,000. Can you meet me halfway?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my maximum. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is close, but to be fair to both of us, I need to land at $1,050,000 for this product.  I believe that reflects its significant value while still offering you a competitive price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000, which would be $1,000,000. Can you consider that?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
