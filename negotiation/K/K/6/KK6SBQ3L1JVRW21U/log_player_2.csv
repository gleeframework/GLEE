"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $8,500.  This is a great deal, as it's worth at least that much to me. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details.  Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's message is bluffing. She's trying to pressure you into accepting a higher price by claiming she has another buyer. You know you can get the product for $8,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more."
