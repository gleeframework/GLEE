"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can potentially save money by negotiating with Alice.  $900,000 is still a significant amount over Alice's value of $800,000.  There's room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering your value for this product is $800,000, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This gives you a nice profit while still being within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still a bit too high.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  There's still room to bargain, and buying from John for $1,000,000 is a last resort if negotiations fail."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $925,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $875,000, which is a fair compromise and allows you a healthy profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 875000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $912,500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $912,500.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $912,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $912,500 is a price that is within Bob's budget and still represents a good deal for Alice. It's a reasonable compromise that avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price. Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there is a risk of Alice walking away or even increasing her price again."
