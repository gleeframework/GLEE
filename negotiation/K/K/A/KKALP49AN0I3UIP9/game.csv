"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $6000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $8500? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from $10000, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $7250? I think that's a fair price for this product.",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7250 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise further,  how about $7800?  This would ensure a fair price for both of us.",7800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $7800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $7400? I think that's a fair price for this product.",7400.0,Bob,6,
