# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
