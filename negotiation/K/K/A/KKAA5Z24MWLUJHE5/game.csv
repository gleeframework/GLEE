"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $9000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal. ",9000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm not willing to go any lower than $10000, Bob. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a free maintenance package, which would normally cost $2000. This way, you'll get an even better deal than my previous offer. I'm still willing to sell the product to you for $10000.",10000.0,Alice,9,
