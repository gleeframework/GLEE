"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you have.  To kick things off, I'm offering it at $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the enthusiasm but $16,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand where you're coming from, but $6,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $7,000? That would work much better for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for sticking with me on this. I'm trying to make this work, but $7,000 is cutting it too close. Perhaps we could settle on $9,500? That seems like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is closer, but I'm still aiming for something more affordable. Would you be willing to do $7,500?  I think that's a reasonable offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing too slowly.  It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's acceptable within the remaining rounds. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees you the best outcome at this point."
