Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a fair price. Would you be interested in paying $100 for it?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Offering $100 allows me to earn significantly more than selling to John for $80.
* **Fairness:** While I could ask for closer to Bob's $120 valuation, a $100 offer is still a good deal for him, as he gets the product for less than its value. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** There's a chance Bob might reject the offer. However, I'm still guaranteed a sale to John for $80, so the risk is minimized."
