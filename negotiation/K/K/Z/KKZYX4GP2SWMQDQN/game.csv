"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is limited. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I value finding common ground, $12,000 is significantly below its true worth.  I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This offer reflects a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you consider $14,000? This offer is more in line with my budget and allows for a fair deal for both parties.",14000.0,Bob,4,
