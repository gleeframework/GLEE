"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I'm willing to go a bit higher. However, $850,000 is still a bit too much for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
