"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible, it's best to reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm looking to get the product at a price closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than what he's hoping to pay. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to the $750,000 range. Rejecting the offer allows for another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, and I'm willing to go a bit higher. However, $850,000 is still a bit too much for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}
