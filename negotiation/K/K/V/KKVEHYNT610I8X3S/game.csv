"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm still a bit above where I'm comfortable.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair compromise given the value of the product to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that we're close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you at $920,000, which is a slight compromise from my original price. This is the best I can do, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,
