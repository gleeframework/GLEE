"I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1,400,000?  This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $1,300,000. Can we meet in the middle again?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This feels fair for both of us and lets us move forward. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,5,
