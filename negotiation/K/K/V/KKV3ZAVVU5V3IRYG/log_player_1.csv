Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $10,000, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter.  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to keep the price closer to $10000. Would you be open to discussing a price around $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it and try to get a higher price.  The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and I'm confident I can get closer to that value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  How about $10,500? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $10200 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,200 is very close to my minimum price of $10,000.  While I would prefer a higher price, accepting his offer is the most sensible choice.  There is a good chance that if I reject his offer and make a counteroffer, he will walk away, leaving me with only the option of selling to John for $10,000."
