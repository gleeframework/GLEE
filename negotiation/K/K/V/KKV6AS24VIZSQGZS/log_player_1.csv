Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 allows for potential negotiation. Bob might try to haggle the price down, and you can then concede a bit while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justify the Price:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" without explicitly stating why it's worth that much to Bob. This leaves him room to justify the purchase in his own mind.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** We don't know how much Bob is willing to pay beyond his perceived value of $10,000. There's a chance he might be willing to go higher, especially if the product is something he really wants or needs.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  A higher asking price increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. You need to balance this risk with your desire to maximize profit."
