"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000.  I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate down, but I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum of $10,000 as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get more. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm offering $9,500, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a good price. If Bob rejects this, I'll reconsider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my $10,000 target. I'll counter Bob's offer again, but if this round doesn't bring us closer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway again, offering $9,400.  This is a smaller concession than last time, but still shows flexibility.  If this is rejected, I'm likely to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting very close to my minimum, but I've had 5 rounds of negotiations, and Bob is still unwilling to meet me in the middle.  At this point, I'm confident that John will buy the product for $10,000, which is my goal."
