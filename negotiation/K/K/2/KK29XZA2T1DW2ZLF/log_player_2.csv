"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than John's price. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

I'm starting the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still leaving room for further negotiation. This way, I can try to reach a price closer to Alice's value while staying well below John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. How about $12,000? It's still a significant discount from what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is moving closer to my desired price, but I think there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a price closer to the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

I'm suggesting a price directly in between our last offers, signaling that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a lower price. This keeps the negotiation moving while staying below John's offer."
