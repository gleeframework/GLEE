"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to both of us. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves some room for profit for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750? That seems like a fair compromise, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
