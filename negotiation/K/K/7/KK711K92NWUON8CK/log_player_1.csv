Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and is worth a significant sum. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and potential."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 creates a substantial profit margin while still being enticing to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The price leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly interested, potentially leading to an even higher sale price.

By starting high but not unreasonable, I increase my chances of securing the best possible deal."
