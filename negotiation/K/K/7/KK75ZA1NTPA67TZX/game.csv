,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $110?  That's still a great deal for you and it's closer to what I need.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to sell for $108.75. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",108.75,Alice,5,
