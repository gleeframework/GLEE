"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,050,000? This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while still leaving room for you to profit. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial offer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $950,000 is getting closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not satisfied. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
