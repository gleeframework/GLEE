"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to lose that much money.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to make this work for both of us.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Let's see if we can find a solution."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,500? That's a fair compromise, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, his offer of $9,500 is still below the $15,000 I could get from John.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's meet in the middle. "", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair offer considering we're both making compromises. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, it's still not enough for me to make a profit that I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to reach a more favorable price, but I'm also aware that time is ticking.  If we don't reach an agreement soon, I might decide to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?  It's a fair compromise, and it'll allow us to close this deal.  We're running out of time, so let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 11750}
