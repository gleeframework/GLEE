"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $10,000.  Let me know what you think!",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to make this work for both of us.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Let's see if we can find a solution.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  However, $12,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $9,500? That's a fair compromise, I believe.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's meet in the middle. ",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $10,500? That's a fair offer considering we're both making compromises.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?  It's a fair compromise, and it'll allow us to close this deal.  We're running out of time, so let's make this happen.",11750.0,Alice,7,
