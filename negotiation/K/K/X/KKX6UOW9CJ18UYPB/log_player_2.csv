Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to make this work for both of us.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  Let's see if we can find a solution.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  Let's meet in the middle.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,750?  It's a fair compromise, and it'll allow us to close this deal.  We're running out of time, so let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is not budging enough, and you have a guaranteed offer from John at $10,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a higher risk of not meeting your goal of staying under $10,000."
