"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. This is a fair offer considering the value it brings.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still beyond my reach. Given the value I place on this product, I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while remaining within my budget. Let's find a compromise.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1,300,000 is still outside my budget, I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  This shows my commitment to acquiring this product, but I need to stay within my financial limits. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
