"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a reasonable starting point, higher than my minimum but not so high that it will immediately scare Bob away. I want to see if he's interested at this price point before potentially lowering it in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for $10,000, which is below my minimum. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm offering $13,000. This is still above my minimum, but it's a lower price than my initial offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping this will entice Bob to come closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I am starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, I am not willing to sell the product for under my minimum of $12,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a significant drop from my previous offer but still above my minimum price.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the limited rounds remaining.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid risking a deal falling through completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum price.  While I would have preferred a higher price, I'm concerned about running out of time. If I reject this offer, there is a real risk that I won't be able to get a better price in the remaining rounds, and I may end up having to sell to John for the same price. It's better to accept this offer and secure the sale."
