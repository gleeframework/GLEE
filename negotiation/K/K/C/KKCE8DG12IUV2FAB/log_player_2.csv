It's always beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price. You can likely get a better deal than $900,000, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best first step."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal range.  Alice might reject this, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation."

Alice is coming down in price, but it's still above my ideal range.  I'll continue to negotiate and try to get closer to my target price."

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product but still aiming for a lower price. This demonstrates flexibility and hopefully encourages Alice to meet me in the middle."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

While I'd ideally like to get a lower price, Alice is getting closer to my target range and it's a much better deal than buying from John.  Accepting the offer is the best course of action at this point."
