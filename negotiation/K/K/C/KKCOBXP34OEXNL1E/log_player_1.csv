"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I think you'd find it valuable. I'm asking for $170 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($100) and Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Appear Flexible:**  By starting high, I'm prepared to come down during the negotiation, which might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Time is Money:**  I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer at $100. However, maximizing my profit with Bob is the priority for now. I'll keep John in mind as a safety net if the negotiation goes poorly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, which is expected. I need to negotiate upwards from here.  Selling to John right now would mean settling for my minimum, and I believe I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Target:**  I'm dropping the price significantly from $170 to $125 to show flexibility and encourage Bob.  Importantly, this price is still comfortably above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  Suggesting we ""meet in the middle"" frames the negotiation positively and implies a sense of fairness.  Hopefully, this encourages Bob to counter higher than his initial $80 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $125 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

We're making progress! Bob is now negotiating above his initial offer, showing he's willing to pay more than his perceived value. I still believe there's room to negotiate upwards from $90 before settling for John's $100 offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""You drive a hard bargain, Bob! I can tell this product would be in good hands with you. How about $110? That's a pretty significant price drop from my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 110}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Bargaining:**  Acknowledging Bob's negotiation skills can help maintain a positive atmosphere and encourage further concessions.
* **Highlight the Price Drop:**  By pointing out the significant drop from the initial price, I'm emphasizing the deal Bob is getting.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Offering $110 puts us closer to the halfway point between our last two offers ($90 and $125), showing movement and willingness to compromise, while still targeting a price above my safety net ($100)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the price drop, but I'm still a bit far from my budget. How about we meet at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly demonstrating price resistance beyond $95.  While I could push for a bit more, accepting his offer of $95 is a good outcome:

* **Profitable:**  It's still a profit above my minimum of $100.
* **Saves Time:**  Accepting now avoids further negotiation rounds and the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's always a chance Bob might lower his offer or walk away entirely in future rounds. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing him."
