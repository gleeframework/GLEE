"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, and I think you'll find it's a great deal. Let me know if this works for you!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle, and I'd like to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that I believe is close to our ideal value. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
