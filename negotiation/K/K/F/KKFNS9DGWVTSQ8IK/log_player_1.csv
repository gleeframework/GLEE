"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this valuable product for sale. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $200, which I believe is a fair price considering its quality and features."", ""product_price"": 200}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $150 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the maximum he values the product at, and it's the same amount John is offering. There's no room for further negotiation with Bob, and waiting might lead to him lowering his offer. Taking John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome for me in this scenario."
