"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I believe this price reflects the value it brings while remaining fair to both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,300,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Could we settle at $1,220,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",1220000.0,Bob,4,
