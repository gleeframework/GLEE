Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I believe this price reflects the value it brings while remaining fair to both of us.
