"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I'm open to discussing further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is way too high for me. This product would be worth $6,000 to me. So, I could consider buying it for $7,000.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $7,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  Could you consider something closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $12,000 is still too far from what I'm willing to pay.  Could you meet me halfway at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to the product's value.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting closer!  $11,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,500?  That's a significant move on my part.",9500.0,Bob,6,
