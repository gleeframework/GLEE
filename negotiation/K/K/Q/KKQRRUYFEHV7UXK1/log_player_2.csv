"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not a good deal for Bob to buy at $12,000. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm ready to offer $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still more than he's willing to pay. Bob should try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,200. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has been stubborn, and the price is still too high for Bob. Even though Alice claims it's a one-time offer, it's unlikely she'll lower the price significantly in the next round. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $10,000 and avoid further negotiation."
