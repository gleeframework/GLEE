"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm ready to offer $9,000 for it. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go below $11,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,200. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
