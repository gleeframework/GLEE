Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a great price. How about $120?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer starts high but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if he's not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than my minimum of $80, I can likely get closer to my desired price with another round of negotiation. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $110? That's still a great value for you, and it's closer to what I'm hoping to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
