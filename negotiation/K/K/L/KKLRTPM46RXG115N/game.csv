"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1050000. This is a very good deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $950000 is still a bit shy of what I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000, but I'm not going any lower than that. This is my final offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
