``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point. It's above my minimum value, and leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $14,000 at this time. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $14,000 is just too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $16,000? This is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet in the middle.  How about $15,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us, and we can finalize the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500

Bob's offer of $15,500 is above my minimum price of $15,000 and a good compromise. I'll accept his offer and finalize the transaction."
