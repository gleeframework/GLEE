"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $120.  Let me know if that works for you.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm happy to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $170 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  This is my final offer, as I can purchase the product from John for $120.",140.0,Bob,4,
