{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by leaving some room for Bob to counteroffer, while still ensuring you receive a good price. It also frames the offer as a good deal for Bob, making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and save some money. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher sale price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8,750. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,750 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. Accepting his offer guarantees me a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or even a sale to John at $8,000."
