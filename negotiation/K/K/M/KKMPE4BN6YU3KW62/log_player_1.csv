"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) but still significantly higher than Bob's estimated value ($8,000). This creates room for negotiation and leaves me with a potential profit. It also signals that I am serious about selling, but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) and far from my initial offer.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from the previous round, but still keeping it well above Bob's offer. This demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise while still protecting my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to achieve. I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired price point. I'm not yet at a point where selling to John for $15,000 seems like the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm further lowering my price, but still holding out for a price above $10,000. This is a compromise to show Bob I'm willing to reach a deal, but I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum. This should ideally push Bob to make a higher counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Although Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) and I'm not desperate to sell. I have 4 more rounds to negotiate and still have the option to sell to John for a higher price. I believe I can still push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10200}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price again to $10,200. This is a small compromise, but it shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching a deal. I'm hoping that this counteroffer will be enough to convince Bob to accept and close the deal. However, I still have the option to sell to John for $15,000 if Bob continues to reject my offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We are now in round 8, leaving only 2 rounds left.  Bob's offer of $9,900 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, I will take that route.  It's not ideal to leave money on the table, but it's better than selling for a price I'm unhappy with.  Further negotiation with Bob might result in a higher offer, but the risk of not reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds and losing out on the opportunity to sell to John is too high."
