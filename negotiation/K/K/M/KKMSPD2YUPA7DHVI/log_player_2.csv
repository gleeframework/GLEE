{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below my target.

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,050,000 is still too high for me. There's still room for negotiation to get closer to my ideal price point. I'll continue trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $950,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a compromise, but it's the lowest price I'm willing to consider. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 6

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm getting closer to my target price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $1,025,000 is still not enough for me to meet my target. I'm starting to think we might be at an impasse. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll give you a 1% discount, which brings the price down to $1,067,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finally reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,067,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are running out of time, and Alice's final offer of $1,067,500 is still too high. While it's a small concession, it's not enough to make it worthwhile for me.  I'm better off buying the product from John at $1,500,000 rather than risking the possibility of not reaching an agreement with Alice in the last round. I'm willing to pay a higher price to guarantee a purchase."
