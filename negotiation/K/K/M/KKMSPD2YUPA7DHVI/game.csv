"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a good compromise. I believe it's fair for both of us. Let's reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $950,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This is a compromise, but it's the lowest price I'm willing to consider. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, but $1,000,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to give you one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm getting closer to my target price. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $1,025,000 is still not enough for me to meet my target. I'm starting to think we might be at an impasse. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000, but I'll throw in a small concession: I'll give you a 1% discount, which brings the price down to $1,067,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finally reach a deal.",1067500.0,Alice,9,
