Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's in excellent condition and I believe it's a great deal for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000** is a good starting point. It's a significant markup from my minimum price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  
* **The message** is friendly and open to discussion, while also emphasizing the value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** I'm aiming high but not unreasonable. 
* **Prepared for counteroffers:** This offer anticipates a counteroffer from Bob.
* **The John option:**  Having the John offer gives me leverage to accept or reject counteroffers based on my confidence in achieving a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my desired price range.** While $11,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my target.
* **Negotiation is key:**  I'm confident I can get Bob to agree on a higher price through further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer that's closer to my initial price but still reflects a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about $12,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to continue negotiating. 
* **Emphasizing fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win for both parties.

**Strategy:**

* **Progressing towards a deal:**  This offer shows Bob that I'm serious about selling but also that I'm not willing to settle for a low price.
* **Keeping the John option open:**  I'm still prepared to sell to John if Bob doesn't accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Let me know if that's something you'd consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my desired price:**  $11,500 is only $500 away from my initial offer and much closer to my target than John's offer.
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  While I could try for a higher price,  the risk of further negotiation could lead to a lower price or a breakdown in the deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Minimizing risk:**  Accepting this offer minimizes the risk of getting a lower price from Bob or having to settle with John.
* **Profit over perfection:**  While $11,500 isn't my absolute dream price, it's a good deal and secures a profitable sale."
