"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm looking to save as much as possible, and I'm not sure if $115 is within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not sure if $105 is the best price for me. I'm willing to pay $95, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $100? That's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's make this happen.",100.0,Alice,5,
