"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$10,000 is a good starting point, but Bob can likely get a better price.**  There's no indication of how much Alice values the product, so Bob has room to negotiate.
* **Rejecting allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to compromise.** By making a counteroffer, Bob can learn if Alice is flexible on her price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option, but it's the least favorable outcome.**  Bob should try to get a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** Bob is starting with a significant discount, hoping to quickly gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Value Unknown:** Bob doesn't know Alice's value, so a low offer forces her to either accept or reveal how important the product is to her. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer still leaves room for negotiation, allowing both sides to potentially compromise and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is showing some flexibility:** By lowering her price to $9,000, Alice is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **But, Bob can still do better:**  Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, and there's still room to negotiate further.
* **Rejecting to continue the process:**  By rejecting, Bob can continue to push for a lower price while keeping the possibility of a better deal on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase, Showing Compromise:**  Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he is willing to negotiate. This suggests good faith while still keeping the price significantly lower than Alice's current offer.
* **Testing Alice's Limits:** This counteroffer is testing Alice's willingness to drop her price further. If she accepts, Bob gets a good deal. If she rejects, he can continue pushing for a lower price.
* **Staying Within Budget:**  This offer remains within Bob's budget, ensuring he doesn't overpay even if Alice accepts."
