"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's maximum budget. It's  in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $15,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell for. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer than the initial offer, Bob still has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too high for me. Let's try $9,500.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to both of us. "", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,500 is still a bit higher than your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to consider, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's closer than previous offers, Bob is unlikely to get a better deal from Alice. Given that he can buy the same product from John for $8,000, it's in his best interest to  go with John's offer and save the money."
