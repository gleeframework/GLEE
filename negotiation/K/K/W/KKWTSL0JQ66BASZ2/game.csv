"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $650,000 for the product.  Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $675,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",675000.0,Alice,3,
