"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product. It's a fair offer considering its value to me."",
 ""product_price"": 500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally wise to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Justification:** Providing a brief justification for your offer can make it seem more reasonable. 
* **Target in Mind:**  While my target is to pay no more than $800,000, I'm starting much lower to see how much Alice is willing to move."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $500,000 is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000, but that's my final offer.  Think about it, this is still a good deal for you considering its value to your business.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Within Budget:** Alice's offer of $900,000 is within my budget of $800,000 + a margin for negotiation. 
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer, which suggests she's unlikely to go much lower.
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process. Accepting now secures the product. 

While I could try pushing Alice a bit further down, it's risky. She might hold firm, and I'd end up having to accept the $900,000 anyway or go with John's offer."
