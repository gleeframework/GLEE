"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $15000 to you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price.  He should reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $10500 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11500. This is still a great price for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $11,500 is better than John's offer, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He should reject the offer and see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to offer $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, I'm not ready to go as low as $11000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product for $11250. This is still a great price for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,250, which is a good deal for Bob. At this point, it's becoming risky to keep rejecting offers. If Bob rejects this offer, there's a chance Alice will become less willing to negotiate, or even raise her price. It's also likely that Bob won't be able to get a better deal in the remaining rounds.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking a worse outcome."
