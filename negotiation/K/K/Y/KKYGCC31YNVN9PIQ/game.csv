"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my usual asking price. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  $10,500 is the lowest I can go. Let's meet in the middle!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,500, which is a fair compromise between our two positions.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 still doesn't quite work for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to sell for $10,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $10,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,750, which is a good compromise and gets us closer to an agreement. Let's make this happen.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I really appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I'm trying to be flexible here. I can't go any lower than $9,900.  If you're serious about this deal, let's close it now.",9900.0,Alice,7,
