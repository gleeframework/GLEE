"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am currently looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to this amount? I'm eager to make a purchase, and I believe we could reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a specific price point. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $850,000, recognizing the value you see in my product.  This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,3,
