"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate down to $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I'm asking for $110. This is a fair price that accounts for the value of the product and my own costs. Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this, but $107 is still below my target price. Let's try to meet in the middle. How about $109? I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.",109.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us. However, $108 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last compromise, but I need to see $110. If we can't agree on this, I'll have to look at other options. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,7,
