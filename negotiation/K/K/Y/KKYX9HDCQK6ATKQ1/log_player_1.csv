Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $995,000. I think that's a very fair price considering its potential value."", ""product_price"": 995000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** While I have a guaranteed offer from John, my goal is to maximize my profit. Offering the product to Bob first at a price slightly lower than John's offer allows for the possibility of a higher return.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $995,000 creates a sense of urgency and a good deal for Bob. It's significantly less than my valuation and still leaves me with a substantial profit margin.
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, the potential reward of an extra $95,000 outweighs the risk of going directly to John."
