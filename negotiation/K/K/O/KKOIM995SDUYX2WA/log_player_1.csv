"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming for the highest possible profit. By starting significantly above both our minimum and Bob's perceived value, we leave room for negotiation and potential anchoring.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and inviting discussion, which sets a collaborative tone for the negotiation.
* **Strategic Cushion:**  This initial offer provides a substantial cushion to potentially go lower while still remaining above our $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Option:**  We keep the John option in our back pocket, giving us leverage if the negotiations don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in this product but need a price closer to my limit of $1,500,000. How about we start at $1,700,000? This reflects the value I see and opens the door for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still a significant jump from his initial statement.  We have room to negotiate and try to draw him closer to our desired price point. We're not desperate to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,300,000 represents the premium value of this product, I understand your position.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $2,000,000. This offer reflects my commitment to reaching a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant drop from our initial offer to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Above Target:**  The $2,000,000 price is still significantly above both our minimum and Bob's stated limit, providing room for further negotiation. 
* **Justification:**  We're framing the concession as a move towards a ""fair deal"" rather than a desperate reduction.  
* **Time Consideration:** We still have several rounds left, allowing us to gradually move towards a more agreeable price without seeming overly eager."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. While I recognize the value of this product, $2,000,000 remains too high for me. To find a mutually acceptable price, I'm willing to go to $1,800,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a reasonable starting point for us to continue this negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trend:** Bob is moving closer to our desired price range with each counteroffer. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We still have time and room to negotiate. Accepting now would leave potential profit on the table.
* **John as Backup:**  The option to sell to John for our minimum provides a safety net, allowing us to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle on $1,900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your investment."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $1,900,000, we're meeting Bob halfway between his last offer ($1,800,000) and our previous counteroffer ($2,000,000). This common negotiation tactic can feel like a fair compromise to both parties. 
* **Stronger Language:**  The phrase ""settle on"" implies a degree of finality, gently nudging Bob towards an agreement.
* **Value Emphasis:** We're reiterating the product's value to justify the price while acknowledging Bob's ""investment,"" subtly appealing to his desire for a worthwhile purchase.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We're still above our minimum and have room to negotiate slightly downward if necessary in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're making progress, but $1,900,000 is still a bit outside of my comfortable range. To reach a final agreement, I'm prepared to offer $1,850,000. This represents a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it reflects the value of this product while remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Accepting this offer gives us a profit of $350,000 ($1,850,000 - $1,500,000). This is a significant return.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While we could potentially push for a slightly higher price, Bob's increments are getting smaller. The risk of him walking away and the time cost of further negotiation likely outweigh the potential for a marginal gain. 
* **Secure Deal:** It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely by being too aggressive in our demands."
