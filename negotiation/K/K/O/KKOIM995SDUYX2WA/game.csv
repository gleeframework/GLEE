"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $2,300,000 is far above my budget. I'm interested in this product but need a price closer to my limit of $1,500,000. How about we start at $1,700,000? This reflects the value I see and opens the door for a mutually beneficial deal.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,300,000 represents the premium value of this product, I understand your position.  To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $2,000,000. This offer reflects my commitment to reaching a fair deal.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. While I recognize the value of this product, $2,000,000 remains too high for me. To find a mutually acceptable price, I'm willing to go to $1,800,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a reasonable starting point for us to continue this negotiation.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we settle on $1,900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your investment.",1900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're making progress, but $1,900,000 is still a bit outside of my comfortable range. To reach a final agreement, I'm prepared to offer $1,850,000. This represents a significant commitment on my part, and I believe it reflects the value of this product while remaining within my budget.",1850000.0,Bob,6,
