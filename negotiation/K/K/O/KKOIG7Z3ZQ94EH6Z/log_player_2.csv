"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $9,500. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is less than the $10,000 John is asking, there's room for negotiation.  Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering."
