``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to Bob, hoping to secure a good deal. I'm also using positive language to make the offer more appealing. If he rejects, I'm ready to negotiate further, but always keeping John's offer as a fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my target.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's current proposal. This will keep the negotiation going and hopefully lead to a better outcome for me."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied. I'll counter again with a slightly lower price, but still above his current offer. I want to try and squeeze out a bit more profit before potentially settling or going with John's offer."

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but it seems like we're at a stalemate. While another counteroffer might be possible, it's getting risky.  I'm worried about going back and forth endlessly.  Since I can get my minimum from John, it's safer to take the guaranteed deal."
