"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point to maximize my profit.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly tone helps build rapport and potentially encourage Bob to accept.
* **Mutually Beneficial:**  Highlighting that it's a good deal for both of us can make Bob more inclined to agree.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to get as close to $120 as possible without risking a deal break. I'll adjust my offers based on Bob's response and how many rounds are left. If Bob rejects, I'll lower the price slightly but not too drastically, leaving room for further negotiation. If it seems like we're too far apart, I'll consider selling to John to secure a guaranteed $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for More:**  While $90 is a good price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point of $120.
* **Negotiation Space:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price, leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Round Count:**  We're only in round 2, leaving plenty of time to reach a favorable agreement.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above his offer. I'll aim to find a compromise that's mutually beneficial and helps us close the deal. I'll continue to monitor the remaining rounds and my potential profit versus selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal. I'm willing to come down to $95. Let's split the difference and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer ($100) and his counteroffer ($90).
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $95 still allows me to earn a good profit while showing flexibility.
* **Urgency:**  The phrase ""make this happen"" adds a sense of urgency, subtly encouraging Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

By offering a lower price, I'm showing good faith and willingness to negotiate.  I hope this encourages Bob to accept, but I'm also prepared to counter again if necessary. I'll continue to adjust my offers based on Bob's responses and the remaining rounds, keeping in mind the option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I think I can do better. How about $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.
* **Strategic Negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially push for a higher price.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  With 6 rounds remaining, there's still time to negotiate and find a more favorable deal.

**Strategy:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price between $85 and my previous offer of $95.  I'll aim for a compromise that's closer to my target price while also keeping in mind the potential of selling to John.  The remaining rounds will be crucial to determine if I can reach a deal that meets my minimum profit threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to go down to $90.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again offering a compromise, this time by meeting Bob halfway between my previous offer ($95) and his last offer ($85).
* **Emphasizing Fair Deal:** I highlight the price as being ""fair for both of us"", aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm adding urgency by mentioning ""closing this deal"", hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is designed to signal my willingness to negotiate, but also to demonstrate a clear limit. If Bob rejects, I'll seriously consider selling to John, as the remaining rounds are dwindling and I'm getting closer to my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really close, but I think I can squeeze out a bit more. How about $87? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $87 is only $3 below my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds left. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to $90, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially losing the deal isn't worth it at this point.

**Strategy:**

Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and a profit, albeit a smaller one than I initially hoped for.  Given the dwindling rounds and the chance of Bob rejecting future offers, it's a safer choice to close the deal now.  The $87 price is still above my minimum and represents a decent outcome in this scenario."
