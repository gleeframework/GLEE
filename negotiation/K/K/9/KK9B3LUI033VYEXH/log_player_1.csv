Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe I can't proceed with a purchase at $11,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,500? I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I will reject Bob's offer, as $9,500 is below my minimum acceptable price. I will try to counteroffer to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but I'm not able to go as low as $9,500.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,250? I believe this price is still fair, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's better than selling to John for the same amount, and it avoids further negotiation."
