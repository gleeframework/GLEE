Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant resources and opening new opportunities. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential return on investment for your specific needs."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you have room to aim high with Bob. 
* **Perceived Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's unique value to Bob, aiming to justify a higher price. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering at $1,500,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing above your minimum. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's guaranteed offer. If Bob knows your fallback, this approach could backfire."
