I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit. However, it's also realistic considering my minimum value of $800,000 and the potential for negotiation. 

This strategy sets the stage for a good negotiation. It allows me to see what Bob's willingness to pay is while still leaving room for me to adjust my price if necessary."
