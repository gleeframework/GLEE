"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $15000.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $15000 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $16500?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away happy. ",16500.0,Alice,3,
