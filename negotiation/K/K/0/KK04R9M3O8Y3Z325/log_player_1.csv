This offer is a starting point.  It's lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000, but it's also significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price.  While it's tempting to take the $9,000, I'm not willing to sell for less than $12,000 at this point. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to reach a middle ground."
