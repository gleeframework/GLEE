"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $120, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle somewhere? Would you be willing to do $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $90 is simply not enough for me.  Let's meet halfway again.  I'm willing to go down to $100, but that's my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll need to move on.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference one last time and settle at $95?  This is my final offer.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting a bit frustrated with this back and forth. $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $98, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'm going to sell to John.",98.0,Alice,7,
