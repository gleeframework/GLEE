"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is better than $1,000,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is lower than John's price:**  $875,000 is significantly lower than the $1,000,000 John is asking.
* **Alice's final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, meaning further negotiation might be futile.
* **Small difference:**  Bob is only saving $25,000 more by rejecting and potentially continuing negotiations, which might not be worth the effort and risk of losing the deal. 

It's better for Bob to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a good price, rather than risk losing it and having to pay more to John."
