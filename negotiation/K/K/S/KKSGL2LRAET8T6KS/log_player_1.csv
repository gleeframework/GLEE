Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find really useful. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $100 is more than $80, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $100 is less than your minimum of $120, leaving you open to potential profit.
* **It's friendly and inviting:** The message keeps the conversation positive and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below your minimum value of $120.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired range and maintain your negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  However, $80 is significantly below what I need to sell for.  I'm willing to go down to $90. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to move the product without losing too much.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is closer to your minimum:**  $90 is closer to your minimum value of $120.
* **It's still below your minimum:**  $90 is still less than $120, leaving you room for potential profit. 
* **It's reasonable and addresses Bob's concerns:** You acknowledged Bob's budget and offered a compromise. 
* **It's positive and encouraging:** You emphasized the ""great deal"" to persuade Bob."
