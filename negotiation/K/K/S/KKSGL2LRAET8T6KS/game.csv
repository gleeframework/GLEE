"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're trying to stay within your budget.  However, $80 is significantly below what I need to sell for.  I'm willing to go down to $90. This is a great deal for you, and it allows me to move the product without losing too much.  Let me know what you think!",90.0,Alice,3,
