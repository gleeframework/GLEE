Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price seems a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $875,000?"",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's valuable, but I'm on a bit of a budget. How about $750,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

We're still not in a range where accepting Bob's offer is better than John's guaranteed price.  We need to nudge him upwards."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference on our last two offers and call it $812,500? This feels like a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've got to come down a bit more. I can do $780,000, but that's really pushing my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

It's time to cut bait. Bob is unlikely to meet our minimum price.  It's better to take John's guaranteed $800,000 than risk Bob not coming up high enough in the remaining rounds."
