"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and still a great profit for me. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $800,000 for the product. This aligns closely with its value to me and also leaves some room for profit for you.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $800,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $900,000? This still gives you a substantial benefit and allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. I've carefully considered my budget and am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price reflects the value it holds for me while allowing you to maintain a reasonable profit margin. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",850000.0,Bob,4,
