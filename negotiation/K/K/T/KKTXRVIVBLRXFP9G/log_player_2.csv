"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $10000. It's a real gem, and I think it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  You have information that the product is worth $10,000 to you, but you don't know what it's worth to Alice. This means there's potential to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, and I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm offering a significant discount ($2,000) from Alice's initial price. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but am also trying to get a better deal.
* **Fairness:**  $8,000 is still a decent price, and hopefully, it's attractive enough for Alice to consider.  
* **Openness:** The message emphasizes my interest in the product, which might encourage Alice to be more flexible."
