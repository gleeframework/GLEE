"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price range. By rejecting, Bob can attempt to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  $950,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,025,000 is closer to his desired price range, he can still attempt to negotiate a lower price. It's worth trying to reach a compromise that's closer to his initial counteroffer of $950,000."
