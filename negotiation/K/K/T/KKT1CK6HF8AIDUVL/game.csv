"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. Given its unique features, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I place on this product, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and for presenting your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is a significant jump, I believe this product offers unique value that justifies a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000.  I'm confident this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you believe in the value of this product, and I do too. However, $1,700,000 is still beyond what I can reasonably afford.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000.  This reflects a significant increase from my initial offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's find a middle ground.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  This offer reflects my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating but I'm nearing my limit.  $1,450,000 is still a significant amount over my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000.  I'm hoping we can reach a compromise that works for both of us.  This would be my final offer.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
