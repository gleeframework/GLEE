"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob's budget.  He can get the same product from John for significantly less.  There's no reason to accept the offer.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives Bob a chance to get a better price from Alice, or at least understand her limits before he decides to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for his maximum budget of $800,000. This counteroffer sets the bar at his absolute limit, and will either lead to Alice accepting the offer or initiating a negotiation where she may be willing to come down slightly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. He knows he can get the product for $800,000 from John.  Rejecting and counter-offering again gives Bob the chance to potentially get a better price from Alice, or at least understand her negotiation space further before he decides to purchase from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for the lowest possible price, but recognizes he may need to compromise slightly.  Offering $900,000 represents a compromise from his original offer, but is still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. This approach shows he is serious about negotiation, but also willing to move a bit to potentially reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unwilling to come down further than $1,050,000, which is still outside Bob's budget.  Given that Bob can purchase the same product from John for $800,000, it makes more sense to simply accept John's offer. Further negotiation with Alice seems unlikely to result in a better price for Bob."
