Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept less from Bob.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, so he won't pay more than that.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There is no overlap between your minimum price and Bob's maximum price. This means a deal is impossible unless one of you changes your valuation.

**The Strategy**

Since a deal within Bob's valuation is impossible, you have two options:

1. **High Anchor:**  Start with a very high price to see if Bob might be willing to pay more than his initial valuation. This is a risky strategy as it might turn him off completely.

2. **Go with John:** Knowing you have a guaranteed offer, focus on selling to John. There's no point wasting time with Bob.

**The Offer (High Anchor Approach)**

While a deal is unlikely, here's how a high anchor offer could look:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it for $1,800,000. This is a rare chance to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Justification:** With a high anchor, you need to justify the price. Emphasize the product's ""unique value"" and ""potential"" even if those exceed Bob's current perception.
* **Alternative:**  Let Bob know that if he's not interested, you have other buyers lined up. This creates a sense of urgency and scarcity.

**The Realistic Approach:**

Since the ZOPA doesn't exist, it's probably best to move on to John. You're guaranteed your minimum price without having to negotiate."
