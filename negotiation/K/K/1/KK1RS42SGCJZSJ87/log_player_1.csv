{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $100, offering it to Bob at a slightly lower price increases the chance of a quicker sale. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $95 is still a significant profit margin for me (since it's worth $100 to me).  It's also a price that's likely tempting to Bob since it's significantly less than the $100 he would have to pay elsewhere. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While this offer doesn't explicitly invite haggling, it leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly price-sensitive."
