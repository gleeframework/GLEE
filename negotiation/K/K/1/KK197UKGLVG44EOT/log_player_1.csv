"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find immense value in. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for us to begin our discussion."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming to secure a significant portion of the potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer acknowledges that this is a starting point, signaling to Bob that I'm open to discussion and finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, reminding him of its potential benefits and justifying the high price. 
 
 This approach balances my goal of maximizing profit with the need to engage Bob in a negotiation that could last several rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value it might hold, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price of $1,300,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is tempting, I believe I can still negotiate a better price.  My minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000, and Bob's perceived value is $1,500,000, leaving room for a compromise.  I'm willing to engage in further negotiation to try and close the deal at a higher point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations. After careful thought, I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of this unique product."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I've countered by meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value to justify the price, subtly reminding Bob of what's at stake. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** This counteroffer still allows for potential profit above my minimum while encouraging Bob to move closer to my desired selling point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Alice. Thank you for your flexibility. I'd like to counter with an offer of $1,325,000. I believe this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It exceeds my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and provides a healthy profit margin. 

While I could continue negotiating, Bob's incremental increases suggest he's nearing his upper limit. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids the risk of him reducing his offer or stalling negotiations further."
