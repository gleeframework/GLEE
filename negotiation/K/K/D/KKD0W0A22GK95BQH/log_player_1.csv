(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","Bob's offer of $130 is lower than my initial offer, but still higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept. Since I want to earn as much as possible, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.
