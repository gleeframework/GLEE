"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer! I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think a fair price would be $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still not willing to pay $110. I'd be willing to go up to $100, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $115. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make one more counteroffer. However, I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'd like to make a final offer: I'll pay $105 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $80.",105.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $105. I've already made a significant concession, and I think $115 is a fair price considering the product's value. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $112.50. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price. What do you think?",112.5,Alice,7,
