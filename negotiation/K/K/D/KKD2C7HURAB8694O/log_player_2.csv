"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is better than Alice's initial value of $120, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being flexible. However, $110 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get as close to his maximum budget as possible while still leaving room for negotiation.  Offering $85 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it's still a fair starting point for negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a lower price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Bob should continue negotiating to try and get the price down further.  He can still get the product from John for $80, so he has no pressure to accept an offer above his budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $100 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $90?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to his budget, offering $90.  This is a compromise that shows he's serious about buying the product but also doesn't want to overpay. By highlighting the fairness of the price, Bob aims to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and encourage her to accept the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $90, which would be $95. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is closer to Bob's budget than previous offers, it still exceeds his maximum of $80. He can still secure the product from John for a cheaper price, so it's better to continue negotiating for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $95 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, which is a fair compromise considering my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually increasing his offer while staying below his maximum budget. Offering $92 shows Alice that he's serious about buying the product while still maintaining some leverage. It's a small increase from his previous offer, indicating a willingness to compromise while remaining within his price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $92. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $95 and $92, which would be $93.75. I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $93.75 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  At this point, Bob has exhausted his negotiation options with Alice and has only one round left. Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal, Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $80. This guarantees him the product at the best possible price within his budget."
