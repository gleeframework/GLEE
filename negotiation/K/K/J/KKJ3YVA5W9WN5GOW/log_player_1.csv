"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This initial offer sets a high price, reflecting the product's value to me.  It also opens the door for negotiation and leaves room for a potential compromise.  I'm aiming to maximize my profit while also leaving the option to sell to John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit high for my budget though.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $130? It's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering a compromise by lowering my price to $130. This shows Bob that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get a fair price Alice.  How about we split the difference and meet in the middle at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $115 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I want to try and get a bit closer to my desired price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'll reject his offer and continue to explore a potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $115 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we settle at $125? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

This offer is a further compromise, showing Bob my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a profit margin for myself. I'm hoping this will be the final offer that secures a sale with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to go up a bit to $118, but that's really the most I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $118. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $118
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer of $118 is tempting, we've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and haven't reached a price that's satisfactory for both of us. The time is running out, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for a higher price.  I'll choose to sell the product to John, ensuring a guaranteed profit for me."
