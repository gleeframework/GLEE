Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,075,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $1,080,000 is getting close to my minimum, I want to try and squeeze out a bit more.  I'm confident that I can get a better price if I continue negotiating with Bob, and I'd rather not sell to John for $1,000,000 just yet."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not the ideal price, it's very close to my minimum.  We've gone through several rounds of negotiations and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, he'll walk away or I'll be forced to sell to John at a lower price. I'm happy to close the deal at $1,080,000."
