"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for a product worth at least $1,000,000 to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above my budget of $800,000.  It's not even close to a deal I'm willing to accept.  I'll reject and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above my maximum budget. This shows I'm serious about making a deal but also that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right. This gives me some room to negotiate in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it still leaves you with a significant profit margin. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. While it's a decrease from her previous offer, it's still above my maximum budget. I'll reject and continue to try to negotiate a lower price.  I'm still hopeful we can find a compromise, but I'm also getting closer to considering John's offer as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $1,025,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which gives you a solid profit.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and move closer to her position.  It's a strong offer but still within my budget. I hope this will lead to a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $925,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be at least $975,000.  This is still a good profit for you, and it's the closest I can get to meeting you halfway.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but it's still above my maximum.  I'm going to try to negotiate a little further. I'm also getting a little nervous as we're halfway through the negotiations, and I still haven't settled on a price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet at $950,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  Let's be reasonable and get this done!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going up just a little bit from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also staying firm on my budget. I'm emphasizing that this is a fair price for both of us and hoping to get this deal finalized.  The pressure is on as we're nearing the halfway point."
