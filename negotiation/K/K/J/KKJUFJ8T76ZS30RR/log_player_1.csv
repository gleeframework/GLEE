"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal for a product worth at least $1,000,000 to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's above Bob's value but still leaving room for negotiation.  This also shows him the product's worth to me, potentially encouraging him to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below my minimum target of $1,000,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him closer to my price range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is just too low for me.  Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it still leaves you with a significant profit margin. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $1,025,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, which gives you a solid profit.  It's a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $925,000 is getting closer to my minimum target, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push him a little further. I have a few more rounds to go, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $925,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to be at least $975,000.  This is still a good profit for you, and it's the closest I can get to meeting you halfway.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $975,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet at $950,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.  Let's be reasonable and get this done! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiation is becoming increasingly difficult, and I'm starting to run out of time. While $950,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum target of $1,000,000. It's better to secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than risk getting a lower price with Bob. I'm going to sell the product to John."
