Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging its value to you.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while still keeping the price below Alice's desired range. The message emphasizes the compromise and fairness of this offer, encouraging Alice to accept it."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I'll offer it to you for $775,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While $775,000 is still higher than my ideal price, it's a good deal compared to both John's offer and the initial negotiations.  Accepting this offer saves a significant amount of money and avoids the risk of further negotiation or going with John."
