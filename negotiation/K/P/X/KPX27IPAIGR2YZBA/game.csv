"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping for a lower price. Given the product's value to me and your own needs, I'm willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to me is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging its value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000.  This is a fair compromise that acknowledges your value for the product while getting me closer to my target price. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I'll offer it to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.",775000.0,Alice,5,
