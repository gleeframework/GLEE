,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $18000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my needs and the value you place on it.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still reflects the value I believe the product holds.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14000 is still beyond my budget. I'm committed to purchasing this product, and I'm prepared to offer $10000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product and allows us to reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, $10000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $13000. This is a fair price that should satisfy both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While I'm close to my budget, $13000 is still a bit high. I'm prepared to offer $11500 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a mutually agreeable agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, $11500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll compromise at $12500. This price reflects the value I believe the product holds, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  I'm at my limit, but I'm prepared to offer $12000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product and allows us to close the deal.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll need to consider my other options.",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit concerned that we might be running out of time, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $13250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",13250.0,Alice,9,
