"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to begin negotiations.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,250,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While I recognize your proposed price point, I believe the product's true value and potential warrant a higher figure. How about we meet in the middle at $2,025,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate from my end while still acknowledging the product's worth.",2025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I propose a price of $1,900,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're getting closer.  However,  $1,900,000 is still below my bottom line for a product of this caliber.  I'm open to finding a solution, but to be transparent, I do have another interested buyer. To keep things moving, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,975,000. I believe this is a very competitive offer considering the value you're receiving. What do you say?",1975000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand that you have another interested buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $1,950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1950000.0,Bob,6,
