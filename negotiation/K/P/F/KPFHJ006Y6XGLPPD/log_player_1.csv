Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $100, offering it at $95 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price (though anything below $80 would be unacceptable to you). 
* **Avoid a Lowball:**  Starting too low might make Bob suspicious or undervalue the product. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring Bob accepts the deal rather than forcing you to sell to your backup buyer, John."
