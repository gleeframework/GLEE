**Reasoning:**

Alice seems fixated on a price above $13,000 and is unwilling to budge much further. At this point, the potential savings from haggling with Alice are outweighed by the risk of the negotiations falling apart. Buying from John for $15,000 provides a guaranteed price and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation rounds."
