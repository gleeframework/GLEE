I'm starting high, aiming for a profit well above my minimum. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

$900,000 is too low for me. It's below my minimum acceptable value, and I believe I can get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm lowering my price, but still aiming for a significant profit.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob while still ensuring I get a price that's fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is just above my minimum acceptable value and gives me a small profit. While I'd prefer more, it's a good deal considering John's offer.  It's best to secure the sale now and move on."
