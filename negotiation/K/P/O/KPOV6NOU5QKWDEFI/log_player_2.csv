Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you.

Alice has met your bottom line. There's no point in rejecting and potentially missing out on the deal, especially since you have John as a backup at that same price."
