"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's below your maximum price, but you can potentially do better.
* **You have time on your side.** 10 rounds is a lot, so you can afford to try and negotiate a lower price.
* **Buying from John is a fallback option.** If you can't get a better deal with Alice, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000.

By rejecting the offer, you can explore if you can get a lower price from Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's offer, showing your intent to negotiate. 
* **Leaves room for compromise:**  There's still a good gap between your offer and Alice's perceived value, suggesting potential for agreement.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  While a lower offer increases the risk of Alice rejecting, it also potentially yields a better deal.

**Note:**  This counteroffer is based on the information provided.  You could adjust the price based on your risk tolerance and how strongly you believe Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.**  While not ideal, it's a good price considering your maximum budget. 
* **No guarantee of a better deal:** Alice has shown some flexibility, but there's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price.
* **Risk of missing out:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the product to another buyer. 

**Conclusion:** It's a calculated risk to accept.  While you may be able to negotiate lower, it's within your budget, and there's no guarantee of a better outcome."
