Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Justification for price:** By mentioning  ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value,"" you create a sense of desirability and justify the higher price.
* **Direct approach:**  The message is clear and concise, directly stating the price and prompting a response from Bob.

**Why this strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by testing Bob's willingness to pay a premium. If he accepts, you earn significantly more than your minimum. If he rejects, you haven't lost anything and can still sell to John at your desired price."
