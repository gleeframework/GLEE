"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $12,000.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $14,500. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested.",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? That would be a reasonable compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, $13,000 is still too low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate further. How about $13,500? It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",13500.0,Alice,5,
