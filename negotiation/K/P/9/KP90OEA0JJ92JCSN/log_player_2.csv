"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity that I think you won't want to pass up. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for my comfort. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair price that still allows you to get a great deal, while also ensuring I get a good return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, and we have plenty of rounds left to negotiate.  I'm going to try to counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still looking to come in a bit lower. How about $825,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me while also being a good deal for you. Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000, but I need to make a bit more to make it worth my while. How about we settle at $840,000? I think this is a fair price that balances out the value of the product and our negotiation so far. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $840,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $840,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $840,000 which is a good price. There's a chance we can negotiate a bit lower, but with only 5 rounds left, it's not worth the risk of losing the deal altogether.  $840,000 is a good deal for me and it's worth taking at this point."
