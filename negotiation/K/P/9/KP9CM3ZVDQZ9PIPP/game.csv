"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $100 is your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you at that price. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $125. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to agree to $125. Could you possibly lower the price further? I would like to stay within my budget of $100.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really close to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $115. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for the value you'll get.",115.0,Alice,5,
