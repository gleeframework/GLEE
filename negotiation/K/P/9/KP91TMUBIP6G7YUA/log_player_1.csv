"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $10,000, which is a good starting point considering my minimum value is $12,000 and Bob values it at $8,000.  This leaves room for negotiation and a potential compromise.
* **Friendly and encouraging:** The message is positive and invites Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Emphasis on value:**  I highlight the potential value of the product for Bob to encourage him to consider it. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to negotiation, which is important to keep the deal alive.

**Strategic thinking:** I want to see Bob's reaction and gauge his willingness to negotiate.  This first offer allows me to assess if I need to adjust my strategy in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $9,500 for the product. Could we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum value, it's still below my ideal price point. I want to see if I can get closer to my target. 
* **I want to maintain leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I show that I am not desperate for a quick sale and am willing to negotiate further. This puts pressure on Bob to potentially increase his offer. 
* **Testing the waters:** This allows me to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product or just trying to lowball me. 

**Next steps:**

* In the next round, I will make a counteroffer that is closer to $10,000, perhaps around $9,800. 
* I will explain that I'm willing to be flexible, but the product is worth significantly more than what Bob initially offered."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, I'm still firm on a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $9,800?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm willing to be flexible to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer within range:** I'm making a counteroffer of $9,800, which is closer to my initial offer of $10,000 but still significantly higher than Bob's offer of $9,500.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the product's value to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Flexibility and compromise:** I show I am willing to compromise by meeting Bob halfway, while still maintaining a good price for myself. 
* **Positive tone:** I maintain a positive and respectful tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Strategic thinking:**

* This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's seriousness and his willingness to compromise.
* If Bob accepts, I've secured a decent price.
* If Bob rejects, I can adjust my offer in subsequent rounds, keeping in mind John's offer of $12,000 as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate the effort to reach an agreement. I would like to propose a price of $9,600 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between the value of the product and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer of $9,600 is very close to my initial target of $10,000. Accepting this offer would ensure a good profit and avoid the risk of further negotiation.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, and it's not guaranteed that I can get a better offer.  
* **Time is a factor:**  With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer allows me to secure the deal and move on.

**Strategic thinking:**

* I'm choosing to prioritize a reasonable profit over the potential for a slightly higher price. 
* This decision minimizes risk and ensures a positive outcome for the sale."
