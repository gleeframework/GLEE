Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:** Offering a price too close to $15,000 might scare Bob off. By offering a price slightly lower, it increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer. 

**Important Note:** This assumes Alice has no information about Bob's negotiating style or how much he might be willing to pay. If she had more information, the offer could be adjusted accordingly."
