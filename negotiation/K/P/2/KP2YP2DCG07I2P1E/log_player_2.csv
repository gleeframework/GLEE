"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no benefit to accepting it immediately.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, saving you money. 
* Buying from John right now yields no advantage. You haven't even attempted to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm offering a price slightly above Alice's minimum value ($10,000). This increases the likelihood of her accepting the offer.
* This price is still significantly below my maximum price point ($12,000), giving me potential savings. 
* Starting the negotiation with a moderate counteroffer allows for further negotiation rounds if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer is $500 lower than my initial counteroffer and only $500 higher than her minimum value. 
* This is a good deal for me, as it's significantly lower than my maximum price point and still allows Alice to make a profit.
* Buying from John at $12,000 would be a worse deal."
