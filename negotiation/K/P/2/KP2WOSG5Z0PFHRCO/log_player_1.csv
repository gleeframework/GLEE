Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $600,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which still leaves room for profit for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 850000}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's a significant increase, it's still not close enough to my minimum price. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
