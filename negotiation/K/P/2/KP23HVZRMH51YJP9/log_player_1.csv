This offer is significantly less than my minimum value ($1,500,000) but still above what the product is worth to Bob ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while also giving me a strong starting point."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. I am willing to offer $950000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While $950,000 is more than what the product is worth to Bob, it's still below my minimum value. I'm not desperate for a sale and want to see if I can push for a higher price. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Bob's offer:

While $1,000,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still below what I'm hoping to achieve. I'm going to counter Bob's offer again. I'm confident I can secure a better price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've considered your proposal, Alice, and I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1012500. This price respects the value of the product while keeping it within my budget. I hope this suggestion will lead to a satisfactory conclusion for both of us.

While $1,012,500 is still below my ideal price, it's getting very close to my minimum value and I'm starting to feel the pressure of potentially losing a sale.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John at a lower price than I hoped for."
