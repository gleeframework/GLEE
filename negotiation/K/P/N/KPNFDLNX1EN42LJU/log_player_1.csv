"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to increase his motivation to accept. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion, indicating flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.**  Accepting his offer would be a huge loss for me.
* **Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price.** While I'd prefer to earn more, John's offer is a safe and secure option.
* **I have 10 rounds to negotiate with Bob.**  While time is a factor, I don't want to rush into a deal that significantly undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, I need to be closer to $1,350,000 to make this work.  This price still leaves you with a good deal, considering the value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm starting with a counteroffer that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain Value:**  $1,350,000 is still above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profitable deal for me.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" for Bob, highlighting the potential value he'll gain. This encourages him to consider a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $1,350,000. How about we meet at $1,250,000? That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below the $1,500,000 mark. Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Time is a factor:** I've only got 6 rounds left to negotiate with Bob. However, rushing into a deal that undervalues my product would be unwise.
* **Selling to John is a safe option:** John's offer of $1,500,000 guarantees my minimum acceptable price. It's a risk-free option that ensures I don't lose out on significant profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Bob has acknowledged that he is willing to pay more than $1,200,000, giving me some confidence that we can still reach an agreement closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This offer is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm continuing to compromise by lowering my offer again, but this time by a smaller margin ($50,000). This shows a willingness to meet halfway without sacrificing too much.
* **Maintaining Value:** $1,300,000 is still above Bob's perceived value, and closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Time Constraint:** We are now halfway through the negotiation rounds. I need to move the price up while keeping the deal alive.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm reiterating the ""good deal"" for Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think $1,300,000 is a bit steep. How about we meet at $1,250,000 again? I'm willing to pay that price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. I need to be careful about losing time without making significant progress.
* **John's Offer:**  John is still willing to buy the product for $1,500,000, which guarantees my minimum acceptable price.  This is a safe option, but I don't want to give up on a better deal with Bob just yet.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob has shown a willingness to move closer to my desired price. With only four rounds remaining, I believe there's still potential to reach an agreement closer to my target.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly closer to his offer but still above my minimum acceptable price. This will show a willingness to compromise while keeping the negotiation moving forward."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to $1,250,000.  To make this work, I can come down to $1,275,000. It's a compromise from my end, but still a profitable deal for me. I'm hoping we can finalize this in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm offering a small decrease in price, demonstrating flexibility while still staying above my minimum.  
* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to show a willingness to close the deal.
* **Positive Outlook:** I'm expressing hope for a quick agreement to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Value Emphasized:**  I'm reminding Bob that even at $1,275,000, he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle at $1,275,000 is not acceptable, but I can do $1,250,000 is not acceptable either, so I'll meet you at $1,260,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are in round 8, and with only 2 rounds left, time is a critical factor.
* **Significant Loss:** Bob's offer of $1,260,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This is a risk-free option that ensures I don't lose out on significant profit.
* **No Further Compromise:**  Bob has shown that he's unwilling to budge further, making it unlikely we'll reach a mutually acceptable price in the remaining rounds. 

While I would prefer to negotiate further with Bob to try and get a higher price, the risk of losing out on a significant amount of money, coupled with the limited time remaining, makes selling to John the most logical and secure choice at this point."
