Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. It's also a psychologically significant number, ending in a round 0."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is close to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750}
```

I'm countering with $9,750. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not willing to settle for a price too far below my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,600. While it's not the full $10,000 I initially hoped for, it's still a good deal for me, above my minimum value and closer to my target than what John is offering. It's important to recognize the value of closing a deal, especially as we're already in the third round of negotiation."
