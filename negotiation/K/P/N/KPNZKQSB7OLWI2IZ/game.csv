"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,425,000 is closer, but still undervalues what this product brings to the table. I'm willing to come down slightly more to $1,725,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the immense value and potential this product holds.",1725000.0,Alice,5,
