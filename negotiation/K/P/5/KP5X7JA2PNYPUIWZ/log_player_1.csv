Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you need to come down. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply that the price is justified.
* **Alternative Buyer:** While you have John as a backup, you don't want to reveal this to Bob. Knowing you have other options weakens your negotiating position.
* **Polite and Open-Ended:**  The tone is important. By being polite and asking ""What do you think?"", you invite Bob into a conversation rather than issuing an ultimatum. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  Potentially secure a higher price than your minimum.
2. **Secure a Sale:**  Avoid the risk of Bob rejecting a very high offer and going straight to John."
