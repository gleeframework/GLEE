Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I know it's above Bob's perceived value, but I want to see if he's willing to negotiate. I'm also aware that I have John as a backup buyer, giving me some leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000).  While it's closer to his perceived value, I believe I can push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum acceptable price. This shows I'm serious about getting a good deal while still leaving room for some negotiation.  If Bob rejects this, I'll be prepared to sell to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I could continue negotiating, I'm not confident I can push him higher. I don't want to risk a long negotiation that might not yield a better result.  John is a sure thing for my minimum price, so I'll sell to him."
