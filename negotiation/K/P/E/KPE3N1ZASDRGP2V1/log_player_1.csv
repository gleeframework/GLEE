{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your safety net from John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to capture as much of the value difference ($1,500,000 - $800,000 = $700,000) as possible.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,200,000 leaves Bob with a potential profit of $300,000, a strong incentive to buy. This price also nets you a significant profit of $400,000 above your minimum.

This strategy aims to balance securing a deal with maximizing your potential earnings."
