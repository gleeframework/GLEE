Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate a bit lower.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down just a little more to close the deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is the best deal he can get with Alice, and it's significantly lower than John's price.  He's saving $2,900 compared to buying from John. While he could try to counteroffer one more time, there's no guarantee Alice will budge further, and he risks losing the deal entirely.  At this point, accepting and securing the product is the best course of action."
