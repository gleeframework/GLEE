Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable piece, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($1,400,000) because I know the product is worth more to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The initial offer is still below Bob's perceived value, leaving room for him to counter.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value the product offers. 
* **John as a Backup:** I'm keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, providing me with a safety net in case negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my ideal price.
* **Opportunity for Counter-Offer:** I can use this rejection to my advantage by making a counteroffer that bridges the gap. 
* **John is a Safety Net:** Even if I don't reach a deal with Bob, I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not under immediate pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Middle Ground:** It's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, indicating a desire to find a solution that works for both parties.
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes the benefits of a deal, framing it as a win-win situation. 
* **Maintain Pressure:**  The counteroffer still allows me to earn more than John's offer, keeping the pressure on Bob."
