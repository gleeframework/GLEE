{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$400,000 is a great price, but it's too early to commit. We can see if we can get it for less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

I'm starting low to see what Alice's bottom line is.  $250,000 is a significant discount from her original offer, and it gives us room to negotiate."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down in price, which is good.  $350,000 is still too high, but it shows she's willing to negotiate. Let's see if we can push her lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}

I'm going to offer $300,000.  This is a compromise between my last offer and Alice's offer.  Hopefully, she'll see it as a fair price and accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has moved closer to my offer, and $325,000 is a good price.  It's time to lock in the deal and avoid further negotiation."
