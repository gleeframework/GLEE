"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a price of $110. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you is $120.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $105. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we try $95? I'm willing to pay that, but I'm not sure I can go any higher.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. I can see you're interested in the product, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $98, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $98. I'm willing to meet you at $96. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",96.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, Bob. However, I've already compromised significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you at $99, but I'm not going any lower. This is my final counteroffer.",99.0,Alice,7,
