"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to me, but considering its value to you might be different, I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's aim for a price that both of us find acceptable. How about we start at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price, especially since we have the option to buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** We start with a significantly lower offer ($60) than Alice's initial price ($95). This anchors the negotiation lower and leaves us room to move upwards. 
* **Politeness:** Maintaining a polite and respectful tone helps keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Alternative in Mind:** We know we can get the product for $80 from John. This knowledge gives us leverage and allows us to be more assertive in our counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I need to maintain my minimum price to ensure profitability. I'm willing to negotiate down from $120, but not below $85. This still allows me to cover costs and make a reasonable profit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably, but her offer is still above our target price and what John is offering.  We have room to negotiate further, so we'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to our desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $75? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:** We're proposing a price that's roughly halfway between Alice's last offer ($85) and our previous counteroffer ($60). This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** By saying ""meet in the middle,"" we frame the offer as fair and reasonable.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** We still have some room to move upwards towards $80 if needed, but we're getting closer to our ideal outcome."
