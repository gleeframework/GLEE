Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price of $175. This is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also higher than what John is offering, so I'm not losing out on a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try to get a bit more. I can likely get closer to my desired price of $175 in another round of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 165}
```

I'm going to counter with $165. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, but still leaves some room for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $160 is only $5 less than my ideal price. At this point, I'm happy to accept and avoid further negotiation. It's a good deal and avoids the risk of him rejecting again or me having to sell to John for less."
