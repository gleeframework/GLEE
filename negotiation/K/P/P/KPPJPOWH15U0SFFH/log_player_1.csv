Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high.  This leaves room for negotiation and might lead to an even larger profit. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, justifying the high price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You know your minimum acceptable price, but gauging his reactions will be key to maximizing your profit."
