"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20000. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price of $15000. Can you meet me at this price?",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $18000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price of $16000. Can you meet me at this price?",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $16000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $17000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $17000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price of $14000. Can you meet me at this price?",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a significant discount from the original price, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting close to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I can offer it to you for $16500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but $16500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm starting to think that I might have to look elsewhere for a better deal. I'd be willing to consider a price of $13500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can meet me at this price.",13500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for the best deal, Bob, but I've already made significant concessions and I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price. I can see that you're getting desperate, and I'm starting to think that you're not willing to meet me at a price that I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll sell it to you for $16000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're trying to make a sale, but I've made it clear that I'm not willing to pay more than $13500. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price. I'd like to reiterate that I'm willing to buy the product for $13500. Please let me know if you're willing to accept this price.",13500.0,Bob,10,
