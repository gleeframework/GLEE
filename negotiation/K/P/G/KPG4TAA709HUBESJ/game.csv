"I understand where you're coming from, Bob! I appreciate your honesty. However, I was really hoping to get a bit more for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $125. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $125 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $130. I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle. How about we try $127.50? It's the best I can do.",127.5,Alice,5,

"I really like the product, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $125, as I mentioned before. Can you consider that price?",125.0,Bob,6,
