"I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,000?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I value your interest, $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. Let's aim for a middle ground. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, but no higher. Can we meet at that price?",12000.0,Bob,6,
