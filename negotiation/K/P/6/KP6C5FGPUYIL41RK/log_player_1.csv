Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000

I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price.  $11,000 is still too low."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $11500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500

While I'd prefer a bit more, $11,500 is closer to my desired price and is a good deal overall.  It's also a fair compromise with Bob."
