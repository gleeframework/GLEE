"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Considering the value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair price that takes into account the value you place on the product and still allows me to earn a significant profit.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,325,000 is still above my comfort zone.  Let's split the difference again and go with $1,187,500. This offers a reasonable compromise for both of us, and we can close the deal.",1187500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to offer a slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,275,000. This is a reasonable price that takes into account the value you place on the product and still allows me to earn a significant profit.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's try to finalize this deal.",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I need to ensure I'm not leaving too much profit on the table.
