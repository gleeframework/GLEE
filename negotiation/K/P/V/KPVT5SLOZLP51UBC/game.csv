"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,300,000 is a starting point, it falls short of the true value this product represents. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000.  This revised price reflects the unique benefits and potential  this product offers.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,800,000 remains outside my budget.  To make progress, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,400,000. This price reflects a fair compromise and demonstrates my sincere interest in acquiring this product.  Let's aim for a mutually agreeable solution.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
