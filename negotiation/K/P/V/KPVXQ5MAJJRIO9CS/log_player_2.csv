"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first. $130 is still quite a bit higher than our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for us to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. $60 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? Let's make this deal happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $95 is still above our target price. We'll counter-offer and see if we can get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

We're inching closer to our ideal price.  We'll see if Alice is willing to meet us in this range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is down to $85, which is within our $80 budget. While we could try to negotiate further, it's getting close to our limit, and there's no guarantee Alice will go lower. It's better to secure the deal at a reasonable price."
