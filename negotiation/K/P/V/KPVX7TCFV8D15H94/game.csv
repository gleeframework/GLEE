,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product but I can only go up to $120. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $120 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $145? I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $145 is still a bit higher than my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $135?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
