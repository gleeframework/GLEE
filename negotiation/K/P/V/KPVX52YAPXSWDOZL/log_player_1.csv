Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal to someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  Since I know Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price well above my minimum. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A starting offer of $15,000 gives Bob the impression that I'm willing to negotiate, potentially leading to a more agreeable price than if I started too low.
* **Backup Option:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial limits. If I had more information about Bob, I might adjust my approach."
