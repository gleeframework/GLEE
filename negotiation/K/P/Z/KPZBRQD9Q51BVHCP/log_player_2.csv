Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,000,000 yet. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about $1,015,000? This is as low as I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only a few rounds left, Alice is unlikely to move much further. Waiting could result in her becoming firmer on her price. 
* **Savings:** $1,015,000 is a significant saving compared to John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Further haggling might only yield small concessions from Alice. It's likely not worth the risk of losing the deal for a slightly lower price."
