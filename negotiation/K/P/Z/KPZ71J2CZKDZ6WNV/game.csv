"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This still gives you a great deal, as the product is worth $15,000 to you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
