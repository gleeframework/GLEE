"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $10,000 is still above his maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer, close to his maximum budget, to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. He's aiming to save as much as possible, but he's also leaving some room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested, but $8,500 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,250 is closer to his budget, it's still above his target. He's willing to continue negotiating to see if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750. It's a fair price that's within my budget and also allows you to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $8,750, a price that is closer to his target of $8,000 but still leaves room for some compromise. He is trying to find a middle ground and aims to secure a deal within the next few rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and I believe it's the best we can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. $9,000 is getting closer to his budget, but he's willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and get an even better price. He's also aware that he can always buy the product from John for $8,000, which gives him some negotiating power."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,800. This price is a fair compromise and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a price that is very close to his target of $8,000, but also higher than his previous offer. He wants to show Alice that he is serious about buying the product, but also that he is not willing to pay more than $8,800. He is hoping that Alice will accept this offer, but if she doesn't, he is prepared to buy the product from John for $8,000."
