Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm eager to sell, I'm hoping for a higher price. I'll see if I can get closer to my goal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I appreciate you're interested, but $8,500 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,750. It's a fair price that's within my budget and also allows you to get a good deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, I'm still holding out for a price closer to $10,000.  I think there's still room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,750 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and I believe it's the best we can do."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,800. This price is a fair compromise and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  While Bob is getting closer to my ideal price, we're running out of time.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum desired price, and I don't want to risk losing out on a sure thing."
