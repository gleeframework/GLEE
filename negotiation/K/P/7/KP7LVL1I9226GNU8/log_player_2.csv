"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. Based on its unique capabilities and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This price reflects the significant value I know it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,150,000 is a decent price, it's still higher than Alice's value of $1,000,000. This means there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."
