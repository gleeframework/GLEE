Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. While I see its potential, $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. To make this a mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair valuation while still allowing you a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
