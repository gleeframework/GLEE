"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value. While I see its potential, $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. To make this a mutually beneficial deal, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000. I'm confident this price reflects a fair valuation while still allowing you a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, it's a bit lower than what I'm hoping to achieve.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still allows for a significant profit for me while remaining within a reasonable range for you.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price that allows for a comfortable margin.  I'm willing to offer $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied.  Let's work towards finalizing this deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
