"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer of $1200000, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1250000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and the value it holds for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1250000. How about $1225000?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your compromise of $1225000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1225000 and $1250000, but I'd like to propose a slightly higher price. How about $1237500? I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement at this price.",1237500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your proposal, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1200000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I think we can find a better balance. How about $1230000?",1230000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your concession to $1230000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I'll propose a price of $1235000. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",1235000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $1200000. I'm willing to make a final concession, but I think we can find a better balance. How about $1215000?",1215000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your concession to $1215000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I've made it clear that I'm looking for a price closer to my minimum of $1500000. I'm starting to lose patience and consider other options. My final counteroffer is $1200000, but I'm not getting any lower than this. This is my last offer.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
