"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I know it's worth at least $150 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $120. This is a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $80 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

While Alice's offer is below her own valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum price and what John offers. You can do better by rejecting this offer."
