"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiation, but I need to get at least $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the asset. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, though.  How about $875,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. Let's try to find a middle ground.",875000.0,Alice,3,
