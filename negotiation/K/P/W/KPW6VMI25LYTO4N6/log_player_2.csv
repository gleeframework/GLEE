"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset with a lot of potential, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm open to negotiation, but I need to get at least $900,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While the product is valuable, Alice's initial price is still above Bob's maximum budget.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the asset. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, though.  How about $875,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still above his ideal price, it's within his budget and represents a good compromise. It's better than rejecting the offer and risking Alice raising the price again, or going with John and missing out on potentially negotiating a lower price with Alice in the future."
