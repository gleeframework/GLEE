Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to us, we're considering a price of $14,000. We believe this is a fair offer, considering its worth to you is $12,000. Let me know if this aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer of $14,000 is above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.
