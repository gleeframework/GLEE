"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can aim for a lower price and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to his ideal value. This shows he's serious about negotiating but also leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down to $10,000. That's still a good deal for both of us, considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is a good deal for Bob, it's still above his ideal price. He has already shown a willingness to negotiate, and there's still room to potentially get closer to his target. Rejecting the offer will give Bob the opportunity to counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still not quite there yet. How about $9,800? That's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing he's willing to compromise.  He's aiming for a price very close to his ideal, and this offer should be tempting for Alice, as she's already indicated a willingness to negotiate."
