Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial high price will give you insight into his level of interest and potential price sensitivity. 
* **Alternative Option:**  You have the safety net of John's offer ($100), so there's less pressure to immediately accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm not sure I can go that high. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches his valuation of the product, it's too early to accept.  There's still room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you believe the product is worth more and open the door for a potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $125? This feels like a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counter-offer shows willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $125 is a reasonable middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. 
* **Maintaining Value:**  You're still aiming for a price significantly above your minimum ($100), reflecting the product's worth to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $110.  This would be a fair price and would allow us both to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $110 is still a $10 profit over your minimum acceptable price and John's standing offer.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments, and there's a risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now avoids potentially lengthy negotiations and ensures you get paid promptly."
