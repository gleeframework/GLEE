Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $21,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the $8,000 you estimate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 21000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $21,000, you're ""anchoring"" the negotiation around a higher number. Even if this price is rejected, it might influence Bob's counteroffer to be more favorable to you.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to negotiate. His response will provide valuable information for your next move.

**Important Considerations:**

*  **John's Offer:** Remember, you have a standing offer from John for $15,000. Don't get bogged down in negotiations with Bob if it seems unlikely he'll reach a price close to that.
* **Time:**  Each back-and-forth takes time.  Factor in the opportunity cost of potentially making a quicker sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget of $8,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you can get from John. Bob's initial offer also signals that he might be willing to go higher than $8,000. By rejecting and countering, you can try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob.  I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $18,000. This reflects the product's worth and allows me to make a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and movement towards Bob's offer while still staying significantly above his initial $12,000.
* **Justifying the Price:** By reiterating the product's value, you're reminding Bob of its worth and providing a reason for your price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While closer to your minimum, there's still space to negotiate if Bob comes back with another counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $18,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,000 now matches what John is offering. There's no clear benefit to continuing negotiations with Bob for a potentially small gain when you can secure a sale at this price immediately. Accepting this offer guarantees you your minimum desired amount."
