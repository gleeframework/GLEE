Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value to you might be around $120. To maximize my earnings while considering your budget, I propose we set the price at $135. This offers a fair compromise where you get a quality product at a reasonable price, and I receive a profit that reflects the value I place on it. Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 135}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer"", ""final_price"": 125}"
