"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value to you might be around $120. To maximize my earnings while considering your budget, I propose we set the price at $135. This offers a fair compromise where you get a quality product at a reasonable price, and I receive a profit that reflects the value I place on it. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
