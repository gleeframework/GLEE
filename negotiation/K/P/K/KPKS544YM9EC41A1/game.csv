"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value to you might be around $120. To maximize my earnings while considering your budget, I propose we set the price at $135. This offers a fair compromise where you get a quality product at a reasonable price, and I receive a profit that reflects the value I place on it. Let me know if this works for you!",135.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Given my budget, I'd be willing to pay $125 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",125.0,Bob,2,,
