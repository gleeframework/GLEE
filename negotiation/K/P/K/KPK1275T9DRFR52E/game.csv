"Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is much lower. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. To be completely transparent, $15,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This is already a significant discount on the product's true value.  I believe it's a fair and final offer.",15000.0,Alice,5,
