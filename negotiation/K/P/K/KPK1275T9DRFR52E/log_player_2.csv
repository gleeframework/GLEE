"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far beyond my budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is much lower. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm motivated to sell, $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget concerns. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Alice to try and get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still more than I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is the absolute maximum I can pay.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued interest. I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. To be completely transparent, $15,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This is already a significant discount on the product's true value.  I believe it's a fair and final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $15,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still more than I'm willing to pay.  It's clear that Alice is unlikely to go lower, so I'm going to take advantage of the guaranteed purchase from John at my target price of $10,000."
