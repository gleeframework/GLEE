Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $120. I believe it offers excellent value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations slightly above your target price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering a price of $120 leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and potentially meet somewhere in the middle, which would still be above your minimum price of $100.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception of its worth.

It's important to remember:
* **Alternative Option (John):** You always have John as a backup buyer at $100. This gives you leverage and means you don't have to accept an offer below your minimum.
* **Bob's Valuation:** While Bob values the product at $80, he might be willing to pay a bit more if he's convinced of its value or if he's highly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $100. While it's closer to your target, you have the leverage of John's offer.  You'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $105? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for the value this product offers."", 
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise. It's a common negotiation tactic that can feel fair to both parties.
* **Above Minimum, Below Initial:** The price of $105 is above your $100 minimum and below your initial $120 offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Value:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly justifying the price point. 

**Strategy:** By coming down by $15 while only asking Bob to come up by $15, you're demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a price that benefits you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $95. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $95 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $100. While he's incrementally increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll meet your $100 threshold.  At this point, it's more profitable to cut your losses and sell the product to John for a guaranteed $100."
