"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push him a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this shows him that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I believe the product is worth more than $13,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting closer to my ideal price. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that he could reject my next counteroffer or that I could lose him as a buyer entirely. It's better to secure a sale now."
