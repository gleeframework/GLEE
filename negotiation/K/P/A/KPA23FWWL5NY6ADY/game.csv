"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $12000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $11500. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $11500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference at $10750? That would be a fair deal for both of us.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a fair approach. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11250. That way, I can still make a decent profit and you'll get a great deal. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $11250 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $11000. It's a fair compromise and allows us both to walk away happy.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $11000, but I need to make a bit more on this deal. How about we do $11250, and I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal?",11250.0,Alice,7,
