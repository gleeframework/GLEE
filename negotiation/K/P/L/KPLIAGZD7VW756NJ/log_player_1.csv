Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $100 is still lower than Bob's perceived value of $120, meaning he has room to gain from the deal. 
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and positive tone in my message makes Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation. 

I'm hoping that Bob will either accept my initial offer or counter with a price closer to $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $100 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my desired price range.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower offer from Bob, or a protracted negotiation process.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to Bob at $90 is a better outcome than selling to John at $80. 

I'm taking this offer to secure a good price and avoid the uncertainty of further negotiation."
