"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $14,000 is closer, but it's still a bit beyond my reach at the moment.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $13,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a good price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer.",13500.0,Alice,5,
