Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Given its potential, I'm confident this is a worthwhile investment. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aim High, Room to Negotiate:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than both your minimum and Bob's perceived value leaves space for negotiation. It also positions the product as potentially highly lucrative.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's enthusiasm. If he's immediately put off by the price, you can always lower it. But if he's intrigued, you have room to secure a price well above your minimum. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale with John at $800,000 gives you leverage. It allows you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you have any insights into Bob's negotiation style (e.g., aggressive, cautious), you can tailor your message accordingly.
* **Product Uniqueness:** If the product is truly unique and in high demand, you can justify the higher price more easily."
