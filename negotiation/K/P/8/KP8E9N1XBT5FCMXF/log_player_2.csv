"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum price.  It makes sense to reject and start negotiating.  You can try to lower the price significantly in your counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's potential value, $1,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, making it clear that you're serious about negotiating. This also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice counter-offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above your maximum price. Since you have 7 rounds left, it's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price. You can try a counteroffer closer to your desired price point of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a firm offer at your maximum price. It signifies that you are serious about buying the product, but won't pay more. It also sets a clear expectation for the next round, either Alice accepts or you move to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,020,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price of $1,000,000. Since you have 5 rounds remaining, it's worth pushing further to try and reach a deal that works for you.  You can counter with an offer closer to your budget, or even hold firm at $1,000,000, depending on your risk tolerance."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,020,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to offer you $1,000,000 for the product, which is my final offer.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already rejected Alice's previous offer, and with 4 rounds remaining, it's time to stick to your maximum price.  By repeating your previous offer and stating it's final, you put the pressure on Alice to decide. If she rejects, you can move to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go below $1,020,000. However, I'll make one more attempt to reach a deal. I'll meet you at $1,015,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll have to consider other options, including selling to John for $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,015,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price. With only 3 rounds left, and her threat to sell to John at a higher price, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation. Buying from John at your maximum price guarantees you get the product without further hassle or uncertainty."
