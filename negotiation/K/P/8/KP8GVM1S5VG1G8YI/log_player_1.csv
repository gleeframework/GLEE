Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 150}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, as it's worth $100 to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $120?  It's a high-quality product, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $90. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob seems pretty set on $90.  It's not worth going any lower and risking getting less than John's guaranteed offer."
