"I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $12,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  What do you say?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from your last offer. How about $13,250?",13250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $13,250 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference again, and I offer the product for $13,375?  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",13375.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still not convinced about the price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $13,000? I think that's a fair price for the product.",13000.0,Bob,6,
