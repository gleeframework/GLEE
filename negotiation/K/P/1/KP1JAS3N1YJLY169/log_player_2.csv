# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $1800000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is at least $1500000. I think you'll find it's well worth the investment. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit too low for me. Considering its true value to me is at least $1500000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000. This is a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal. What do you think?
