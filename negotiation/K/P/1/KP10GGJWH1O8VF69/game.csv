"Thanks for the offer Alice, but the price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a deal for $9,000. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, but I think that's the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $8,000, which is my minimum price.",8000.0,Alice,5,
