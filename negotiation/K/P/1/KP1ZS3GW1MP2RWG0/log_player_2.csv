"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great deal for you on this fantastic product! I'm willing to let it go for $100. It's a steal at this price, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is a decent price, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. There's a chance Alice might come down in price if you reject her initial offer."
