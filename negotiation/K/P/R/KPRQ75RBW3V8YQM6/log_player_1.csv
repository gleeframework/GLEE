Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140} 
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a high likelihood of Bob accepting. Here's why:

* **Value to Bob:** Bob values the product at $150, so $140 is a good price for him. He gets a discount and you get a good price.
* **Your Minimum:** Your minimum acceptable price is $120.  $140 is well above that, ensuring you make a decent profit.
* **John as Backup:** If Bob rejects, you have John as a backup buyer at $120, so you're not taking a significant risk."
