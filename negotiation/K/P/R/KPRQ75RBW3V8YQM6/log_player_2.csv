"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Buying from Alice:** You'd pay $140, but the product is worth $150 to you, so you'd make a $10 profit.
* **Buying from John:** You'd pay $150, and the product is worth $150 to you, so you'd break even.

It's better to accept Alice's offer as you get a profit of $10."
