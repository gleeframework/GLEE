"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's make this happen.",16000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $13,500 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $14,750? That's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",14750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,750 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet at $14,000? That's the best I can do.",14000.0,Bob,6,
