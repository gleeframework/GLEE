"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further and finding a price that works for us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high ($2,300,000) compared to your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  Even if the negotiation fails, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  your offer is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.  It's still higher than my maximum budget, but it leaves room for further negotiation.  This approach allows me to explore a potential deal without immediately resorting to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the price you're suggesting is considerably below what I can accept.  This product holds significant intrinsic value, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?  This acknowledges the value it holds while recognizing your initial investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still too high for me.  I'm not willing to go above my $1,000,000 budget. I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing my offer while still remaining within my comfort zone. It's a substantial increase from my previous offer, showing flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement. It also leaves room for further negotiation if Alice is unwilling to accept this price."
