"Alice,  your offer is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but the price you're suggesting is considerably below what I can accept.  This product holds significant intrinsic value, and I'm confident it can generate substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?  This acknowledges the value it holds while recognizing your initial investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
