"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, I can't go that low. $11500 is below my minimum price.  How about we split the difference and meet at $12750? It's still a great deal for you, considering you value the product at $15000. Let's work together to make this happen!",12750.0,Alice,3,
