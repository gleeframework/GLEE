I'm aiming for a higher price than $10,000. I will try to negotiate with Bob to reach a mutually agreeable price before considering selling to John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your offer, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? This would still give you a great deal on a high-quality product."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $11,750.  I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a bit more in the next round.  However, if he doesn't budge, I might consider selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $11,750 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's try $12,000. This price is fair to both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 12000}
