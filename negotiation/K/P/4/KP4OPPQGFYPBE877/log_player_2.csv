"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to get the product for under $1,500,000 and Alice's offer is already at $1,400,000. 
* **Negotiation is necessary.** Rejecting the offer allows you to start a counter-offer process, potentially getting a better price. 
* **John is a backup option.** Knowing you can buy from John for $1,500,000 gives you leverage in your negotiation with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to come out ahead. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate.
