"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! Would you like to purchase it from me for $10000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further, as you can potentially save $2,000 compared to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can do $9200 for you, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is better than John's, but there's still room for negotiation. It's worth another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,200 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,850?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8850}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $9000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than John's offer, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will get a better price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a decent price."
