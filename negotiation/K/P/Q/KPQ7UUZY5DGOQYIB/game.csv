"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to prioritize getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $900000?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $750000 for the product. This is a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $850000.
