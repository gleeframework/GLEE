Considering its worth to you is $12,000, I am offering it to you at a special price of $10,000. This is an exclusive offer tailored to recognize your appreciation for the product. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $12,000 from John if necessary.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further in a subsequent negotiation since the product is only worth $8,000 to her."
