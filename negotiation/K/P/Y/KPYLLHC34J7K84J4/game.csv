"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I place on the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,000.  This price is still fair to me, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",12000.0,Alice,5,
