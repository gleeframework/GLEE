{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I highlight the value Bob will get from the product to encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $14,000 is a good starting point that allows for potential compromise if Bob counteroffers. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm comfortable ending negotiations if Bob doesn't meet my price expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $11,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he is interested and open to negotiation. 
* **Counteroffering is the Best Option:** I can counter with a price higher than $11,000, aiming to find a middle ground. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe I can get a better price from Bob through continued negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective. While $11,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to the value I place on the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlight the Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob will get at this price, making it more appealing to him.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  The phrase ""meeting in the middle"" suggests a fair and reasonable compromise, making the offer seem more attractive.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends with an open question, encouraging Bob to respond and continue the negotiation.

By counteroffering at $12,500, I aim to find a price that is acceptable to both Bob and me, without having to sell to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $11,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:**  $11,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While it is closer to my price, it is still too low. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:** Bob has shown willingness to negotiate by increasing his offer. This indicates further negotiation might be fruitful. 
* **Counteroffer:** I believe I can still push for a higher price, but I need to be strategic in my counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:** While tempting, I am not ready to accept John's offer yet, as I have a good chance of getting a higher price from Bob with continued negotiation. 

I will counteroffer with a price closer to $12,500, trying to find a middle ground while staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $12,000.  This price is still fair to me, and it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer of $12,500. This demonstrates continued flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I reiterate the product's value to Bob to incentivize him to accept. 
* **Finality:**  I subtly suggest that this might be my final offer, putting a bit of pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $12,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't sell for less than what I believe the product is worth. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, avoiding the need to sell to John and potentially securing a higher price."
