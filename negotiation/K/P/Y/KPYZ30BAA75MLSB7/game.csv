"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you considering my interest. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my price range.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
