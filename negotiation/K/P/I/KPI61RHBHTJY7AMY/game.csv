"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700000 for the product. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're willing to consider.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700000 to the right buyer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $775000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I place on the product and the value it can bring to your business.",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value you see in the product, I'm still aiming to keep my expenses within my set budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $725000 for the product. I hope this offers a reasonable compromise between our positions.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your desire to stay within your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $750000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair compromise given the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my previous offer, so I'm offering the product to you for $737500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",737500.0,Alice,5,
