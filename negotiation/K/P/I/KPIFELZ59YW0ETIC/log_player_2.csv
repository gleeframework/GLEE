"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close, Bob! I can do $102, but that's as low as I can go. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and at $102, you're saving a decent amount compared to John's offer."
