"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a serious offer. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm not quite ready to accept $750000. I'm willing to consider a compromise, though. I'm thinking of a price of $850000. It's a fair middle ground that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're not willing to go down to $750000, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $800000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
