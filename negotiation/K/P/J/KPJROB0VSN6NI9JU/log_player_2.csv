Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $9,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to go a bit higher and meet you at $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

It's clear Alice is unlikely to budge much lower than $14,000. To maximize savings and stay within budget, it's time to take the guaranteed deal with John for $10,000."
