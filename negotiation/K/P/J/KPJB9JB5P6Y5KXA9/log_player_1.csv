"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, aiming to capture as much of the potential profit as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While $1,150,000 is a significant amount, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate and still be within his desired value. 
* **Balancing Risk and Reward:** This offer balances the risk of Bob rejecting it against the potential reward of a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

I will observe Bob's response. If he rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's within my acceptable range.  If his offer is too low, I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer. 

I will also keep in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob become too difficult or time-consuming."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,150,000, and it's also closer to John's offer of $1,000,000.  
* **More Negotiating Room:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob.  He clearly values the product at $1,200,000, so there's a potential for a higher price.
* **Avoiding Immediate Sell:**  While selling to John is an option, I'm not ready to accept his offer yet. I'm hoping to get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer. I need to find a balance between pushing for a higher price and not risking a complete deal breakdown."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a compromise between my initial offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's offer of $1,050,000. It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but still seek a price closer to my desired value.
* **Staying Above John's Offer:**  This counteroffer keeps me above John's offer of $1,000,000, ensuring that I don't lose out on potential profit if I eventually have to sell to him.
* **Maintaining Negotiation Leverage:**  By offering a lower price than my initial offer, I'm showing flexibility, but I'm still leaving room for a few more rounds of negotiation. This allows me to assess Bob's willingness to meet my price while also leaving open the possibility of a better deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects it, I'll need to consider whether to lower my price further or to sell to John if my desired price seems unattainable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly lower than my desired price, and it's only $75,000 above John's offer. 
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  We are already in round 4, and I still have time to negotiate a higher price.  Bob is clearly willing to pay more than $1,000,000, so I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Avoiding Premature Selling:**  Selling to John now would only result in a $75,000 profit, which is not ideal given the potential for a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will make another counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. I'll consider his offer and my remaining time in the negotiation process when determining the exact amount."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1090000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** This counteroffer is a small step down from my previous offer of $1,100,000, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. It also keeps the price above John's offer and within a reasonable range for Bob.
* **Time is Running Out:** We are now in round 5, and I need to make a decision that balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing the deal. 
* **Testing Bob's Limit:**  This offer tests Bob's willingness to meet my price. If he rejects it, I'll need to consider selling to John or making a final counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

I will closely analyze Bob's response.  If he rejects this offer, I'll need to decide between selling to John or making a final counteroffer to Bob."
