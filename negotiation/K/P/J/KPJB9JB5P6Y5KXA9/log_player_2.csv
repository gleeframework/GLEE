"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's worth to her ($1,000,000).  It's worth exploring if we can get a lower price by counter-offering. We have 10 rounds, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above the product's value to her. This should encourage Alice to negotiate further, while also showing our serious interest in buying the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price, which is good, but it's still above the product's value to her. It's worth seeing if we can get a lower price by counter-offering again. We have 7 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our offer slightly from the previous round.  This shows Alice that we're serious about buying the product, but we're still pushing for a lower price.  We're still well below Alice's current offer and within our budget."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and this price is close to the product's value to her.  While we could continue to negotiate, we're getting close to our budget. It's a good deal and we have 5 rounds left to spare."
