"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum price of $120.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $120. He's offering $110, leaving room for negotiation but demonstrating a willingness to compromise. This should start the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $130 is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still higher. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price and potentially get a better deal.  He has a few more rounds to work with, and there's always the option of buying from John as a fallback."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again aiming for a price closer to his maximum of $120. He's offering $115, which is halfway between his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This shows that Bob is willing to compromise and hopefully incentivize Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's desired price.  Although time is running out, Bob has a few rounds left and can still try to negotiate a better deal.  It's worth pushing for a lower price, especially since John is a reliable alternative if the negotiations with Alice fall through."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

This is Bob's final attempt to get the product for his maximum price.  He's offering $120, which is his limit.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob has the option of buying from John for the same price.  This puts the pressure on Alice to accept, as she is unlikely to find a buyer willing to pay more than $120."
