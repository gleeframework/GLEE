"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the deal, I'm hoping to get it for a little less.  How about $10,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  How about we split the difference again and go with $10,500?  This would be a good deal for both of us and would help us reach an agreement quickly.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finally close this deal.",10750.0,Alice,5,
