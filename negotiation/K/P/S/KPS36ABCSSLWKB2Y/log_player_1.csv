"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still do better.  I'm confident that with further negotiation, I can reach a price closer to my initial offer.  Selling to John at this point would mean leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the product's value while also offering you a fair price.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,075,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I have five rounds left and I believe I can still achieve a better price with further negotiation.  Selling to John at this point would be losing out on a significant profit opportunity."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me.  Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1087500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,087,500. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,075,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob is standing firm at $1,075,000, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I have four rounds left and I'm confident I can get a better price.  While selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe bet, it would leave a significant amount of money on the table.  I'm going to continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budgetary constraints. Let's try one final compromise.  I'm willing to come down to $1,080,000, which is just a slight increase from your last offer.  This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the value you'll receive. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1080000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate Alice's flexibility, but $1,080,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one last attempt to negotiate. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,075,000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but I have to choose option (3) and sell the product to John.

* **Bob's offer is stuck:** Bob is clearly unwilling to go higher, and we've reached an impasse.
* **Time is running out:** We only have two rounds left.  If I reject Bob's offer, there's no guarantee he will counteroffer again.
* **Minimizing losses:**  While selling to John is not ideal, it's better than accepting a price that's significantly below my minimum acceptable value. 

I'm not happy with this outcome, but it's the most rational choice based on the available information and the limited time remaining."
