"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the price you're willing to sell it for. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",8750.0,Bob,4,
